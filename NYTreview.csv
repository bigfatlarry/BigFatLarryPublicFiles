‽A Chronicle of Corpses‽,‽Here's a real UFO, an extremely low-budget, genuinely independent film by a 22-year-old writer-director from Philadelphia that immediately establishes a distinctive and promising voice. 
Andrew Repasky McElhinney's ''Chronicle of Corpses'' is a gothic horror tale set in the early 19th century on the grounds of a dying slave plantation somewhere in the Middle Atlantic states. Though once the center of a thriving economy, the plantation has degenerated into inertia and neglect, largely as a result of the deepening decadence of its ruling family, the Elliots. 
Grandmother (Marj Dusay, of the soap ''All My Children'') has retreated into wordless dementia, leaving the family affairs in the hands of assorted offspring and in-laws, most of whom have serious problems with drinking and sex. There are a priest (Jerry Perna) still on retainer, a saucy young Irish servant (Margot White) who preserves what's left of the plantation's rapidly dimming life force, and the family's youngest member, Sara (Ryan Foley), a haunted teenager, who together represent what resistance there is to the dark forces gathering both inside the family and outside the house. 
Something strange and possibly supernatural is rampaging through the woods around the Elliot compound, selecting its victims at random and destroying them in assorted awful ways. Mr. McElhinney is careful not to overdefine his metaphors: the monster represents at once the waning of a singularly unjust period of American history and the manifestation of a particular disease infecting American families. 
Shooting on 16-millimeter film and using a cast drawn largely from local theater groups, Mr. McElhinney has created a movie that is not without the flaws endemic in low-budget productions but still projects an amazing degree of stylistic assurance and originality. 
Unlike most of today's indie directors, he shows no interest in jittery, hand-held compositions. His film consists of strongly framed long shots in which the characters speak largely in mumbling monotones while remaining motionless, a style that recalls at once the deliberately zomboid acting of Edgar G. Ulmer's grade-Z classics of the 1940's (''Detour,'' ''Strange Illusion'') and the Brechtian alienation techniques of experimental European filmmakers like Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet. The film takes on a hushed, ritualized tone as the bodies begin to pile up, and the family confines itself more and more to the plantation's chapel. 
Mr. McElhinney is obviously an experienced cinephile (he is also the programmer of a long-running film society in Philadelphia, the Chestnut Hill Film Group), but his film doesn't drown in show-offy references to old movies. It is more a case of an antique aesthetic absorbed and revived. 
Though the technology is no longer available to create the kind of stately, formal tracking shots that Ulmer specialized in, Mr. McElhinney and his cinematographer, Abe Holtz, have been able to recreate the dreamy, fateful sense of those shots by using a Steadycam mount. 
''A Chronicle of Corpses'' belongs to the small but significant tradition of outsider art in American movies -- films like Herk Harvey's ''Carnival of Souls'' or George Romero's ''Night of the Living Dead'' -- that reflect powerful personalities formed outside any academic or professional tradition. That most of these are horror films is no coincidence; they are the films that haunt American cinema, pointing to paths that were never taken, to doors that remain firmly closed.

‽
‽Hamlet‽,‽If any contemporary American actor was born to play the melancholy Dane in Shakespeare's ''Hamlet,'' it is Campbell Scott, who conveys a smoldering intelligence softened by a residual tenderness. These qualities are embodied not only in Mr. Campbell's haunted eyes and sunken lips but also in a rich musical voice whose oratorical roll enfolds many quivering notes, including several shades of hysteria. 
Mr. Scott has portrayed Hamlet twice onstage, in 1990 at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego and in 1996 at the Huntington Theater in Boston. This second production, directed by Eric Simonson, was filmed for television, with Mr. Scott as co-director; it played last year on the Odyssey Channel and is opening today at the Screening Room. Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen. It is, in a word, compelling. 
The actor, who looks a good decade younger than his 39 years, portrays Hamlet as an excitable, overprotected youth whose idealism is abruptly shattered with a single traumatic revelation. Forced to grow up and recognize the evil of the world, he alternates between a near-suicidal despair and an adolescent rage that drives him to try to right all the wrong he sees. Once embarked on his vengeful path, he is seized with brainstorms so intense they drive him to the brink of insanity, which he is smart enough to recognize but nearly powerless to control. 
Mr. Scott's Hamlet is very American without being at all colloquial. His interpretation is so clearly conceived that you can read Hamlet's thoughts from moment to moment. The essence of his performance is embodied in his ''To be or not to be'' speech, which he delivers after smashing his own eyeglasses and cutting his arm with a shard. Fighting back the impulse toward self-destruction, he sinks to the floor and delivers the soliloquy lying down in an intense, agitated murmur. Even at his most maniacal, Mr. Scott's Hamlet remains sympathetic, the only voice of truth in a climate poisoned by lies. He is the incarnation of frantic, anguished sincerity. 
The movie is set in a post-Civil War America that vaguely suggests the South without being specific as to location. There is a cannon on the front lawn. And when the royals go outside to frolic, you can imagine them sipping juleps and toasting the memory of Robert E. Lee. The grandeur of the palatial mansion in which the action unfolds and the overripe lushness of the surrounding trees and lawns suggest a Southern aristocracy decaying beneath a proudly noble facade. 
The choice of black actors to play Polonius (Roscoe Lee Browne), Ophelia (LisaGay Hamilton) and Laertes (Roger Guenveur Smith) also suggests the remnants of a plantation culture. Moreover, it astutely underscores their family ties and a subservience to the royal family that make Laertes's outrage all the more sympathetic once his father and sister have died. Although Ms. Hamilton's somewhat tough Ophelia goes against the character's traditionally fragile grain, her descent into madness stays reasonably credible. 
But the movie's Southern flavor remains just a suggestion. None of the characters have Southern accents. 
Blair Brown, an actress of enormous subtlety and depth whose work grows richer every year, is as complex a Gertrude as I have seen. An aristocratic woman of a certain age, hypnotized by Claudius's power (sexual and otherwise), she glides through much of the film in a smiling trance, aglow with passion but almost visibly trembling underneath. When Hamlet confronts her with a murderous truth she is terrified to face, she is furious at being snapped out of her self-protective trance for even a second. For a change, there are no suggestions of an incestuous love. As Claudius, Jamey Sheridan, whose medal-encrusted uniform suggests Virginia military gentry, is a suavely beady-eyed fascist and pragmatic authoritarian, at once magnetic and chilling. 
The three-hour film devotes special care to the smaller roles, including the gravediggers and the players, each of whom has a distinctively vivid personality. As portrayed by Michael Imperioli and Marcus Giamatti, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are polar opposites. Mr. Imperioli's Rosencrantz is a stiff, frightened toady to Mr. Giamatti's cool, wily fixer. These small, meticulous touches enrich the film immensely. 
But the movie belongs to Mr. Scott, whose performance so dominates (the many close-ups almost take us inside Hamlet's head) that even more than usual we see the events in a rotting Denmark through his aggrieved eyes. At the same time, the film's American setting and its studious evocation of a formal hierarchy where secrecy and paranoia run rampant remind you that the story isn't just about Denmark way back when. It could be a portrait of any seat of power where authority has been wrested through murder and ruthless suppression.

‽On Hostile Ground‽,‽Directed by Liz Mermin and Jenny Raskin 
Not rated; 73 minutes 
The Hollywood films of the last 20 years have made us think of heroes as otherworldly figures, either absurdly pumped-up caricatures of masculinity (from Russell Crowe in ''Gladiator'' to Arnold Schwarzenegger in anything) or characters, like Julia Roberts's Erin Brockovich, who are so aggressively ordinary that they end by seeming wildly exotic. 
''On Hostile Ground,'' a video documentary produced by Liz Merman, Jenny Raskin and Catherine Gund, goes looking for heroes in the real world and finds three extraordinary individuals who put their lives on the line daily, motivated purely by their commitment to a cause. 
They are two doctors and a physician's assistant who perform abortions in parts of the country where to do so is to attract physically and verbally aggressive protesters, fire-bombers and even assassins. 
They are Richard Stuntz, a 76-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who lives in Baltimore but spends three days a week working in clinics in Alabama; Susan Cahill, a certified physician's assistant whose clinic in Montana was destroyed by an arsonist in 1993; and Morris Wortman, an outspoken gynecologist whose office is in Rochester. 
Abortion may still be legal in these communities, but as the director of a Montgomery, Ala., clinic observes, ''It might as well be illegal'' whre no professionals are willing or able to perform the service. Dr. Stuntz has a bulletproof vest but prefers not to wear it because it affects his pacemaker; instead, he relies on his cell phone to learn which routes are safe to take from the airport to the clinics. 
In the interview sequences, the filmmakers do their best to uncover the motivations of these three everyday risk-takers: Dr. Stuntz, the son of Methodist missionaries, operates from a quiet, self-effacing idealism. Ms. Cahill will venture only that ''providing abortions is part of taking care of families.'' Only the flamboyant Dr. Wortman offers a psychological explanation for his actions: his parents were Holocaust survivors, and he feels the need to take a firm stand in his life. 
While much of the film seems amateurishly shot, it has been edited into a highly professional presentation, one that smoothly intertwines the three stories and builds to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. 
''On Hostile Ground,'' which opens today at the Screening Room (54 Varick Street, TriBeCa), is unabashedly in favor of abortion rights. But the filmmakers do have the grace to include a brief glimpse of one protester in Rochester who appears neither violent nor fanatical. Instead, she seems to be acting from a personal conviction as deep and sincere as that of the film's three protagonists.   DAVE KEHR 
‽
‽All the Pretty Horses‽,‽John Grady Cole, the noble young cowboy played by Matt Damon in ''All the Pretty Horses,'' says that life boils down to a simple choice: ''stick or quit.'' ''How I was is how I am, and all I know is to stick,'' he tells his boon companion, Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas). 
Billy Bob Thornton and Ted Tally, the director and screenwriter, respectively, of this big, slow, western, have certainly stuck close to their source, Cormac McCarthy's beloved National Book Award-winning novel of 1992. Virtually all the dialogue in the movie -- in Spanish, in twangy cowboyese and in the strangely stilted version of English that seems to be the native idiom of the Mexican ruling class -- has been carefully transferred from the pages of the book. 
The details of the story of John Grady's ill-starred romance with a Mexican landowner's daughter have also been reproduced with respectful care. But the movie, for all its prettiness, manages to be shallow and portentous at the same time. The material to which Mr. Thornton and Mr. Tally have been so ardently faithful has betrayed them. The wiser course may have been to quit. 
Mr. McCarthy's admirers cherish ''All the Pretty Horses,'' the first volume in a trilogy that also includes ''The Crossing'' and ''Cities of the Plain,'' for its manly, lyrical prose and its deep thoughts on the relations between man and nature, man and woman, and man and horse. 
The filmmakers have wisely resisted the temptation to incorporate Mr. McCarthy's high literary style into the picture or to seek out its visual equivalent. Unfortunately, the story, shorn of its philosophical pretensions and fancy writing, turns out to be thin and banal. 
''All the Pretty Horses'' looks like a real old-fashioned western and tries to revive sturdy horse-opera themes of love, friendship and righteous violence. But in spite of some thoughtful performances and a handsome sense of scale, the picture is, for the most part, as slick and superficial as a Marlboro advertisement on the back of a glossy magazine. It alludes to the mythology of the American West without engaging it and supplies a series of picturesque landscapes and grandiose gestures utterly lacking in narrative momentum or emotional resonance. 
Even Barry Markowitz's gorgeous cinematography and Marty Stuart's eclectic score work to undermine rather than complement each other. The music, a tasteful blend of mariachi, norteno and western swing (among other things), covers the movie like wall-to-wall carpeting. Once or twice, it would be good to contemplate the vastness of the desert landscape in silence. 
In essence ''All the Pretty Horses'' is a boy's adventure story that has mistaken itself for an epic, and it rattles around in its own ambitions like a child's head in a 10-gallon hat. It's somewhat fitting, then, that the liveliest and most interesting character should be a child, a stripling named Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black), who joins Lacey and John Grady on their trek across the Texas border into Mexico. 
John Grady has been set adrift by his parents' divorce and his mother's inconsiderate sale of the family homestead. Lacey, his best friend, is the designated sidekick, while Blevins, a prepubescent hothead with a foul mouth and a marksman's eye, has stolen his stepfather's horse and, like a manic Huck Finn, lit out for the territories. 
Mr. Black's fine performance, with its combination of boisterousness and vulnerability, gives the movie a touch of humor and unpredictability it sorely needs. When Blevins's mischievous bluster lands him in morally serious trouble, the film finds its only genuine moment of strong feeling. 
In contrast, the grand passion that develops between John Grady and Alejandra (Penelope Cruz), whose father owns the hacienda on which the two vagabonds find work, is like an Archie Comics version of ''A Place in the Sun.'' The lovers exchange smoldering glances as they pass on horseback, and soon enough Alejandra is sneaking into John Grady's quarters for a bit of discreet montage. 
Alejandra's disapproving aunt, who seems to have wandered in from an Edith Wharton telenovela, gets wind of the affair and subjects John Grady to a series of lectures in philosophy (''It is not a matter of right, but a matter of who must say'') before shipping him, along with poor Lacey, off to jail. 
Ms. Cruz and Mr. Damon are certainly a nice-looking pair, but the film's treatment of their characters' relationship is so stylized and detached that no spark of genuine longing ever ignites between them. Poor Ms. Cruz must utter some of the corniest woman-in-love lines this side of ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' and, to put it as kindly as possible, she's no Meryl Streep. Mr. Damon does a bit better, but John Grady's chivalric goodness smothers the streak of bad-boy spontaneity that is his most appealing trait. 
The great westerns of the 1940's and 50's were rich with subtext, full of psychosexual implication and political anxiety. ''All the Pretty Horses,'' which is set in 1949, strips away such complexity. 
Its view of the difference between Texas and Mexico is as schematic as its ideas about men and women. The northern side of the Rio Grande is a place of law and justice, as embodied by a kindly judge (Bruce Dern), who comes to John Grady's aid at the end. The mysterious land south of the border, on the other hand, is ruled by the arbitrary and corrupt exercise of power, represented by a sinister police captain and that meddling aunt. This would be bothersome, or possibly even interesting, if the movie were not so abstract and complacent, if it had a thought, that is, in its pretty little head. 
''All the Pretty Horses'' is rated PG-13. It has some cowboy cussing, a few scenes of violence and some heavy-breathing, but not terribly explicit, bedroom moments. 
‽
‽Cast Away‽,‽WHICH of us, while sitting at the edge of the ocean and gazing toward the horizon, hasn't shivered to imagine being drawn out to sea, getting lost and ending up a tiny forgotten speck in the middle of nowhere, shouting at the sky? As potentially panic-inducing as this vision may be, there's also something alluring about it. It's like standing on the edge of a cliff and imagining that fatal leap into the unknown. And in the heart-stopping ocean and desert-island scenes that constitute the core of ''Cast Away,'' Tom Hanks, in collaboration with the director Robert Zemeckis and the screenwriter William Broyles Jr., bring those visions thrillingly and hauntingly to life. 
With a bravura mastery of tone and timing, ''Cast Away'' sweeps us out to sea and washes us ashore on a tiny deserted island in the Pacific. We remain stranded there just long enough to be given a deep, salty gulp of what it's like to have to restart civilization from scratch. Just in time for dinner, however, we're whisked back to safety and to tables piled high with supermarket goodies and a life that oddly and sadly seems banal and superfluous compared to what has gone before. 
When ''Cast Away'' is the farthest from civilization, it is as compelling a cinematic adventure as any Hollywood has produced. Back on the mainland, however, it turns more formulaic and corny. But even in the wobbly narrative bookends that hold a love story, interrupted by disaster, there are flashes of a deeper metaphysical poignancy. At its best, ''Cast Away,'' like ''Titanic,'' awes us with its sheer oceanic sweep and its cosmic apprehension of human insignificance. 
The center of the film is an unforgettably gripping, heart-in-your-throat evocation of the unbearable loneliness and terror of ultimate abandonment once its hero, stranded and presumed dead, gives up hope of being rescued but still clings tenaciously to life. 
In one of the script's pointed paradoxes, this modern-day Robinson Crusoe, Chuck Noland (Mr. Hanks), is a voluble, time-obsessed efficiency expert for Federal Express. Shortly before boarding a plane that plunges him into the Pacific, he and his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), exchange gifts: an engagement ring from Chuck, her grandfather's pocket watch (with her picture inside) from Kelly. Marooned with only the timepiece to remind him of home, Chuck finds himself facing only one deadline, the race to survive in the face of  starvation, dehydration and natural disaster. 
''Cast Away'' is everything this year's other man-against-nature blockbuster, ''The Perfect Storm,'' was not. The earlier film huffed and puffed to evoke a similarly elemental struggle in the traditional Hollywood ways, with strenuously grandiose music and oversize, patently unrealistic computer-generated special effects. ''Cast Away'' also has its quotient of technological trickery, but one of the movie's wonders is that everything looks and feels so remarkably real. And it never pushes us too hard. 
It also knows when to turn down the volume. The most devastating sequences, instead of flooding us with music, suspend the soundtrack and forgo even language to allow the sounds of nature to take over. All we hear from Mr. Hanks are the grunts and howls of a man exerting himself to stay alive against a backdrop of the roaring ocean and the wind eerily whistling outside the cave Chuck adopts as a shelter. Ultimate isolation, the movie reminds us, doesn't have a soundtrack except what the environment churns up along with the ringing in our ears, our heartbeats and the voices chattering in our minds. 
Once again, Mr. Hanks portrays a spirited Everyman, at once deeply likable and profoundly ordinary. If his wound-up, globe-trotting character, who early in the film is shown haranguing Russian employees at a FedEx depot in Moscow, isn't exactly like you and me in his background and tastes (he happens to be an Elvis Presley fanatic), he embodies enough parts of other people to be utterly recognizable. 
Mr. Hanks's likability has everything to do with the ease with which he pours the childlike side of himself into his performances. Even at moments of maximum stress, the qualities that shine through are an infectious spontaneity, curiosity, ebullience and native optimism, along with an instinctive common-sense resourcefulness. 
The screenplay's conceptual master stroke has Chuck revert to childhood through the creation of an imaginary companion so he can survive psychically. Painting a face (in his own blood) on a white Wilson volleyball extracted from a FedEx package that washes up on shore, he turns Wilson (as he calls the ball) into a fellow survivor, confidant and collaborator in an escape plan. Anyone who recalls being a very young child and clutching a doll that embodies comfort and companionship in times of loneliness and insecurity will relate to the wrenching scenes in which Chuck clings to Wilson for emotional support. 
The volleyball is one of many practical uses Chuck is able to make from the washed-up items (many of them Christmas presents) in FedEx packages that at first seem useless but become essential survival tools. A pair of figure skates becomes both a knife and a tool for removing an infected tooth in an excruciating scene of do-it-yourself dentistry. Videotapes become ropes for an escape raft, and the netting in a fancy dress a fishing net. 
''Cast Away'' doesn't begin working its spell until its introductory scenes of its harried hero and his fiancee are out of the way. But once Chuck is aboard a FedEx plane flying over the Pacific, an escalating sense of dread takes over as the aircraft gives a warning shudder. 
What follows is the scariest, most believable plane crash ever filmed as the aircraft begins splitting apart and plummets in a whirling, vertiginous roar amid a violent thunderstorm. It is so real you can almost feel the metal body of the aircraft shaking violently as it is wrenched apart. Crashing into the ocean, Chuck is plunged underwater, his life-preserver narrowly avoiding puncture by a shard on which it is momentarily caught. Rising to the surface, he finds himself surrounded by pieces of the burning aircraft illuminating utter blackness in a furious storm. 
Once Chuck, close to exhaustion, has drifted onto the shore of a tiny tropical island, the movie makes each lesson in survival -- from pounding open a coconut to building a fire from scratch to a first frustrated attempt at an escape -- an agonizing, often bloody, sometimes life-threatening ritual. The world in which he finds himself, a pristine island amid a turquoise sea, is as dazzlingly  beautiful as it is treacherous. 
Finally, after a certain point, the movie fades out and a title informs that four years have passed. In the intervening years, Chuck has metamorphosed into a gaunt, shaggy, nut-brown survivalist, camped in a lair embellished with his own cave drawings. Mr. Hanks lost more than 50 pounds for this section of the film (Mr. Zemeckis completed ''What Lies Beneath'' in the interim), and the actor's physical transformation is as startling (and dramatically effective) as the fattened-up Robert De Niro in the later scenes of ''Raging Bull.'' 
Ultimately ''Cast Away'' has to end somewhere. And because it's a Hollywood movie with an attenuated love story it needs to resolve, it couldn't disintegrate into nothingness. Once Chuck is saved, he appears terminally detached and wears the faraway expression of a man whose traumatic experience has separated him from others. For the rest of his life, we sense, an essential part of him will still be living alone on that island. 
At the same time, Mr. Hanks radiates the inappropriately sleek glow of someone who has just returned from a luxury spa. And though his scenes with Ms. Hunt are well acted (the two really are perfectly matched as a decent Mr. and Ms. American Everyperson), the suds are too thick to be washed away. 
But in these later scenes, the movie also plays with metaphysical uncertainty in effective, recurrent images of an actual crossroads. Because the conflict between romantic convention and the movie's angst is never resolved, ''Cast Away'' leaves us hanging. But that final, lurking ambiguity is a small price to pay for the primal force of what has come before. 
''Cast Away'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

‽The Family Man‽,‽It seems that every few years the studios release movies that seek to offer Christmas magic but end up feeling forlorn and empty. One was ''Trapped in Paradise'' (1994), which starred Nicolas Cage as a former thief trying to reform who ends up trapped in a winter wonderland of a small town with his no-good brothers. That tradition continues: this year the always hard-working Mr. Cage is marooned in a snow-globe fantasyland in ''The Family Man,'' a piece of moldy wax fruit if ever there was one. A few years ago The New Yorker ran a cartoon with the caption ''Donna Karan's Biggest Nightmare''; the drawing featured someone wearing a sweatshirt with DKNJ scrawled across the chest. 
That could be the theme of ''The Family Man,'' in which Mr. Cage as Jack, a man about Manhattan, is pulled out of his world of creature comforts and hurled across the Hudson River into another life and another world. Jack lives like royalty in New York City. He has more Zegna suits in his closets than the designer's Fifth Avenue store carries. He pilots a Ferrari through the streets of Manhattan without ever seeming to hit a red light. Plus he manages to get valet service at his office building: proof positive that he leads a charmed life. 
His life is empty, though. At Christmastime he thinks fondly back to the woman he loved and left behind in 1987. ''I took the road less traveled,'' he says dreamily to his assistant (Mary Beth Hurt). Then he intervenes in a grocery store robbery, and after talking the would-be hold-up man (Don Cheadle) out of a violent act, Jack mentions to him that he has everything. It takes the rest of ''The Family Man'' for him to learn that he doesn't. 
He is magically given a suburban existence by Mr. Cheadle, complete with a temperamental minivan and a wife -- Kate (Tea Leoni), the woman he chose not to return to years earlier -- and two children to go with it. The commercials for the movie play the Talking Heads song ''Once in a Lifetime,'' and you can see the song's lyrics going through Jack's head: this is not my beautiful wife, this is not my beautiful car, this is not my father's Oldsmobile. (It also leaves elements hanging, like Mr. Cheadle's robber, who ends up transforming Jack's life. Taking Clarence the angel from ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and making him a black man with a handgun isn't going to make this movie any more chic.) 
Despite its lumpy cheerlessness, ''The Family Man'' squeezes out a few laughs. Mr. Cage manages to be contemptuous and bewildered at the same time in a performance that's a marvel of modesty. (In a scene in which the well-meaning Kate buys him a knockoff Zegna suit, the millisecond of horror is priceless.) In his new life, Jack is like an emperor without a royal taster, and he can't believe the cluttered, child-friendly house he lives in or the badly fitting clothes or his job. (He manages his father-in-law's tire store.) This holiday season high concept -- a fish out of water under the mistletoe -- is tired but as sturdily engineered as a Volvo. Even though he was a perfectly charming guy with a kind word for everyone when he had it all, Jack has to learn to be unselfish. 
The director, Brett Ratner, is extremely savvy at the opposites-attract buddy comedy, as he proved with ''Money Talks'' and the phenomenal hit ''Rush Hour.'' He is good at using an outsider for laughs, though this film's life-is-fuller-at-the-mall concept is patronizing. Mr. Ratner has pushed his directing up a notch. Despite the cheap jokes, he stages the picture with some sophistication. This is his shift away from action comedy, and he is much more assured here with this tired plot. 
Mr. Ratner can let his actors play things closer to the vest -- they're less harried, with no imminent fireballs behind them -- with the confidence that he can still bring the audience along with him. He made a wise choice in casting Ms. Leoni as Kate. She harvests a world of exasperation out of her responses to Jack's whining, using her cracked, whiskey-sour voice as a foil. It's a small wonder that Jack and Kate's voices become a tiny symphony of complaints; she acts as if she really has been listening to Jack for 13 years. 
In the days before he became highfalutin and said he took the surname Cage as a tribute to the avant-garde composer John Cage, the actor admitted that his last name was a tribute to the comics hero Luke Cage, hero for hire, a blaxploitation-type superhero who wore a yellow silk shirt, black leather pants and a chain as a belt. And in his early days as a performer Nicolas Cage was just such a high-wire act, a hero for hire who was fearless in his utter lack of cynicism, an actor so compelled to express a rollicking inner life that you got the feeling directors didn't know where to look when they were filming him. 
Then he wanted to unleash his soul while the lens was on him; now, with those baleful eyes, he is Huckleberry Hound with a Marin County drawl instead of a down-South accent, and he elongates the words, giving a sardonic performance in which he comments to himself on his new life. 
He is no longer wrestling with himself as an actor; here, his heroism comes from the reined-in precision. His instincts have given way to technique, with every gesture scaled down for the screen. Mr. Cage is a specialist in a unique genre -- the living nightmare comedy -- even though he is no longer as grand an actor. He probably doesn't need to be, but I miss the guy who found pleasure in taking hairpin curves at 180 miles an hour. The Nicolas Cage of 1987 would have run Jack's Ferrari into an underpass. 
He is still unpredictable, even in a movie like ''The Family Man,'' which seems to have been assembled from a kit. Here the star is in a tough position because in each of his existences he thinks the snow is whiter on the other side. There is something missing from his life as a wealthy, driven capitalist, but when he's shoved into a Garden State suburban life, scrambling to make the mortgage payments, he's miserable, too. 
He is probably the only person in theaters running ''The Family Man'' who doesn't realize there may be a clock ticking on his ideal middle-class life. The gift for the man who has everything is nothing, the magic of taking away, and like Jack, ''The Family Man'' doesn't seem to know what it wants for Christmas, which doesn't make for a very satisfying movie. 
There used to be a time when moviemakers didn't ask their audiences to feel pity for the rich; they made fun of them. But in the days of 30's screwball comedy, the plutocrats knew what they had. Even as recently as ''Arthur'' in 1981, probably the last great wealthy-guy comedy, when the multimillionaire Arthur was asked how it felt to have all that money, he smiled and said, ''It feels great.'' 
''The Family Man'' asks us to feel sorry for Mr. Cage's character both when he is rich and when he is part of the middle class, probably because it wants to evoke the same kind of suffering as ''It's a Wonderul Life'' and the film version of ''A Christmas Carol.'' But ''A Christmas Carol'' has always been oversimplified for the screen, and ''Wonderful Life'' is really just a combination of ''A Christmas Carol'' and Jules Romains's novel ''Mort de Quelqu'un,'' in which the suicide of an insignificant common man sends shock waves throughout society. In those stories, there was righteous anger. ''The Family Man'' wants us to feel Jack's pain, but it's a panhandler in a $2,500 suit. 
''The Family Man'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has adult language, mild violence and intense situations.

‽Miss Congeniality‽,‽Midway through ''Miss Congeniality,'' Special Agent Gracie Hart of the F.B.I. (Sandra Bullock) baits her co-worker Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) with a sing-song schoolyard taunt: ''You want to kiss me. You want to hug me. You want to love me.'' 
This might summarize Ms. Bullock's curious relationship with her audience. We do want to love her, but she doesn't always make it easy. Her appeal is paradoxical: the more aggressively she flaunts her awkward, abrasive qualities, the more winning she is. And, conversely, whenever she sheds her ugly-duckling feathers, she sloughs off much of her charm. 
''Miss Congeniality,'' to mix zoological metaphors, is a standard-issue fish-out-of-water comedy, with Ms. Bullock as the fish. Gracie, slovenly, career-obsessed and barely socialized, has been placed on desk duty after botching an undercover assignment involving Russian mobsters, who have become Hollywood's acceptable ethnic bad guys of the moment. Before long, an enigmatic terrorist known as the Citizen announces by cryptic fax that he plans to disrupt the Miss United States pageant. A computerized paper-doll simulation shows Gracie to be the only agent in the bureau who looks good enough in a bathing suit to pass as one of the contestants. 
The problem of course is that in spite of her name, she's spectacularly graceless, utterly lacking in the poised femininity that the pageant celebrates. Luckily, Michael Caine is on hand in the role of Victor Melling, a disgraced beauty consultant who is hired as a taxpayer-financed Pygmalion. 
Mr. Caine, who performed a similar service for Julie Walters in the melodrama ''Educating Rita'' some years ago, gives one of his brisk, understated character performances. He infuses the part with a hint of pathos -- here is an aging man who has devoted his life to the cause of female beauty -- and adds a saving touch of lechery (directed not at Gracie, whom he finds unbearably vulgar, but at the handsome Agent Matthews). In the film's funniest sequence, Melling oversees a heroic government-supervised makeover, performed in an empty airplane hangar by a crack team of hairdressers, make-up daubers and experts in the art of depilation. 
A few other supporting performances add comic spark to a movie that otherwise seems happily, deliberately second-rate, as if its ideal audience consisted of weary airline passengers. (It's the kind of movie that would seem like a pleasant surprise in a cramped coach at 35,000 feet.) 
Candice Bergen is on hand as the pageant's organizer, a woman so brittle and tightly wound that a vigorous sneeze might snap off her nose. Her life, she tells Gracie, has become a crusade against ''feminists, intellectuals and ugly women'': epithets she seems to think apply especially well to undercover F.B.I. agents. William Shatner, relishing his newfound career as an icon of self-parody, has too few scenes as the contest's woozy host. 
The picture runs its course smoothly enough, with a few amusing scenes and a whodunit plot that's mildly suspenseful, provided you don't pay very close attention. But these days it seems no Hollywood comedy, however silly, can roll off the assembly line unless a heartfelt message about personal growth and self-discovery has been sprayed over it like rustproofing on a new car. By impersonating Miss New Jersey, Gracie discovers in herself the womanliness she had hitherto suppressed. 
In her final speech at the pageant, she pays earnest tribute to the valiant women she (and the movie) previously mocked as bimbos and airheads. And of course once the tomcatting Agent Matthews catches sight of her in her clingy gowns and tasteful swimwear, he wants to love her and kiss her and hug her. And why not? She embodies this year's movie ideal of womanhood: a martial arts expert who looks fabulous in tight clothes and keeps a .45 strapped to her thigh. 
The appeal of this fantasy, to men and women alike, is clear enough, though the version offered by ''Miss Congeniality'' pales beside the candy-colored mayhem of ''Charlie's Angels,'' the elegance of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' or the integrity of the unjustly neglected ''Girlfight.'' 
''Miss Congeniality'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some risque situations and mild profanity.

‽But Forever in My Mind‽,‽''But Forever in My Mind'' begins with a quotation from Abbie Hoffman and an audio tour of events from the Vietnam War to the fall of the Berlin Wall, with special emphasis, since the movie takes place in Rome, on Italy's rich history of political turmoil. 
The present-day 16-year-olds who populate Gabriele Muccino's new film, which opens today at the Film Forum, live in the shadow of bygone radicalism. When the students occupy their school, ostensibly to protest standardization and privatization -- words they pronounce with venomous conviction, even if it's not clear that they know what they're talking about -- they seem to be acting out a ritual of adolescence rather than taking a political stand. Indeed, the occupation is an annual event, like the senior prom, but with militant chanting, hand-lettered banners and an obligatory appearance by the police. 
Despite all the talk about struggling against reactionaries and the bourgeoisie, the social ecology of the Italian high school depicted in ''But Forever in My Mind'' will be familiar to viewers of after-school specials on American television. At one point Silvio (Silvio Muccino), a young man whose romantic and domestic troubles are the movie's main concern, provides a field guide to Roman teenagers, who divide themselves into fascists, alternatives, preppies and B-boys, distinctions based mostly on styles of dress. 
Silvio, whose parents are onetime student revolutionaries who have clearly made peace with bourgeois life, is desperate for love and sexual experience. In the heady chaos of the school takeover, he has a brief encounter with Valentina (Giulia Carmignani), provoking the jealousy of his friend Martino (Simone Pagani). After a series of comic misunderstandings and melodramatic confrontations with his bewildered parents, Silvio ends up with Claudia (Giulia Steigerwalt), who has been quietly carrying a torch for him for six months. 
Through most of these doings, ''But Forever in My Mind'' sustains a frenetic momentum. But even for a teenage romantic comedy and in spite of the political polemics, the stakes seem very low. The anguish of adolescence arises from trouble that is often objectively trivial but that feels like life and death when you're going through it. Mr. Muccino and his cast don't quite find the balance between poking fun at Silvio and his friends and honoring their feelings and ideals. Silvio himself comes across as too selfish and spoiled to deserve our sympathy or Claudia's devotion, and his friends, other than the jealous Martino, never emerge as distinct characters. Aiming for lighthearted, bittersweet charm, ''But Forever in My Mind'' slips into predictability and condescension. 
BUT FOREVER IN MY MIND 
Directed by Gabriele Muccino; written (in Italian, with English subtitles) by Mr. Muccino with the collaboration of Silvio Muccino and Adele Tulli and based on an idea of Marco Valerio Fusco; director of photography, Arnaldo Catinari; edited by Claudio Di Mauro; music by Paolo Buonvino; production designer, Eugenia F. di Napoli; produced by Domenico Procacci; released by Intra Films.

‽Dude, Where's My Car?‽,‽''Dude, Where's My Car?'' is a surprisingly sweet, mild-mannered movie for a teenage comedy spoof, and that's not a good thing. Yes, the film, which opened yesterday, has its gross-out moments (urination in a fish tank), its adolescent sexual obsessiveness (the same old breast fetish) and its druggy humor (a dog gets stoned on pot). But the mad excesses and gleeful tastelessness of a genre that calls to what remains of the dirty-minded brat in all of us are largely missing from this cheery post-''Wayne's World'' stew of teenage buddy jokes and low-rent sci-fi nonsense. 
It all begins the morning Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and his roommate Chester (Seann William Scott), a pair of pizza deliverers, wake up to find their refrigerator and cupboards crammed with a year's supply of pudding but can't remember how it got there or what they did the night before. The bad news accumulates. In addition to learning that they trashed the cottage of their twin girlfriends, Wanda (Jennifer Garner) and Wilma (Marla Sokoloff), they lost their car. 
Using clues (like matchbook covers), they retrace their steps to a strip club where Jesse is tempted by an irate transsexual stripper who demands the return of $200,000 Jesse has no recollection of having taken from her. They also find themselves  pursued by competing sects of extraterrestrials in search of a ''continuum transfunctioner'' that has the power to destroy the universe. 
Whom should they trust? The Nordic Dudes (a pair of Schwarzenegger clones)? A sect of space nerds outfitted in bubble wrap jumpsuits? Or the grimly sexy Hot Chicks, a troupe of sleek, buxom space babes who proffer erotic pleasure as a reward? The movie, directed by Danny Leiner from a screenplay by Philip Stark, is so flighty and disconnected that it barely bothers to answer that question. 
Although the movie has some promising comic setups (the best is a silly sequence in which our boys are surrounded and attacked by a group of ostriches), it is too lazy to bother following through. Even when it flirts with being offensive in a scene of blind children playing baseball, it has neither the wit nor the attention span to make anything of it. 
Mr. Kutcher and Mr. Scott exude an innocuous charm as sidekicks, but compared with Wayne and Garth or Cheech and Chong, or practically any other comedic teams you could name, they are strictly lightweight. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mildly off-color humor.

‽
‽What Women Want‽,‽''What Women Want'' starts with a great idea, but the movie's potential drops faster than the tech stocks on the Nasdaq. Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a cool-cat Chicago advertising executive with the Strip in his blood. His mother was a showgirl and raised him like a Vegas princeling. Now he prowls the streets of Chicago with a sexist joke at the ready, just like the cigarette that perches in the corner of his mouth. Nick is an unrepentant chauvinist: ''a man's man who doesn't get what women are all about,'' sighs his ex-wife, Gigi (Lauren Holly). His teenage daughter, Alex (well played by Ashley Johnson), thinks he's a jerk. 
Things change when Nick accidentally receives an electric shock in a bathroom blow drier accident and finds he can read women's minds. (''The kind of thing that happens all the time,'' Mr. Gibson joked in a recent appearance on David Letterman's show.) ''What Women Want'' is most amusing in the first 20 minutes, before Mr. Gibson has to find his inner sensitivity, and the picture becomes ''Tootsie'' for the slow-witted. 
Mr. Gibson plays Nick with a Rat Pack bounce, and without a leer. A man without complications, Nick revels in his shallowness and is genuinely happy bouncing from chick to chick. With his boys' toys, including a lustrous Breguet chronograph wristwatch and up-to-the-minute fashions (well, if the movie were set in 1992), he is what used to be called the Man Who Reads Playboy. 
Just before his accident gives him gender-specific telepathy, Nick loses a promotion because a woman, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), is brought in over him. His Cro Magnon masculinity no longer sells products, his boss (Alan Alda) tells him. It's up to Darcy to make changes and go after the female market that the agency has missed out on. ''I gotta think like a broad,'' Nick says, knitting his brow. 
As directed by Nancy Meyers, Nick isn't a character, really: he's a conceit, the kind of ring-a-ding 60's swingle that Tony Franciosa used to play after he decided to give up acting for a stretch and keep his grinning charm on high idle. The guy's- guy archetype that Nick represents was played by Nick Nolte in ''I Love Trouble,'' written by Ms. Meyers and her former partner, Charles Shyer. (''What Women Want'' is even set in Chicago, as was ''I Love Trouble.'') 
After Nick becomes a conduit for women's thoughts, he's doesn't exactly use his powers for the good of humanity -- not initially, anyway. In this shift, Ms. Meyers makes good use of music: Bobby Darin's ''Mack the Knife'' goes from setting the tone for Nick's stylishness to becoming an apt description of the way he plunders women's minds. The musical motifs put the picture across in a few scenes, as when Nick rifles through Alex's backpack looking for CD's to help put him in a more feminine frame of mind. (She seems a little young to be listening to Meredith Brooks and Alanis Morrisette, though.) 
Mr. Gibson shines for a good chunk of ''What Women Want.'' He's like Lee Marvin with a deeper range; he registers hurt when the thoughts of Nick's female co-workers pour into his hard head and he realizes what a dog they think he is. Mr. Gibson has often squeezed a bit of romantic comedy into even his sweatiest action roles, like his self-deprecating courtship scenes in ''Lethal Weapon 2,'' of all things. 
He hasn't had many chances to play full-blown romance since ''The Year of Living Dangerously,'' and he obviously digs not having to slam a clip into a handgun. You can hear the comfort level in his baritone; he's a man who knows how to use his voice to get what he wants, and like all brats, he assumes everyone else wants what he wants. 
''What Women Want'' is an update of the Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedies except, unlike those Ross Hunter productions, no one here has bothered to write a leading female character strong enough to pit against the male lead. It's not enough that Mr. Gibson is playing against type. Ms. Hunt gets all she can out of her chin-up querulousness, but like all the women in ''What Women Want,'' she's nice despite her reputation as a tough dart. 
It's this lack of definition that seems truly negligent; it seems that what women want is to show that they're all sweethearts. If the movie had the courage to show that women are complex people, it would be a much more inspired picture. Instead, it feels anachronistic and lifted from other movies, dawdling as it arrives at the inevitable conclusion that listening to women makes Nick a better man. 
Before it settles for sentimentality, the film occasionally clicks. As Lola, a damaged-goods actress working in a coffee shop, Marisa Tomei does some of her best work in years. Her date with Nick, who can't quite deal with the conflicting thoughts he is reading, is marvelously funny. The neuroses bounce across the screen, and Ms. Tomei is incredibly sexy when she's bored by his cockiness. 
The rest of ''What Women Want'' feels out of touch. Nick's steak-and-Scotch persona is now back in vogue in the ad world, which makes the listen-to-your-inner-voice Nike commercial Nick and Darcy put together seem like an artifact from the Jurassic Park Gift Shop. 
''What Women Want'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). it has strong language, sexuality and alcohol and drug use.

‽
‽The Emperor's New Groove‽,‽''The Emperor's New Groove'' is a timely reminder that animated films don't have to be grandiose visual circuses with full Broadway scores to entertain. 
Not even the parting of the Red Sea can substitute for a sprightly sense of humor and sharply etched cartoon characters swapping wisecracks and doing pratfalls. 
On the surface, Disney's newest animated film looks and sounds like a poor second cousin to Dreamworks's far more splendiferous (but dreary) ''Road to El Dorado.'' But once it hits its groove, so to speak, the new movie exhibits a cheeky effervescence and spunk that were conspicuously absent in its glittering dud of a predecessor. 
The obvious resemblances between the two begin with their pseudo-ancient settings. Where ''The Road to El Dorado'' evoked a gilded Disneyland version of the Mayan empire, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' paints a much less glamorous Saturday morning cartoon version of the Incas in Peru. Their monarch, Kuzco (David Spade), is a glib, sarcastic, monstrously selfish teenager who thinks nothing of having his subjects thrown out the window should they accidentally interfere with his upbeat ''groove.'' Both movies also involve a struggle for the crown and feature characters trading comic banter as they trek through the jungle. 
As the story begins, Kuzco is a happy little despot who is so self-involved that he fails to notice that his chief adviser, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), an ancient, embittered diva, hates his guts and is scheming for his downfall. Aided by her personal assistant, Kronk (Patrick Warburton), a stupid, muscle-bound oaf, Yzma tries to poison Kuzco, but the deadly potion succeeds only in turning him into a llama, which Kronk throws out of the castle. 
Lost in the jungle, Kuzco teams up with Pacha (John Goodman), a kindly peasant who helps him even though Kuzco once threatened to turn Pacha's mountain village into a private resort and send all the residents packing. The movie turns into a standard fable of initiation and growing up in which Kuzco learns enough about friendship and trust in his llama incarnation to acquire some humanity before his restoration to his old self and imperial rank. 
''The Emperor's New Groove,'' directed by Mark Dindal, shrewdly avoids pompous moralizing in favor of zany high jinks and snide, adolescent jokes, which Mr. Spade delivers with a typically smug twerpiness that suits the role just fine. David Reynolds's screenplay is particularly nasty toward old folks. Yzma is the butt of endless jokes about what a frightful old hag she is. 
When she learns that Kuzco is still alive, she and Kronk go looking for him with murder in their hearts. 
While visiting Pacha's family and claiming to be the emperor's great-aunt, Yzma is secretly mocked by  Pacha's children, who snicker that she looks too old to be merely a great-aunt. She must be a ''great-great-great-great-great-aunt,'' they insist. 
The movie has an abundance of clever acrobatic sight gags and giddy nonsense. During a farcical chase in a roadside restaurant, Kronk turns into a chef dishing out his speciality, spinach puffs, as doors slam open and shut. The final struggle for the magic potion that can transform Kuzco from a llama back into a human is an acrobatic free-for-all in which Kuzco and Yzma (who drinks from the wrong bottle and turns into a cat) compete to pounce on the elusive vial. 
Even the movie's lessons in cooperation have a springy touch. Twice, the squabbling Pacha and Kuzco are forced to save themselves from plunging into an abyss by shimmying back-to-back up opposing rock faces. 
If ''The Emperor's New Groove'' ultimately doesn't amount to much, its brand of mindless fun is easier to like than the morally freighted humor of many more expensive animated films that take their allegorical pretensions far too seriously.

‽Strippers‽,‽Directed by Jorge Ameer 
Not rated; 75 minutes 
Jorge Ameer's ''Strippers'' belongs to that vast cinematic underbelly of semiprofessional made-for-video movies that for reasons known only to God are lucky enough to enjoy a thoroughly undeserved theatrical release. Soft-core cinephiles be warned: the title is a misleading come-on. ''Strippers'' isn't about stripteasers but about  evil sharks, from rapaciously materialistic girlfriends and duplicitous business managers to unsympathetic financial institutions, that take pleasure in ''stripping'' an innocent guy of his wealth. 
The cheesy, amateurish film follows the precipitous downfall of Alan Gardner (Tony Tucci), an advertising executive who, in the space of a few days, loses his job, his girlfriend, his apartment and his income, is brutally beaten and ultimately dies of his injuries. The bizarre performances belong strictly to the ''read the cue cards and emote like crazy'' school of acting. 
The filmmaker himself appears as Kevin, the best friend of this unfortunate yuppie Job. Kevin is an entrepreneurial weirdo who comes up with the notion of a line of products whose colors are identified in commercials by the slang words for bodily fluids and excretions. Trust me: it's not funny.   STEPHEN HOLDEN 
‽
‽Proof of Life‽,‽Taylor Hackford's cold, savvy political thriller, ''Proof of Life,'' proves at least one thing. If Hollywood were to remake ''Casablanca'' (and let's fervently hope it has no such plans), Russell Crowe should be on the short list of candidates to play Rick. Although the new movie borrows elements (including a dramatic airport finale) from that World War II classic, it is more like a distant (and hollow) echo than a contemporary remake of the original. 
Set in present-day South America in the fictional country of Tecala (Latin America's second-ranking producer of cocaine after Colombia, we are told), ''Proof of Life'' cannily appropriates aspects of ''Casablanca'' for dramatic ballast. But the allusions ultimately backfire, because they only underscore a gaping lack of emotional connection among the characters in a romantic triangle that feels conspicuously unromantic. 
What ultimately sinks this stylish but heartless film is a flat lead performance by the eternally snippy Meg Ryan. Playing a corporate wife attracted to the hostage negotiator (Mr. Crowe) who is bargaining for her husband's life after he is kidnapped and held for ransom, Ms. Ryan expresses no inner conflict, nor much of anything else beyond a mounting tension. Even when her wide blue eyes well up with tears, the pain she conveys is more the frustration of a little girl who has misplaced her doll than any deep, empathetic suffering. 
Everything that's wrong with Ms. Ryan's performance is distilled in her trademark gesture of fingering her lower lip and going into an alluring pout. It may look cute, but it's dramatically false. 
When we first meet Ms. Ryan's character, Alice Bowman, she and her husband, Peter (David Morse), an American engineer supervising the building of a dam in Tecala, are bickering. The couple have traipsed all over the world, from Thailand to Africa (where Alice had a miscarriage) to South America, where they live in what was once a drug lord's splendid hacienda, bought at a fire sale price. Although Peter calls Alice a hippie, she is obviously fed up with all their traveling and ready to return to the United States to build a bland bourgeois nest. 
In the movie's early scenes, the queasy feeling that these two don't even like each other is so palpable it leaves a residue of sourness that extends through the rest of the film. Although Alice becomes extremely distressed after a rebel group kidnaps Peter and holds him hostage in a mountain retreat, her anguish doesn't really track after the nastiness we witnessed at the beginning. 
Enter Terry Thorne (Mr. Crowe), an Australian-born, London-based professional negotiator hired by corporations to bargain with kidnappers in high-profile cases. Terry, who has just wrapped up a ticklish assignment in Chechnya, flies to Tecala, where he shocks Alice with his hard-nosed advice about the dos and don'ts of bargaining. It's all about money and only about money, he explains. Bringing the ransom price down is a nerve-racking waiting game that can be won only by exercising the cool deliberation of a high-stakes poker player. 
Just as Terry is about to begin negotiating, he learns that the corporate insurance covering Peter's ransom has lapsed, and he abruptly returns to London. Once there, however, he realizes that Peter doesn't stand a chance without his help, and he returns just in time to snatch the negotiations from the hands of an unscrupulous, gun-toting local ''coordinator.'' 
This change of heart, or crisis of conscience, or whatever it is, is never satisfactorily explained. Might Terry have fallen for Alice when they first met? There are no indications to suggest he did. Having taken over the case, he scoffs at the kidnappers' initial demand of $3 million and insists on holding out for a paltry $600,000. 
But when another prisoner, a French Foreign Legion member, escapes from the rebels' hideaway with a map revealing Peter's whereabouts, Terry teams up with a fellow negotiator, Dino (David Caruso), and some mercenaries for a rescue operation, which they carry out with the exuberance of rampaging cowboys. 
''Proof of Life,'' which was inspired by William Prochnau's Vanity Fair article ''Adventures in the Ransom Trade'' and the book ''Long March to Freedom'' by Thomas Hargrove, is much better dealing with the business of kidnapping than with the attendant emotions. 
In its cynical (and convincing) worldview, money rules everything. The film is as contemptuous of the rapacious and deceitful Texan oil executives who have put Peter's company out of business as it is of the rebel kidnappers, a band of Marxist revolutionaries so thoroughly corrupted by their drug and kidnapping operations that they now spend much of their time getting high. The movie's scornful appraisal of American diplomats in Tecala sees them as slavishly beholden to the oil companies (which plan to run a pipeline into the area) and too powerless to offer Alice anything except official ''sympathy.'' 
Terry is the one beacon of integrity in this slithering mass of corruption and self-interest. And as he did in ''Gladiator,'' Mr. Crowe radiates a stubborn, heroic solidity. If his performance is a bit too self-contained (Terry's feeling for Alice is expressed only once, in a spontaneous, but carefully tender kiss), his effortless charisma is still sufficient to give the film a center of gravity. 
Were Mr. Crowe ever to play Rick in ''Casablanca,'' instead of Humphrey Bogart's hard-boiled wounded romantic, he would probably give him the mournful shambling aura of a loyal St. Bernard with a distant glimmer of fire in his eyes. Although that movie should never be made, one thing is certain: Mr. Crowe's performance would be something to watch. 
''Proof of Life'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of profanity and scenes of violence.

‽Vertical Limit‽,‽The director Martin Campbell knows what his competition is for ''Vertical Limit,'' a shallow yet empty action extravaganza set on the notorious Himalayan peak K2. It's the ''Cliffhanger'' trailer, which neatly jettisoned the (heh, heh) plot and shoehorned in every heart-stopping leap and explosion that took place in the blissful, snowcapped setting, where even sub-arctic temperatures couldn't keep Sylvester Stallone from wearing T-shirts. (The trailer is the best picture Renny Harlin ever made.) 
This time, it's Chris O'Donnell against the mountain. He plays Peter Garrett, a former mountaineer scaling K2 to save his sister, Annie (Robin Tunney), who is trapped with her fellow climbers in an icy crevasse that looks as if it were made of Tide. The height and the temperature are sure to kill them -- that is, if merciless winds and Annie's employer, the survive-at-all-costs entrepreneur Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton), don't do them in first. 
''Vertical Limit'' starts with a sequence that sets up the schisms between Peter and Annie, as well as Peter's reluctance to climb again. In this section, a pleasure climb that morphs into a nightmare version of a Mountain Dew commercial, Mr. Campbell shows the same breezy brio that he displayed in the opening of ''Goldeneye.'' Both demonstrated his talent for exposing human quirks in the middle of two-fisted choreography. This initial tease of a scene shows more class and thought than the rest of the movie, which lumbers from lardy exposition to climax overload. 
After the opening, ''Vertical Limit'' leaps three years ahead. Peter is now a photographer shooting in the Himalayas. Annie is there with the excessive and crudely manipulative Vaughn, who wants to use their expedition to publicize a new business venture. Vaughn has tried the climb before; someone notes, ''As you know, that attempt ended in tragedy.'' (Apparently, the oxygen is so thin at that height that even the ability to come up with competent dialogue is threatened.) The Vaughn base camp looks like a parking lot party at a Phish concert. 
When Annie and her group are lost, Peter volunteers to help, despite his issues. He is joined by Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), who is much tougher than his name would suggest. An ornery cuss, Wick is weathered enough to look as if he has spent the last 20 years sleeping on a mountain face, and when he gets ready to join Peter on the trip, he shaves his long beard with a blade and no water.  The aging Mr. Glenn looks like David Carradine, and his lines make him sound like a deranged version of Mr. Carradine's Caine from ''Kung Fu.'' 
''Vertical Limit'' is like an enabler for Mr. Campbell's action addiction.  The picture includes so many explosions on the mountain that you may leave the theater wondering why any of the Himalayas are still standing; the director begins to seem as cold and manipulative as Vaughn. The film gives lip service to Pakistani politics -- a brief mix of the book ''Into Thin Air'' and the old movie ''The King of the Khyber Rifles'' -- but only so that nitroglycerin can be introduced into the story. And it piles on characters like snowflakes in a blizzard, though they exist solely to be dispatched in some of the garishly cinematic demises that Mr. Campbell and company have in store. 
After a particularly pointless conversation about mortality, someone says: ''All men die. It's what they do before then that counts.'' Such a sentiment doesn't begin to explain ''Vertical Limit.'' 
''Vertical Limit'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence, explosions, avalanches and intense and harrowing scenes of mountain climbing.

‽Moon Shadow‽,‽In Alberto Simone's ''Moon Shadow,'' Tcheky Karyo plays an uptight physicist named Lorenzo who returns after a 20-year absence to the small Sicilian town where he grew up. With his fastidious clothes and his hurried abrasiveness, he is easily recognized as an outsider. ''Are you from the North?'' asks Salvatore, the twinkly-eyed local elder who has come to fix the roof of Lorenzo's dilapidated ancestral home, intending a sly put-down in the guise of an innocent query. 
That Lorenzo will loosen up and come to terms with the repressed emotions beneath his rational, impatient demeanor seems inevitable. The agents of his transformation are Salvatore, played with mischievous warmth by Nino Manfredi, and the residents of a local therapeutic community for the mentally ill, run by a harried cardigan-wearing mensch of a doctor named Titto (Johan Leyson). 
''Crazy people scare me,'' Lorenzo confesses, but soon he is spending enough time in their midst to discover their essential humanity, and, of course, his own. 
''Moon Shadow'' (''Colpo di Luna''), which was shown at a number of European festivals in 1995 and opens today at Cinema Village, explores its delicate subject with restrained sentimentality. As Mr. Simone portrays them, Titto's charges are indeed sometimes scary, and sometimes comical in their tics and delusions. 
Movies about mental illness risk either romanticizing the subject or rendering it monstrous, and this film opts, though not egregiously, for romance. When the patients are shown frolicking at the seashore, or wandering into the courtyard of their residence in the midst of a rainstorm, one cannot escape the inference that they're meant to seem somehow more noble, and closer to nature, than their sane counterparts. 
Though this is a questionable notion, Mr. Simone doesn't push it too far, and he suggests, through Titto's mouth, that the alternative, a starkly medical approach to mental illness, is worse. And if Lorenzo's transformation seems a little forced, it's conveyed with a minimum of melodrama. 
The key to the movie is Salvatore, whose decency stops thankfully short of saintliness. His slowly developing friendship with Lorenzo, and his relationship with a particularly troubled young patient, are explored with understated tenderness, and Mr. Manfredi is a joy to watch. 
''Moon Shadow'' is a modest and thoughtful movie, and if it doesn't quite break new ground in addressing its difficult subject, it at least does not cheapen it.

‽Quills‽,‽One of the funniest and most riveting scenes in ''Quills'' sets the tone for the movie, though it doesn't come early. In the Charenton Asylum, Abbe Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) and Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) are discussing the best way to handle the infuriating Marquis de Sade, and as they walk, these men of reason are surrounded by demonstrations of the most modern medical treatments: bloodletting, phrenology and the like. It's the kind of casual absurdity that the film's director, Philip Kaufman, delights in, and ''Quills'' at its best lets him display a graceful wiliness. This story of the Marquis de Sade, adapted by Doug Wright from his play of the same title, isn't exactly a docudrama. It invents elements to make its rather obvious point about the price exacted by art and the state that liberals trying to do what's right can be whipped into. Fortunately, the elegance of Mr. Kaufman's direction and his handling of the cast make for the kind of euphoric stylishness that has been missing from moviegoing for some time. 
Much of that elan comes from Geoffrey Rush, who plays Sade as a gleeful voluptuary unfettered by either morality or what for him would be the most venal of sins, sentimentality. Sade is a flamboyant pansexual, a glittering vulture who exploits others for his own delectation. A man who views rot as the ultimate form of self-expression, he's quite vain about moral deterioration, and he keeps himself a bewigged and perfumed dandy. For him, his stay in the Charenton Asylum is merely slumming, a time when he gets to evaluate the damaged and discarded psyches that litter the rooms and decide which is his most apt target. And Mr. Kaufman revels in the chaos. 
Sade creates trouble because even while confined at Charenton, he manages to have his scandalous writing published. His scribblings, laundry lists of depravity, are smuggled out of the asylum by Madeleine (Kate Winslet), a virginal laundress eager to conspire with him. But Sade's writings are becoming a threat to the crumbling French establishment. The compassionate Coulmier thinks that Sade is a possible candidate for redemption, but is unable to keep him under wraps. Mr. Phoenix's thoughtful performance makes it clear that Coulmier clings to decency because it offers him self-definition and sanity; without it, he'd be lost, potentially worse off than any of the asylum's inmates. 
Coulmier's essential goodness marks him as a failure, and Napoleon dispatches the more businesslike Royer-Collard to silence Sade. (Mr. Caine's performance is tart and precise, a portrait of a man who isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is.) 
As conceived by Mr. Wright and Mr. Rush, Sade is a man so utterly convinced of his own allure that his confidence functions as a form of madness; what's really the difference between Sade and the inmate who thinks he's a bird? And as portrayed by Mr. Rush, Sade's spoiled conviviality is a disease; this awe-inspiring sociopath infects others with the need to do his bidding, and they go along happily. This could have made the other performers into no more than quirky straight men for Sade's arch blustering, but Mr. Kaufman solves this by focusing on Mr. Rush's face as he listens closely during dialogue. Like any good predator, he's waiting for the moment to pounce. 
Accentuating Sade's attention to others is Mr. Kaufman's way of putting the rest of the cast on an equal footing. Ms. Winslet rises to the challenge. She comes across as a member of the lower class whose native intelligence makes her worthy of Sade's notice. She knows it, too, and deploys her own wiles to keep him at bay. Ms. Winslet's shrewdness as an actress has never been better displayed than it is here, as she shows that she's aware of how intoxicating Sade's presence can be and is intrigued enough to go along for the ride. 
''Quills'' occasionally becomes pretentious and shrill -- sometimes Mr. Wright isn't aware that his material is so good that he doesn't need to comment on his characters, and the effect at the end of hoisting Sade on his own petard is totally unnecessary. But Mr. Kaufman moves the film briskly along. Like Sade, he loves stirring up trouble. 
''Quills''' is rated R. It contains nudity, violence, torture, sexuality and adult language.

‽Unbreakable‽,‽''Unbreakable,'' a follow-up to ''The Sixth Sense'' by the writer and director M. Night Shyamalan, is probably the most anticipated film of the season. As such, it is bound to disappoint because there is no way to repeat such a box office sensation. 
What ''Unbreakable'' shows is Mr. Shyamalan's remarkable growth as a director. Some of the sequences are particularly fine, crisp and contained, and given his thirst for commercial success, bewitchingly spare with long, fluid takes. 
Instead of following a huge hit with a wildly overcomplicated movie as long as a night of prime-time television, Mr. Shyamalan goes the other way. ''Unbreakable'' is tidy and compact, and seems to have been only grazed by plot. This is a superhero comic rendered as a haiku. It is Superman starring in ''The Seventh Seal'' with  an inspired twist: helping others only increases the hero's sadness. Mr. Shyamalan may be the only mainstream director hankering for success with a need to understate; he is like Shaq without the tattoos. The result is a mastery of craft that may leave some hungry for more. 
His ominous minimalism starts with his use of Bruce Willis. This actor is deprived of his bag of tricks -- his winner's swagger and a smirk that has inspired more on-screen action than any soft-core film star. Instead, the movie imbues his character, a security guard named David Dunn, with a tragic mournfulness from the outset. 
In the first scene, the unfailingly polite Dunn begins a conversation with a woman sitting next to him on a train, and the camera glides between the two of them, framing each person between the train's seats for a widescreen emphasis of their anxiety. Dunn's intensity scares the woman off and she scurries for another seat. That same train later crashes, leaving him unmarked and the sole survivor. (As a doctor delivers this news to Dunn, the sheets covering a corpse in front of them slowly brightens with blood.) 
Mr. Shyamalan's biggest interest is in investing his protagonists with a bone-deep empathy, which feels like an answer to the glib 80's heroes that Mr. Willis has played. Mr. Willis has the charisma to hold the audience with his pain. 
His life is contrasted with that of Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from a condition that makes him as fragile as a matzo. His mother (Charlayne Woodard, whose warm dimples suggest boundless care) lures the teenage Elijah (Johnny Hiram Jamison) out of the house and into the world with comic books. He grows up to become a successful and imperious dealer in comic book art, wearing ensembles resembling things that the designer Claude Montana might put together for ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and driving around Philadelphia in a Checker Marathon. (In this movie, a gallery show of comic book art attracts the kind of crowd more likely to turn up at a Vanity Fair Hollywood book party, a charming conceit.) 
Mr. Jackson's baleful charisma is deepened because Elijah, too, suffers. He does wonders with the role, giving haunted credibility to a part that comes with a hairpiece that makes him look like one of the Delfonics at the peak of their mighty, mighty Afroed glory. 
''Unbreakable'' is Mr. Shyamalan's tribute to comic books and superheroes, but he uses the comic book only as a starting point; he wants to investigate the properties of heroism. He offers tantalizing suggestions, but leaves a lot for the audience to fill in because he refuses to give in to the conventions of the genres; at no point, for example, does Dunn get to pump his arms and bellow, ''Yes!'' 
The comic book allusions come one right after another, although Mr. Shyamalan doesn't linger over them. Elijah, who learns of Dunn's mysterious survival, feels he has to force him into action: ''These are mediocre times,'' Elijah tells Dunn. ''People are starting to lose hope.'' 
Elijah explains Dunn's powers to him: invulnerability and a telepathic ability to feel people's criminal impulses. But Dunn has an Achilles' heel that comes into play during the  most intense scene, in which the hero tries to use his powers to aid someone in need. (In his hooded green poncho, Dunn resembles the the Spectre, a comics hero.) 
Audiences will bring high hopes to ''Unbreakable'' because of ''The Sixth Sense.'' Both ''Wide Awake'' (which had the grinding overdeliberateness of a particularly malevolent ''Afterschool Special'') and ''The Sixth Sense'' focused on children whose special sensitivity isolated them. Dunn could be the adult version of the boy from ''The Sixth Sense.'' The morbid ramifications of his gift emerge as ''Unbreakable'' goes on. 
Mr. Shyamalan shows that ''The Sixth Sense'' was no accident; deadpan melancholy has quickly become his signature. By giving Mr. Willis less to do, he gives him more time to concentrate on craft. Mr. Shyamalan also lets Mr. Jackson employ a dignified curiosity that he has never had a chance to use. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Shyamalan didn't seem to get around to writing parts for the rest of the cast. Robin Wright Penn, for example, is wasted as Dunn's wife. But you have to admire Mr. Shyamalan's willingness to lay back. He proves to be a major talent who has to wrestle with a nemesis of his own: his past success. 
''Unbreakable'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes adult language and scenes of psychological intensity and violence.

‽
‽102 Dalmatians‽,‽Disney is not a company known for leaving well enough alone. In its zeal to convert every successful movie into a franchise, the studio often crosses the line between giving audiences what they want and mindless overkill. 
The live-action remake of ''101 Dalmatians,'' released in 1996 to acquaint a new generation to an especially beloved tale, may have had the unintended effect of obscuring the original it meant to honor. But that movie, in part as a result of Glenn Close's delicious villainy in the role of Cruella DeVil, was at least an adequate piece of children's entertainment and a harmless bit of nostalgia for the grown-ups. 
The same cannot be said for the sequel, imaginatively titled ''102 Dalmations,'' in which Ms. Close, with a reprise of her earlier role, is reduced to shrieking hysteria and then subjected to grotesque humiliation. The plot is a perfunctory scramble of family-film conventions. Two anodyne, attractive young people, Kevin and Chloe (Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans) fall in love. Puppies are born -- perfectly housebroken, judging from the state of Chloe's cozy London apartment -- and frolic cutely for the cameras. 
In keeping with the supposed demand for juvenile pop culture that is hip, loud and crass as well as syrupy sweet, there is a beat-heavy theme song bitten off George Clinton's ''Atomic Dog,'' a second garish villain (Gerard Depardieu, sporting a yellow Billy Idol haircut and a leopard's-head codpiece), and a wisecracking macaw, who thinks he's a Rottweiler and who delivers his one-liners in the cockney squawk of the former Monty Pythonist Eric Idle. 
The setup seems calculated to baffle children, especially those whose memory of ''101 Dalmatians'' has dimmed. Cruella, it seems, has been cured by behaviorist therapy. To the surprise of Chloe, who happens to be her parole officer, Cruella, who now insists on being called Ella, has become a dog lover and an animal rights crusader. 
She magnanimously saves Kevin's animal shelter from bankruptcy, and redecorates it according to her own remarkable tastes. But the chimes of Big Ben suddenly reverse her therapy, and soon she enlists an evil furrier named Le Pelt (Mr. Depardieu) to help her fashion ''a hooded spotted puppy coat.'' The added feature of the hood requires an extra dog skin, and thus a whole new movie. 
As in the first one, most of the wit and originality in evidence are the work of the costume designer, Anthony Powell. Cruella's baroque couture reflects the vicissitudes of her temperament. In her nice phase, she's all feathers, flowers and appliqued birds' heads. Restored to her true nature, she decks herself out in repellent animal splendor. When she gets her just desserts -- quite literally, since at the end she's baked into a giant waddling layer cake -- what is meant as over-the-top slapstick turns ugly and mechanical. It's a tiresome retread of the ending of ''101 Dalmatians,'' which itself repackaged the excesses of the ''Home Alone'' movies. 
''102 Dalmatians'' will probably make some money, but many of the tickets are likely to be purchased more out of desperation than enthusiasm. Children are sure to respond to the animals, and adults may smile at a clever, if obvious, quotation from ''The Lady and the Tramp,'' but neither generation will find much to love. The most dispiriting news is that, so far, this movie is probably no worse than its principal competition. In a season like this, what's one dog more or less?

‽
‽Bounce‽,‽Don Roos's ultra-sleek romantic drama ''Bounce'' is a perfect illustration of the adage that God is in the details. Although its aspirations aren't much loftier than to meet the specifications of what might be called High Formula Hollywood moviemaking, this touching, finely  wrought bowl of suds is a seamless piece of work, comparable in its craft to ''Jerry Maguire'' and ''As Good as It Gets,'' if a bit slighter. 
The film's two stars, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck, emerge from the movie as the most soulful (if not the most torrid) romantic coupling to animate a Hollywood film in quite some time. As their characters tiptoe warily into each other's hearts, the  cross-currents of longing and anxiety rippling through their faces tell us exactly how much is at stake. 
For a change, it isn't simply a matter of will they or won't they end up in bed together but of whether these two complicated, strong-willed individuals can summon the courage to commit themselves to a serious  relationship. It has been ages since a  Hollywood screen couple, gazing into each other's eyes, conveyed this much emotion. 
As Abby Janello, the widowed mother of two young boys, Ms. Paltrow gives a performance of astounding delicacy and depth. Her tiniest, seemingly throwaway gestures and slightest changes of expression have the transparency of great screen acting on a miniature  scale. She is also utterly convincing as a harried, caring mother of two. 
Playing Buddy Amaral, a swaggering, gregarious advertising executive recovering from alcoholism, Mr. Affleck nearly matches Ms. Paltrow in the understated intensity and exquisite detail of his performance. More than once in the movie, his eyes tear up. But this actor, with his beseeching hound dog look and trembling lower lip, never becomes mawkish. His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined ''people person'' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive. 
''Bounce'' isn't anywhere near as nervy as ''The Opposite of Sex,'' the film that put Mr. Roos on the map as a fast-rising director and screenwriter. In its conventional, largely predictable story of commitment wariness among contemporary yuppies, you can feel the screenplay's gears churning and time the beats of its dialogue. Late in the movie, when Abby delivers the speech from which ''Bounce'' takes it title, it feels almost too neat. And a running joke about the meaning of the word ''dooryard'' (from Whitman) is repeated one too many times. 
But this carefully nurtured sense of snugness is also what High Formula movie-making is all about. What's remarkable about the screenplay and the calculated, somewhat  far-fetched plot is the dexterity with which Mr. Roos avoids small cliches to reinvigorate a larger one. 
In its texture, its eye for detail, and language, ''Bounce'' offers an extremely accurate portrait of the style and mood of the yuppie class in this country right now. For all the  emotions on display, it's a slightly chilly portrait. 
The opening scenes in an airport  perfectly capture the pent-up frantic experience of contemporary air travel. And the scenes in the advertising agency where Buddy is a high-flying partner in charge of the Infinity Airline account precisely calibrate the nerve-racking mixture of cynicism, bravado, creativity, defensiveness and public relations savvy in his cutthroat world. Later scenes of fast-talking real estate negotiations display a similar hard-edged knowingness. 
What spins the story into motion is Buddy's last-minute decision to give his plane ticket (on an Infinity flight) to a young Los Angeles writer he meets casually while held up by a snowstorm at O'Hare. The stranger, Greg Janello (Tony Goldwyn) is eager to return to his family in Los Angeles, while Buddy in giving up his ticket frees himself for an overnight fling with a pretty Dallas businesswoman. 
But when the plane crashes in Kansas, killing more than 200, including Greg, Buddy is guilt-stricken, and his drinking soon crosses the line into alcoholism. After embarrassing himself at an awards ceremony for his contributions to a saccharine Infinity Airlines ad, he checks into a rehab. 
The story skips ahead a year. Buddy has dried out but is still shaky inside. As part of his 12-step atonement, he pays a visit to Greg's widow, Abby, not telling her of his connection to her dead husband. She's now a novice real estate agent, and he connives to help her make a deal for the purchase of his own company's new quarters. Attracted to Buddy, Abby, who says she is divorced, hesitantly initiates a dating relationship. As it turns more serious, the inevitable, increasingly scary question looms of how and when Buddy will tell her the truth. 
Directing his own screenplay, Mr. Roos displays the same brilliant restraint that Kenneth Lonergan shows in ''You Can Count on Me,'' another ultra-realistic film that shares this movie's aversion to gratuitous melodrama. When Abby is informed of Greg's death, for instance, the camera pulls away to observe her reactions from afar, and its lack of proximity makes the far-off vision of her sudden flailing grief all the more wrenching. The movie completely omits the drama of Buddy's rehabilitation. Instead of zeroing in on its characters' heated confrontations, in most cases it prefers to show their aftermath. 
Enriching the film are some expertly fleshed-out minor characters, notably Buddy's hardnosed boss (Joe Morton) and his cheeky gay assistant (Johnny Galecki), a 12-step graduate who minces no words. If David Dorfman and Alex D. Linz as Abby's young sons are a little too Hollywood-cute for comfort, at least they're not gratingly so. 
''Bounce'' may be far from a great film, but its pleasures are consistent enough to remind you of how few movies nowadays come anywhere close to matching it in intelligence and emotional balance. It is not only a terrific date movie, but also one that doesn't make you feel ashamed afterward for getting misty-eyed. 
''Bounce'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

‽
‽Suspended Animation‽,‽A psychological horror film from the Midwest-based independent director John D. Hancock, ''Suspended Animation'' is a sturdy, well-made piece that never quite overcomes its structural flaws. 
Tom Kempton (Alex McArthur) is a celebrated animator who winters in northern Michigan, where a snowmobile accident leads him into the clutches of two weird sisters, Vanessa and Ann Boulette. Vanessa (Laura Esterman) is a willowy former dancer and Ann (Sage Allen) an overweight homebody, and they have been operating their own girl-power version of the notorious Wisconsin farmhouse of the 1950's serial killer Ed Gein, butchering passers-by and creating knick-knacks and gourmet meals from their body parts. 
Duct-taped to a wheelchair and tortured, Tom manages to escape when his snowmobile buddies fortuitously show up with some shotguns. The ensuing melee leaves the sisters presumed dead, but for Tom the nightmare is not over. Obsessed with Vanessa, he tracks down the illegitimate daughter (Maria Cina) she gave up 30 years earlier and finds her living in Hollywood, a bartender and would-be actress, under the name Clara Hansen. Tom hires her to pose for a character in his new animated feature, an allegorical account of his ordeal at the hands of her mother and aunt. 
After a slam-bang opening ''Suspended Animation,'' which opens today in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, goes into something of a coma itself with the tedious exposition necessary to get the plot convolutions across. It slowly develops that Clara, who is unaware of her heritage, has a sinister 15-year-old son (Fred Meyers), who may have inherited his grandmother's homicidal tendencies. At least that is Tom's suspicion when he comes across a mass of human tissue wrapped in aluminum foil and hidden in the boy's toolbox. 
The situation is creepy, but the screenplay by Dorothy Tristan, Mr. Hancock's wife and frequent collaborator, has trouble transforming it into genuine suspense. The menace remains vague and unfocused until one major character makes a not entirely unexpected reappearance in the last act, by which point much of the tension has been lost. 
Mr. Hancock, however, remains a fine director of actors, and Ms. Esterman, a gifted stage actress making a rare film appearance, delivers an eerily ambiguous performance, part lovable eccentric and part Hannibal Lecter. Though the film was shot on high-definition video, Mr. Hancock's framing has the steadiness and precision of classic 35-millimeter filmmaking, and his editing, far from the pointless MTV pyrotechnics in the current remake of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' is all but invisible and much more effective for it.

‽
‽Ali‽,‽''Ali'' is a breakthrough for its director, Michael Mann. The film, based on the life of Muhammad Ali, is Mr. Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds. 
That subject is a man whose mesmerizing surfeit of athleticism, beauty and moral and physical courage -- and enchanting lack of humility -- had no modern equivalent. As it follows, for roughly the first hour, Ali from the first Sonny Liston fight in 1964 through the duel with George Foreman in Zaire in 1974, the picture has a quick-moving breathlessness. Instead of soaking the movie in deadpan, minor-key electronica -- even Mr. Mann's directorial debut, ''Thief,'' employed the blue-steel proto-techno of Tangerine Dream -- ''Ali'' is fired up from the outset with a burst of, well, heat. 
We hear the strains of Sam Cooke getting a groove on to ''Bring It on Home to Me.'' But it isn't the velveteen rabbit Sam Cooke from the recordings of the time, muscular but always in control. It's the Sam Cooke heard on the posthumous recording ''Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963.'' There he unleashed himself from buttery smoothness. Playing to a black audience, he teased the crowd into a frenzy. It's an understanding of soul that one would never have expected from this director, who uses the music as entrance, to build tension, since Ali -- one of the most famous tongues of all times -- is nearly silent for the first 10 minutes or so. 
This is a brilliantly considered bit of stage setting; intercut with the song is Ali (Will Smith) jogging through bleak, wintry, nighttime streets, a squad car with a couple of white cops pulling over in front of him. ''What you runnin' from, son?'' one of them lazily asks, the casual racism colder than the night. 
Ali was the first black popular figure to break down the wall between performance for a black audience and for a white audience, which is what Cooke was straining to do, and the first 10 minutes of ''Ali'' seethe with ambition. Mr. Mann wants to get past the headlines about the most incendiary figure ever to enter the ring, a man whose wit -- both physical and verbal -- was so exciting that the world hung on his every word. 
For this reason ''Ali,'' in the abstract, seems like the wrong material for this filmmaker. For Mr. Mann, a man is defined by what he is does: in ''Heat,'' the thief (Robert De Niro) and the detective (Al Pacino), equally dogged, have no lives other than their occupations. And in Mr. Mann's world of existential working-class drama, a man stripped of his profession is nothing; that's what ''The Insider'' was all about. 
Muhammad Ali inside the ring and Muhammad Ali outside the ring were totally different men; his abrasive, magnetic daring and infectious self-love outside the ring galvanized the world and distracted many from his sniper's precision. He was a heavyweight with the fluttering gracefulness of a middleweight. He so flouted the established protocol of sports behavior that when the world sided with Liston, the scary black man, against Cassius Clay/Ali, the even scarier one, a black Muslim who represented the future, it signaled a paradigm shift. 
Ali was the African-American who exulted in saying exactly what he was capable of, and the bouncing-boy braggadocio of hip-hop is impossible to imagine without him. So it makes sense that one of his spiritual children, the sunny-dispositioned rapper turned actor Will Smith, would play him. And Mr. Smith's not short on self-regard either; running through the streets of Miami in Michael Bay's 1995 film ''Bad Boys,'' sweat glistening off the six-pack abs he proudly shows off in slow motion for the camera, he seemed ready to take on the part. For Mr. Smith, who thickened his frame to act Ali, it's a chance to, in the words of one of his songs, ''Boom! Shake the Room.'' 
The script has been developed to give Mr. Smith the opportunity to burrow inside Ali. There are moments of the rousing Ali, as he announces his refusal to go to Vietnam or spars with Howard Cosell, played by Jon Voight, whose portrayal is a riveting tribute to his character actor's instincts. Mr. Voight goes beyond impersonation; he makes Cosell a recognizable human being. 
Mr. Smith captures Ali's musicality, pausing in midsyllable while ranting and exhaling to punch things up and turn even a joke into something operatic. As written, Ali is reflecting on the world whizzing by him. Away from the media, Ali is solemn, almost melancholy, and his voice is lower, weighed down. This is where Ali becomes a Michael Mann figure: an ascetic dressed in dark clothes. 
Mr. Smith is surrounded by a cast that alternately rises and falls; only some of them are up to the challenge. One who is up to it is Jamie Foxx, as Drew (Bundini) Brown, Ali's manager and aide de camp and the phrase-making inventor of ''float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,'' who grasps the material hard and gives the performance of a lifetime. 
Mr. Foxx, who plumped up like a Ball Park frank, makes Brown a fascinating, open-faced display of vulnerability and machismo. There's a give and take in the relationship between Ali and Brown that can't be found in the rest of film. Ali's penchant for cruelty and his tendency to judge are all directed at Brown. The picture doesn't investigate the most amazing contradiction: during the most flamboyant moments of the black pride movement, the light-skinned Ali ridiculed his three main opponents, Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman, all of them dark-skinned men, as big, ugly bears and got away with it. 
Ali is depicted as a bystander sometimes, and Mr. Smith is stranded when he has to be contemplative. He springs to life, though, when he works with other actors; he is nuanced and engaged, and like Ali has an instinct for pleasure. And, like Ali, it comes through as he makes others twist in the wind; Mr. Smith's gift for counterpunching is as good as that of the man he's playing. 
The movie wants to be a warts-and-all look at the Greatest. Still, it skips through Ali's flaws -- his womanizing, for example -- more than shows them, except in the scenes with Ali and Brown together; there's a complicated friction here, with Ali being both admiring and resentful of Brown. Both actors get at something unnerving. Ali is a more rounded person in these instances: a bullet with butterfly wings. 
Ali's luster is further muddied in his interactions with Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles). After Malcolm is rebuked when his change of heart leads him to deviate from the teachings of the rigid Elijah Muhammad (Albert Hall), Ali abandons him. The movie doesn't shy away from this terrible moment, and Mr. Smith's stricken reaction almost makes up for Mr. Van Peebles's underwhelming turn. (Malcolm's assassination, using another Cooke song, ''A Change Is Gonna Come,'' is uncomfortably close to scenes in Spike Lee's ''Malcolm X.'') Flaws like the Malcolm X scenes come because Mr. Mann seems to have cast for physical resemblance to the real subjects. Mr. Van Peebles seems like a male model pondering a costume change. 
Ali's allegiance to Elijah Muhammad, despite protests from Sonji (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Belinda (Nona Gaye), his first and second wives, is prefigured in a line from the Cooke song that opens the film -- ''I will always be your slave, until I'm buried, buried in my grave'' -- though early on, that lyric serves as a counterpoint. 
''Ali'' offers stunning re-creations of bouts Ali fought. In the second Liston fight, the auditorium is underlighted and clouded with fetid cigar smoke, which was why the famous picture of a snarling Ali standing over Liston was so dramatic; indoor arenas are now bright enough to be spotted from Alpha Centauri. 
The men playing Liston (Michael Bentt), Foreman (Charles Shufford) and Frazier (James N. Toney) are professional boxers, and they all duplicate the original boxers' styles. During the ring sequences, ''Ali'' has more fealty to the matches than did the punch-outs of ''Raging Bull.'' The cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki, uses the wide screen to paint a number of vistas, with a freewheeling, hand-held vivacity that takes the director back to his documentary roots. The last section is devoted to the 1974 Ali-Foreman battle in Zaire, and it often -- sometimes too often -- evokes ''When We Were Kings,'' Leon Gast's glorious 1996 documentary on events surrounding that fight. (This movie sometimes plays like a more benevolent version of ''Ghosts of Manilla,'' Mark Kram's dissection of the Ali myth.) 
''Ali'' has to collapse several lifetimes worth of incidents into a manageable running time, which is too bad. Any of the fights and the incidents leading up to them could make a separate film; the movie is bent from ambition, but it doesn't crumple under the weight. 
The director's acuity is leavened by his passion, which is beguiling. It's reflected in some wondrous ways: many of the domestic settings, like Elijah Muhammad's home, with the living room furniture wrapped in plastic covers, begin as though captured for photographs, and then come to life as the characters start to speak. This is most evident in the superb scenes with Mr. Smith and Ms. Gaye in their loving but rapidly more troubled home. 
Mykelti Williamson surfaces in the Zaire section as Don King, a study in dynamic duplicity. The picture doesn't shy away Ali's impatience with King's perfidy, either. 
For ''Ali,'' the question becomes, how do you convey the excitement embodied by Muhammad Ali? The answer is that Mr. Mann wants his movie to do more than that. And more often than not, it does. We see the movie levitate when Ali and Brown chant, ''Float like a butterfly,'' the slogan that takes on a different meaning in each context, starting off as hopeful and spry, finally becoming rueful and pointed. When the film pulls off moments like these, it's breathtaking -- a near great movie. 
This movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence inside the ring and out, and strong language and sexual situations that make Ali seem more human than he may have been regarded before.

‽
‽Kate & Leopold‽,‽A long-running fantasy drilled into the minds of generations of American women by Hollywood movies and romance novels is that a refined, dapper Englishman with a cultivated accent and a title is the ultimate catch. That fantasy is made all the sweeter if the Englishman is a blast from the past. How about a courteous Victorian gentleman who stands when a lady rises from the table, refers to dating as courting and understands the language of flowers? (Orange lilies imply hatred, and begonias and lavender signal danger and suspicion.) 
But the cherry on this human sundae has to be his equestrian mastery. Once astride a horse, he becomes the embodiment of the proverbial knight on a white charger. Encountering such a creature, the only choice left for a stressed-out modern damsel is to shed her defenses, swoon in his arms and be carried off into a Victorian happily ever after. 
Enter the Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who gallops into Meg Ryan's life across a span of more than 100 years in the frothy romantic comedy ''Kate and Leopold.'' As Leopold, the dashing third duke of Albany and the world's most eligible bachelor in 1876, Mr. Jackman is as perfect a specimen of romance-novel dreaminess as Hollywood has concocted in quite a while. Leopold is no fool. He is credited with inventing the elevator. 
If ''Kate and Leopold'' were a 1940's movie, Ms. Ryan's character, Kate McKay, would probably be a wide-eyed shop girl (Loretta Young perhaps) weaned on Jane Austen and Emily Brontë who lands in the arms of Cary Grant or Laurence Olivier. Here she is a crisp, high-powered marketing maven whose company measures the public taste in everything from movies to margarine. 
Kate lives in a Manhattan apartment one flight down from her ex-boyfriend, Stuart Besser (Liev Shreiber), an eccentric scientist. Unbeknown to Kate, Stuart discovers a time-traveling portal that can be accessed by jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge at certain moments, and the movie's opening scene finds him newly arrived with a camera in late-19th-century Manhattan. 
Stuart winds up at a bash at which the Victorian duke, whose family fortunes are in dire need of replenishment, is about to announce his engagement to a wealthy but unattractive American heiress. When Leopold catches Stuart snooping around the house, Stuart flees, and Leopold chases him through the streets and up the side of the still unfinished Brooklyn Bridge from whose girders they tumble into the present through the same magic portal. As they arrive in 2001, all the elevators in Manhattan go haywire. 
''Kate and Leopold,'' directed by James Mangold from a screenplay he wrote with Steven Rogers, barely acknowledges reality, and that is its saving grace. It is essentially a Nora Ephron fairy tale with a sci-fi twist and a lot more plot than you might find in one of Ms. Ephron's cotton-candy daydreams. 
From the moment Kate and Leopold set eyes on each other, it's obvious that true love will soon blossom. And as it does, their romantic combat boils down to competing one-liner views of love and work with the cutesy twist that the woman is the cynic and the man the romantic. 
Kate snaps, ''You can't live a fairy tale,'' while Leopold floridly declares: ''Marriage is a promise of eternal love. As a man of honor I cannot promise eternally what I have never felt momentarily.'' Kate insists she doesn't have time for speeches from ''200-year-old men who have never had to work a day in their life.'' 
Once they're acquainted, Kate has the bright idea of featuring Leopold in a television commercial for a low-fat butter substitute. All goes swimmingly until Leopold samples the product he's hawking and stalks off the set, declaring it tastes like ''pond scum.'' 
''You have every convenience, every comfort, yet no time for integrity,'' he scolds. To which Kate replies, ''I've been paying dues all my life, and I'm tired, and I need a rest, and if I have to sell a little pond scum to get it, then so be it.'' 
Such exchanges may lack the tang of classic screwball comedy, but they have more flavor than most comic movie dialogue nowadays. Ms. Ryan's lines sound custom written to suit her snippy, plastic pertness, while Mr. Jackman lends Leopold's haughty pronouncements enough good humor to keep his character from turning into an insufferable twit. 
Leopold is an Emily Post-like repository of dating etiquette, which he is more than happy to pass on to others. His tips to Kate's crude, doltish brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer) help Charlie get to first base with his own dream girl. Dropping by a restaurant where Kate's manipulative boss J. J. Camden (Bradley Whitford) is trying to impress Kate with his bogus passion for opera, Leopold trumps him with his knowledge of ''La Bohème.'' (There's just one catch. ''La Bohème'' wasn't written until 1896, two decades after Leopold's leap into the present.) 
In the most dramatic scene Kate's purse is snatched as she is hailing a cab on Fifth Avenue, and Leopold promptly borrows a handy carriage horse and heroically charges into Central Park to apprehend the mugger. 
As I said, ''Kate and Leopold'' has only the most tangential relation to reality, and therein lies its slender charm. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

‽
‽Joe Somebody‽,‽The innocuous new Tim Allen comedy, ''Joe Somebody,'' could be described as a middle-aged corporate version of the 97-pound weakling facing down the bully at the beach. Here the bully, instead of kicking sand in the weakling's face and calling him skinny, punches him out in front of his 12-year-old daughter when he complains that the bully has broken the rules and taken his company parking space. Instead of following a Charles Atlas regimen, the weakling takes a crash course in martial arts with a former star of grade-C kung fu movies. 
A major reason the film's humor is so pallid is that Mr. Allen, unlike another major movie star with the same last name, isn't the likeliest candidate for the role of a weakling who transforms himself into a he-man. Even playing a bespectacled wimp, Mr. Allen exudes a one-of-the-guys take-charge authority. He is simply incapable of playing the fool or shedding his dignity. In a role that calls for slapstick humiliation, the best Mr. Allen can manage is the brave wide-eyed smile of a man bearing up under persecution. 
His character, Joe Scheffer, is a beleaguered, newly divorced video communications specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company. Denied a promotion and wincing every time he watches his artsy ex-wife, Callie (Kelly Lynch), ostentatiously cuddling with her new boyfriend (Ken Marino), Joe, when pressed to express his feelings, complains he is disappearing. 
After the incident in the parking lot, he plays hooky from work until Meg Harper (Julie Bowen), who runs what's called the ''corporate wellness'' program, is dispatched to his house to persuade him to return and participate in one of her ''anger defusion'' workshops. Joe is catapulted out of his funk by his realization, prompted by Meg, that the one thing in life he wants most is a rematch with the bully, Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton). Her visit also kindles in Joe the first stirrings of a growing romantic interest. 
Once word spreads through the company that Joe is spoiling for a fight, his popularity soars. It turns out everyone has wanted to take a punch at Mark. Joe is invited to play squash with the company's macho in-crowd; beautiful women begin ogling him; and he proves he's a good sport by getting down and funky in a karaoke bar. Before long he is the proud owner of a power suit and a spiffy new Cadillac. 
Observing Joe's transformation from wimp into cool guy, but through critical eyes, is his precociously talented daughter, Natalie (Hayden Panettiere), who sinks into her own funk and refuses to write the school play. 
Directed by John Pasquin from a screenplay by John Scott Shepherd, ''Joe Somebody'' continually squanders its opportunities for hilarity. Especially disappointing are Joe's martial arts lessons with the faded kung fu star Chuck Scarett. Flatly played by Jim Belushi, the character conveys none of the roar of a natural-born fighter. These sequences should have been a Chaplinesque carnival of pratfalls. 
For humor the movie is content to take timid potshots at corporate life. The funniest bit is a satirical commercial for an antidepressant that promises to ''make you better than you really are,'' but whose long list of possible side effects includes almost every alarming symptom you could imagine. The company's driveways are festooned with little round signs bearing icky messages like ''Choose caring'' and ''Choose happiness.'' On one sign a practical joker has scrawled in ''Choose Vicodin.'' 
The real villain of the piece turns out to be Jeremy Callahan (Greg Germann), a power-hungry corporate snake with designs on Meg. When Jeremy boasts of being in prime fighting shape from having taken Jazzercise and Pilates classes, they're obvious buzzwords signaling his effeteness. In the macho ethos of ''Joe Somebody'' only one-on-one combat qualifies as manly. 
''Joe Somebody'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

‽
‽How High‽,‽The clouds of marijuana smoke wafting through ''How High'' are so thick that at moments the haze from all that ganja threatens to obscure the actors' faces. This chaotic mess of a film, starring the rap stars Method Man and Redman as a hip-hop Cheech and Chong, has the disjointed quality of a stoned-out fantasy. Many of the faces that emerge through the murk appear bug-eyed. And much of the dialogue, which is frequently shouted, is only semi-intelligible. The movie, directed by Jesse Dylan from a screenplay by Dustin Lee Abraham, is so loosely constructed that its scenes don't track. 
At heart ''How High'' is a joshing, sardonic ode to ''blunts and booty'' that preaches the same message as a 60's hippie flick exalting the liberating potential of pot, but in a different language. A couple of tokes of magic weed, it suggests, will set you free. Once Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman), two pot-smoking buddies, land at Harvard, the staid university is helpless against the power of their stash, gleaned from a plant nurtured by the ashes of Silas's best friend, Ivory (Chuck Davis), who accidentally incinerated himself. In a matter of weeks Harvard turns into the hardest partying school on the planet. 
The stuff is so potent that when smoked it conjures up the genielike appearance of Ivory himself. It was his omniscient ghost who gave Silas and Jamal the answers to their college entrance exams. Their perfect test scores guaranteed access to any university of their choosing. Near the end of the film Ivory shows up with his new stoned-out buddy in the hereafter, Benjamin Franklin, who is credited with having invented the bong. 
Amid all the jokes about dope and sex, the movie manages to slip in some racial humor. Spalding Gray has a frenetic turn as a ludicrous white professor of black studies who is so guilt ridden that he pleads to his students, ''Lynch me! Lynch me!''  But the villain of the piece is a prudish black professor, Dean Cain (Obba Babatundé), whose grandeur is temporarily punctured when he unsuspectingly munches on some marijuana brownies. Under their influence his inner funkster takes over, and he becomes the gyrating, trash-talking life of the party. 
''How High'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and is crammed with profanity.

‽
‽The Majestic‽,‽A man out of place arrives in a small town and finds himself, while David Ogden Stiers, as Doc, puts one of his caring paws on the confused young fella's shoulder. 
No, it's not the Michael J. Fox vehicle ''Doc Hollywood''; that movie had a sense of humor. This time around it's ''The Majestic,'' which does not. (Imagine if Preston Sturges remade ''Hail the Conquering Hero,'' siphoned out all the humor and replaced it with high-calorie sentimentality.) 
Jim Carrey, stripped of his antic impulse, stands tall, his mouth slightly open with awe, while the camera dollies in to ogle him appreciatively. It's 1951, and he's an amnesiac who has wandered into Lawson, a hamlet in Northern California where the streets are empty, and the local movie theater, the Majestic, has been abandoned since what seems like the advent of talkies. The citizenry is still getting over the number of young men it lost to World War II, and the Majestic is Lawson's decayed crucible of hope. 
Our hero resembles Luke Trimble, a decorated veteran who has gone missing, and Luke's anguished dad, Harry (Martin Landau), clings to the idea that his lost son has come home. In need of a mission, our hero, who comes to believe he is Luke, decides to rebuild the deserted movie palace with the help of the townsfolk and Harry, the owner and projectionist. He does this, in the most languorous way possible, in the most indolent waste of screen time since Andy Warhol's marathon shot of the Empire State Building. It's in the tradition of ''Gee, my dad's got a barn -- let's put on a show.'' This Naugahyde-bound phony will play like a charm on the American Movie Channel, the Jurassic Park of film. 
The director, Frank Darabont, wields metaphors like flashcards and brings to ''The Majestic'' the shopworn back-lot belief in the decency of man that made his ''Green Mile'' such a shabby enterprise. 
In ''The Green Mile,'' set on death row at a Louisiana prison in 1935, we were led to believe that every guard but one was a forward-thinking liberal embarrassed by a shambling, humble black man. In ''The Majestic''  the residents of Lawson discover that Luke is actually Peter Appleton, a screenwriter targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and they rally around him. That's because they know that deep down, like every movie hero, he could never really have been a Communist. And it turns out he wasn't. In the movies everyone is always accused of being a Communist, but no star is ever actually a party member. If there had been as few Communists as American movies on the subject contend, party meetings would have been deserted. 
A few members of the Darabont repertory players, like James Whitmore and Jeffrey DeMunn, acquit themselves well. Gerry Black, as the honorable, decent black man of ''The Majestic,'' does miracles with his deep, gentle voice; mercifully, he isn't sacrificed, as the black Christ figure was in ''The Green Mile.'' 
And rarely has a newcomer been so well served by a movie as Laurie Holden, who plays Adele, Luke's ex-girlfriend. She's given a dream lacquer coat of lip gloss, and the camera blows kisses at her cheekbones. She's beautiful, but her no-nonsense presence is part of her performance, too: Adele has an unshakable authority. 
Mr. Carrey takes to the screen like a star, but that's all the movie asks of him. He plays the same guileless naïf he portrayed in ''The Truman Show''; like many comic actors, when he works in drama, he drains all the joy from the role. A few years ago he gave a capable, thought-out performance in the television movie ''Doing Time on Planet Earth,'' but there he had something to work with. 
In ''The Majestic'' he's just the spark plug for the plot, draped in gorgeous outfits and seated in a polished Mercedes convertible that just screams ''the Past'' -- that indistinct era that makes the 1950's seem like the 1920's or 30's. (Didn't anything ever get dirty or worn in the Past?) 
He is not helped by time-wasting devices like pouring and drinking a glass of water in extremely slow motion. There's a likable parody of grade-Z movie serials, and Peter's eyes shimmer with pride as the actors in the film within the film, including Bruce Campbell as the dimple-chin hero, recite dumb lines Peter wrote way back when. (When Harry runs the film at the Majestic, he tells Peter it's a good movie; too bad the screenwriter, Michael Sloane, didn't seize this chance to show that even the residents of Lawson had some taste.) 
Mr. Carrey has one other good scene at the opening of the film, when he sits in a studio meeting, and we overhear the voices of blustering studio executives with no confidence in anything but their contempt for the American public as they gut a potential project. (Among the offscreen voices are those of Rob Reiner, whose company, Castle Rock, produced ''The Majestic,'' and Garry Marshall.) With its lazy, heavy-handed nostalgia, ''The Majestic'' is just the kind of picture those studio executives would love. 
''The Majestic'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some smooching between Peter and Adele, the clumsy faked violence of the serial and the kind of infelicitous language studio executives are prone to.

‽
‽Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius‽,‽Like a classroom full of fourth graders jacked up on Mountain Dew and Sour Patch Kids -- like its target audience, in other words -- ''Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius'' just can't sit still. The movie, based on the Nickelodeon series of the same name, is so full of whirring gizmos, ricocheting projectiles and giddy hyperactivity that it makes the year's other computer-animated children's movies, ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Shrek,'' seem quiet and contemplative by comparison. 
Following the venerable Nickelodeon formula -- ''Rugrats,'' ''Spongebob Squarepants'' -- ''Jimmy Neutron'' sends a gaggle of bratty, lovable animated figures with disproportionately large heads off on a series of unlikely adventures. To keep accompanying adults amused, the picture is larded with winks, smirks and pop-culture citations intended to sail over the heads of synaptically overloaded youngsters. 
At one point the hero, an energetic young inventor whose full name is James Isaac Neutron, analyzes a note forged by alien invaders over his parents' signature. ''This is nothing like Mom's writing,'' he exclaims. ''The serifs and kerning are all wrong.'' This line sent me straight to the dictionary, but it should nonetheless inspire appreciative chuckles from typesetters in the audience. 
Jimmy lives in a cartoon suburb tongue-in-cheekily called Retroville, which explains both his post-Sputnik gee-whiz approach to science and his parents' hairstyles. Mom in her immovable flip and Dad in his shiny vinyl pompadour seem to have stepped out of a lost animated spin-off combining ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' with ''The Monkees.'' She is a sensible, no-nonsense Laura Petrie, while her husband, with his granny glasses and distracted amiability, seems to have left some of his mind on Venice Beach back in 1966. 
Their son, meanwhile, spends his time in the lab, accompanied by his robot dog, Goddard, tinkering away on useful gadgets: shrink rays, portable jet packs and a toaster-based satellite designed to communicate with alien life-forms. 
The success of this last project spells trouble for Retroville. A race of slimy green egg-shaped creatures, lead by King Goobot and his henchman Ooblar (hammily voiced by Patrick Stewart and Martin Short), picks up the signal and abducts the town's grown-ups. Free of adult supervision, Jimmy and his schoolmates go on an all-night junk-food binge, followed by the inevitable sugar blues, which send them across the galaxy in search of parental guidance. 
This plot turn is handled with a minimum of sentimentality, and it provides a moment of surreal beauty as the children drift through space on airships fashioned out of carnival rides. The hapless grown-ups, meanwhile, are about to be sacrificed to an extraterrestrial poultry god, and a thrilling air battle ensues between Jimmy's plucky young squadron and King Goobot's armada of robot-chicken fighter rockets. 
Aside from Jimmy, Retroville's youth is represented by a well-chosen assortment of schoolyard archetypes. Jimmy's best friends are Carl, a tubby, nervous fellow with heavy glasses and an inhaler, and Sheen, who is geekily obsessed with a video game action hero called Ultra-Lord. Jimmy has an unacknowledged crush on Cindy, the second smartest kid in the class, whose research in evolutionary biology supports a hypothesis of female superiority in the animal kingdom. (Jimmy, in a tense show-and-tell confrontation, questions the objectivity of her research.) Cindy, though, is besotted with Nick, a lollipop-sucking bad boy in denim and prepubescent sideburns. 
''Jimmy Neutron'' is as jam-packed with incident as its frames are stuffed with information. It has the bright Rube Goldberg energy of one of Jimmy's contraptions, and it resists the common kid-movie tendency to lecture its young audience about individuality, self-esteem or other stuff they hear enough about in school. 
The animation, on the other hand, sacrifices warmth and coherence for color and speed. So many images bombard your retinas that none of them makes much of an impression. But maybe I'm hopelessly mired in my own private Retroville. After ''Jimmy Neutron'' was over, I felt glassy-eyed and a little headachy. But the boy genius who accompanied me to the screening could not take his eyes off the screen. I think he's in his room right now, building a shrink ray to try out on his dad.

‽The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring‽,‽There are two groups probably sharing the same dread about the film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ornate and busy ''Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' -- its most loving adherents and those who have spent their lives avoiding the books. But neither side is likely to be disappointed by the director Peter Jackson's altogether heroic job in tackling perhaps the most intimidating nerd/academic fantasy classic ever. 
Given that huge portions of the movie are devoted to exposition (there's a crushing amount of explanation required), Mr. Jackson has simmered the novel down to the most compact action-epic that could be made of it. As director and co-scriptwriter (he wrote the adaptation along with Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh) he understood that what propels the story forward are the battles between the forces of good and evil -- a word from which British stage actors can extract at least three syllables. 
One of those British actors, Ian McKellen, plays Gandalf, the wizard and friend to the Baggins family. Gandalf drops in on the Shire to visit his hobbit friend Bilbo (Ian Holm) on his 111th birthday. (It's good to see Mr. Holm and Sir Ian together, even though the special effect required to make the hobbit diminutive and Gandalf lanky and majestic interferes with their ease.) 
During the celebration, Bilbo passes a ring on to his nephew, Frodo (Elijah Wood), and this ring places Frodo in the center of a struggle for the future of the world. The ring, which contains an evil wizard's ''cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life,'' must be destroyed in the fire Pits of Mordor, where it was created. Even the towering Gandalf is afraid of this master ring. 
''Fellowship'' then slips into a series of chases and pitched battles, each with a bit more at stake because the ring's power to tempt those who come in contact with it becomes a bigger factor. Mr. Jackson has exploited the anecdotal nature by turning ''Fellowship'' into an escalating group of cliffhangers. This is the craftiest way to deal with the essence of ''Fellowship,'' shrinking the border between seduction and greed. When the ring corrupts each side, what's the difference between those who want it to do what's right and those who want it for less selfless reasons? 
Tolkien's books were written and passed around from zealot to zealot long before fantasy became the order of the day in contemporary popular culture, which is why so much of ''Fellowship'' will seem familiar to those who know nothing about them. (Tolkien devotees are probably still wiping the bad taste of Ralph Bakshi's poky 1978 animated adaptation from their mouths.) 
Rather than emphasize the similarities to George Lucas's mythology, Mr. Jackson gallops straight through them, trimming away as many of the complications as possible. ''Fellowship'' may still feel like ''Star Wars'' and just about every other otherworldly battle epic of the last 30 years -- a whopping composite of Christian allegory, Norse mythology and a boys' book of adventure. There's not much of a place for women on the loamy, rich dream scapes of Middle Earth; they enter the action briefly as if they were dream figures, part of the film's subconscious, like the glorious Elf queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the magical Arwen (Liv Tyler). 
''Fellowship'' centers on a band composed of the hobbits Frodo and his best friend, Sam (Sean Astin); the wizard Gandalf; and a pack of warriors that include the humans Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean), the angry dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the elf archer Legolas (Armando Bloom). 
Mr. Jackson apparently feels that the way to keep each of the fighting groups separate in the audience's minds is to provide them with hairstyles reminiscent of 1970's bands. The hobbits all have heads of tossled curls -- they're like members of Peter Frampton's group. Aragorn and Boromir have the long, unwashed bushes of Aerosmith, and the flaxen-maned Legolas has the fallen-angel look of one of the Allman Brothers. (The tubby, bilious and bearded Gimli could be a roadie for any of them.) ''Fellowship'' plays like a sword-and-sorcery epic produced by VH-1. Together, they rock against the forces of Sauron -- the evil wizard who created the Ring that Frodo holds. They have to pass through a cavernous passageway to fight through the assortment of nightmare creatures that Sauron sends to stop them. 
In Tolkien's book, each obstacle represents what is by now a kitschy level of enlightenment; once it's surmounted, you can never go back. Though this sadder-but-wiser educational experience is integral to the story, rather than snip it away, the director lingers on the mournfulness. When Frodo's band of brothers has to endure its sacrifices, the movie has a sense of loss. Mr. Jackson gets more feeling into ''Fellowship'' than he did with his previous films, like ''Heavenly Creatures'' and the bracing shock comedy ''Dead Alive'' and ''The Frighteners'' (which contained milder elements from ''Dead Alive''). He's better at this stuff than the happy shenanigans at Bilbo's birthday bash in the Shire; it's an entire village of comic relief. Mr. Jackson is a deft filmmaker, though, combining humor and horror in the same scene -- so that the actors' takes of disbelief when yet another menace materializes are so expressive they seem like part of the storytelling. 
The movie gets going once the quest begins and the adventurers hit the road. Since the actors serve a plot need rather than filling out characterization, the movie succeeds when the performers quickly communicate their functions. Mr. Wood's light, tremulous voice for Frodo and earnest, pointed face offer decency. He sometimes seems to possess the visage that Michael Jackson has spent a lot of money having sculptured by man-made means. 
Sir Ian's good-humored courtliness goes a long way, especially in his scenes with his former mentor-turned-nemesis, the wizard Saruman; he's played by Christopher Lee as if he were still Dracula rising from the grave. Mr. Mortensen's tendency to withhold as an actor informs Aragorn's nobility, and he moves well with a sword; it gives him an action hero's passion, which contrasts with Bean's conflicted Boromir. 
If the actors had more to do, the picture might run longer than its current 165 minutes. At that length some may find the movie exhausting, since those not caught up in the story -- which will seem reiterative because Tolkien's prose has been pillaged so often -- may find themselves indifferent to ''Fellowship.'' The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned. 
''Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' is rated PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned) for the plethora of menacing creatures who eventually have to be encountered and slaughtered.

‽
‽Not Another Teen Movie‽,‽An English class at John Hughes High School. The teacher, interrupted by a burst of flatulence from one of his students and a burst of laughter from the rest of them, launches into an impassioned tirade against the younger generation's sense of humor. Meanwhile, three clumsy, sex-crazed freshmen are perched in an air duct above the girls' bathroom, where they witness a young woman's intestinal distress. 
As the teacher winds up his speech, he invokes Shakespeare, Molière, and the tradition of ''sublime poetic genius,'' which today's youth has abandoned in favor of a fascination with ''human excrement.'' Q.E.D.: no sooner does he utter these words than the air duct collapses, followed by the floor of the toilet stall, a cataclysm that douses the poor man's classroom in something other than sublime poetic genius. 
One's response to this scene is anticipated by the title of the movie in which it occurs. ''Not Another Teen Movie'' is a raunchy send-up both of raunchy teen comedies like ''American Pie'' and of their sweet, romantic step-siblings. It is, in other words, a parody of parodies, of self-parodies and of itself. It makes fun of toilet humor while indulging in it and mocks slobbery adolescent prurience while displaying plenty of naked female flesh. (There is, for example, a foreign exchange student named Areola, who walks the halls of J.H.H.S. wearing nothing but a backpack, at once poking fun at the ''American Pie'' movies and going further than they dared to.) 
Directed by Joel Gallen, who cut his teeth producing the MTV movie awards, ''Not Another Teen Movie'' is a happy, nasty and frequently hilarious assault on 20 years' worth of youth pictures. That these movies have become a tradition unto themselves is acknowledged in frequent homages to Mr. Hughes. At the school that bears his name, the football team plays in Harry Dean Stadium (whose sad-sack-dad role is lampooned by Randy Quaid), and the students eat lunch in Anthony Michael Hall (the sad-sack-best-friend role is lampooned by Eric Jungmann). 
Molly Ringwald, the Ingrid Bergman of Reagan-era American adolescence, appears in a late cameo as a cynical, foul-mouthed flight attendant. (Her sad-sack-sensitive-rebel-girl role is lampooned by Chyler Leigh.) Paul Gleason, who played the corrupt disciplinarian in ''The Breakfast Club,'' shows up to lampoon himself in a reprise of one of that film's famous scenes. 
Mr. Hughes's movies are scrambled with their more recent derivations, especially the towering oeuvre of Freddie Prinze Jr., the Tab Hunter of Clinton-era adolescence, here impersonated by Chris Evans. The soundtrack, hairstyles and clothes reflect this collision of zeitgeists. The main story line, such as it is, commingles the plot of Mr. Prinze's first big hit, ''She's All That,'' with Mr. Hughes's ''Pretty in Pink'' and also makes reference to some of Mr. Prinze's other work, like that movie where he plays the guy who, like, falls in love with this girl and then, like, umm, I forget. 
Among the five credited writers are Phil Beauman and Buddy Johnson, able spoofers whose résumés include the ''Scary Movie'' movies and the faux-neo-blaxploitation epic ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.'' Like those pictures, this one demonstrates a knack for hitting easy targets. 
''Not Another Teen Movie'' is a parade of archetypes, from the Bitchy Cheerleader (Jaime Pressly) to the Dumb Fat Guy (Ron Lester) to the Token Black Guy (Deon Richmond), who is on hand to contribute dated hip-hop slang. (The T.B.G. is a recent addition to the teen-pic formula; the Chicago suburbs in Mr. Hughes's movies were so white that Ms. Ringwald could seem exotically ethnic.) 
The racial bad faith of recent youth cinema is also twitted when Mr. T. turns up on the sidelines of the Big Game as ''the wise janitor'' who dispenses sage advice that will enable the hero to learn valuable life lessons. 
Mr. Gallen keeps the gags moving along, and inserts some clever, if obvious, swipes at the visual conventions of pubescent cinema: the slow-motion pretty-girl entrance, the raucous party scene, the tender father-daughter heart to heart. He and his partners also have the good sense to extend the teen movie rubric to include ''American Beauty,'' represented by a weirdo with a cam-corder who is followed around by a plastic bag labeled ''the most beautiful thing in the world.'' 
In a climactic motel room showdown, after the Popular Jock (a k a the reformed cool guy, a k a the Freddie Prinze Jr. character) has punched out the Cocky Blond Guy, the cheerleader and the weirdo, he takes a swing at the bag. ''I don't know what this is for,'' he says. Maybe not, but it's the most sublime piece of film criticism I've seen in some time. 
''Not Another Teen Movie'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Such language! Such behavior! Kids these days!

‽Vanilla Sky‽,‽Those teeth! Those abs! That shining, perfectly coiffed helmet from which the 33-year-old protagonist of ''Vanilla Sky'' meticulously plucks a single, offending, all-but-invisible gray hair! Who else could play the vainest, cockiest young master of the universe ever to strut across the screen wearing an obnoxiously triumphant grin but Tom Cruise, that high-strung human racehorse oozing ambition like perspiration? 
Yes, ''Vanilla Sky'' is a timely fable about male vanity. The message of the film, which reunites the star with Cameron Crowe, who directed him in ''Jerry Maguire,'' isn't exactly reassuring. Looks are everything, it says, with money (preferably oodles of it) a close second. But if you lose your looks, all the money in the world won't mean diddly unless it can somehow buy them back. 
In this highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory, Mr. Cruise emerges from a near-fatal car crash with a grotesquely disfigured face. Then, through a miracle of cosmetic surgery, his beauty and the perfect love it once attracted are restored. Or so it seems. 
Two-thirds of the way through the film, what began as a fairly conventional allegory of a soulless cad's spiritual redemption turns into a swatch of science fiction that owes a great deal to the classic coneheads episode of ''Star Trek.'' To say much more would be to spoil the guilty pleasure of a movie whose barreling narrative drive and soundtrack (a rich musical stew that recalls the Beatles' ''White Album'') partly camouflage a multitude of flaws. 
''Vanilla Sky'' has been faithfully adapted from the Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenábar's 1997 romantic thriller ''Abre los Ojos'' (''Open Your Eyes'') into a star vehicle for Mr. Cruise, its story transplanted to New York City from Spain and amplified by a blockbuster budget. Redemption (by true love or a heroic exercise of will) has been the theme of some of Mr. Cruise's biggest hits, and here it takes on a more personal resonance than in any of his previous films. 
When we first meet Mr. Cruise's character, David Aames, his only worries besides those troublesome strands of gray are his terrifying nightmares. In the first of the film's several flashy dream sequences, David finds himself running in panic through a deserted Times Square. The early scenes show David wallowing gleefully in the gargantuan millennial equivalent of a Playboy penthouse. His palace on the Upper West Side of Manhattan has acres of space and fine art (including a Monet painting with a ''vanilla sky''). 
The morning after a night of passion, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), David's newest plaything in an endless succession of beautiful women, goes over the moon about his prowess as a lover. But for David, an affair that seems about to burst into true love is strictly recreational. David is so indifferent to Julie he doesn't bother inviting her to his 33rd birthday bash. He is mildly irritated when she crashes the party and observes him flirting with Sofia Serrano (Penélope Cruz), the date of David's best friend, sidekick and sycophantic doormat, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee). 
But Sofia, a dancer, seems to exude a special radiance. Or as David crows, she is ''the last guileless woman in New York.'' Overnight, the man who had everything but true love finally has it all. Leaving Sofia's apartment the next morning, David is surprised to find Julie waiting outside in a car to offer him a lift. In the film's most powerful scene, she lets him have it, becoming increasingly unstrung with jealousy and rage as she guns the accelerator and drives the vehicle off a bridge in a suicide leap. 
Days later, David emerges from a coma, afflicted with blinding headaches and with one side of his face disfigured. The best his team of doctors can do is to provide him with a flesh-colored latex mask. In a scene reminiscent of Mr. Cruise's most anguished moments in ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' David freaks out in a disco and ends up abandoned in a gutter by Sofia and Brian. 
Here the story abruptly wanders into alien territory, as David, wearing the mask, finds himself questioned by a sympathetic doctor (Kurt Russell) in a mysterious interrogation room. Racing against time, David must come up with evidence that he wasn't responsible for Julie's death. ''Vanilla Sky'' turns into a Hitchcockian riddle, at times reminiscent of ''North by Northwest'' and ''Vertigo,'' that takes a giant, awkward leap into allegorical science fiction. 
As it leaves behind the real world and begins exploring life as a waking dream (this year's most popular theme in Hollywood movies with lofty ideas), ''Vanilla Sky'' loosens its emotional grip and becomes a disorganized and abstract if still-intriguing meditation on parallel themes. One is the quest for eternal life and eternal youth; another is guilt and the ungovernable power of the unconscious mind to undermine science's utopian discoveries. David's redemption ultimately consists of his coming to grips with his own mortality, but that redemption lacks conviction. 
Mr. Cruise so dominates the film with his taut, intensely focused drive that ''Vanilla Sky'' takes on an autobiographical resonance. For all its allegorical weight, the question haunting the film's subtext is how much longer Hollywood's ranking proto-yuppie, now 39, can get away with playing boy wonders straining after record-breaking achievements. 
What carries the movie is Mr. Cruise's impeccable marathon-man star turn in a performance that is characteristically icy beneath a bluff, glittering, ever-boyish charm. Ms. Cruz, reprising the role she played in the original Spanish film, has no problem conveying her character's guilelessness, but her performance is seriously weakened by barely competent English-language line readings that are just one step above phonetic pronunciation. 
Many viewers will be hard pressed to see why David prefers Sofia over Julie, especially since Ms. Diaz gives so ferociously emotional a performance. The movie also loses crucial stamina in the plodding dialogues between David and the psychiatrist, played by a miscast Mr. Russell. 
With its roller-coaster plot and surreal special effects, ''Vanilla Sky'' is not the kind of film one associates with Mr. Crowe. The most warm-hearted of mainstream Hollywood directors, Mr. Crowe has in the past extended to his characters the affection of an unusually careful and sympathetic listener. That tenderness was never more palpable than in ''Almost Famous,'' his gently rose-tinted remembrance of the early-70's rock culture and his years as a teenage music journalist. 
In the often forced-sounding dialogue in ''Vanilla Sky,'' that ear is not as sharp. Still, the movie carries a lingering tug of sweetness. It is most apparent in the film's heady soundtrack, which includes choice nuggets of R.E.M., Peter Gabriel, early Bob Dylan and Todd Rundgren and a lovely wisp of a Paul McCartney song especially written for the movie. More than any other element, the soundtrack evokes the dream of eternal youth that infuses ''Vanilla Sky.'' The music guides us to the movie's heart. 
''Vanilla Sky'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, strong language and mild violence.

‽
‽The Business of Strangers‽,‽Whether exuding Manhattan-style noblesse oblige in ''Six Degrees of Separation'' or Washington-style political clout in ''The West Wing,'' Stockard Channing embodies the sort of patrician grandeur that actors like Mary Astor and Barbara Stanwyck conjured in their more upscale movie roles. And in ''The Business of Strangers,'' Patrick Stettner's chilly corporate nightmare, her aristocratic command inflects her portrait of a hardened, lonely American businesswoman at the top of her game with a hint of tragedy. 
When we first meet Ms. Channing's character, Julie Styron, she is on the way from an airport to a hotel to make an important presentation. Informed by cellphone that her company's chief executive has unexpectedly flown in for a personal meeting, Julie automatically assumes she is about to be fired and arranges a hasty interview with a slippery corporate headhunter, Nick Harris (Frederick Weller), who offers guarded encouragement. 
To make matters worse, Julie's new technical assistant, Paula Murphy (Julia Stiles), who is bringing the materials for the presentation, arrives 45 minutes late, and afterward Julie angrily fires her. But at the dreaded top-level meeting Julie is shocked to find herself promoted instead of fired. After decades of working her way up the ladder, she is finally No. 1. Later at the hotel bar she runs into Paula, and over many celebratory Scotches the two women develop an edgy friendship that takes an unexpected turn when Nick appears and Paula persuades Julie to invite him back to her suite for a possible threesome. 
The fun and games turn nasty when Paula confides to Julie that she has met Nick before, although he seems not to recognize her. At a party several years ago, Paula says, Nick raped her best friend. Outraged, Julie agrees against her better judgment to collaborate in a booze-fueled revenge improvised by Paula that becomes increasingly sadistic and ends up risking everything to vent a lifetime of pent-up rage against the male-dominated corporate pecking order. The scary, out-of-control punishment the two women wreak is complicated by the ambiguous sexual crosscurrents flowing between them. 
''The Business of Strangers'' has been described as the female answer to ''In the Company of Men,'' Neil LaBute's scorching satire in which two male office mates cruelly take out their accumulated rage on an innocent young woman by aggressively courting, then brutally dumping her. Where ''The Business of Strangers'' raises many of the same lurking demons, it isn't as incisive or as controlled as its forerunner, which had the impeccable structure of a modern Restoration comedy. In addressing date rape, this film also misses the note-perfect tone of Stephen Belber's screenplay for ''Tape.'' 
The problem with ''The Business of Strangers'' is that it doesn't know where to draw the line. At first Paula appears to be a nervy young truth teller whose contemptuous view of corporate life and the role of women seems precociously embittered. But as Paula's revenge escalates in viciousness, two surprise twists in the story make us question her credibility, and it appears she might be deranged. Her metamorphosis from ultra-cool to possibly insane recalls the transformation undergone by Glenn Close's lethal stalker in ''Fatal Attraction,'' although the two characters' sexual agendas are almost diametrically opposed. 
Ms. Stiles, with her small, deep-set eyes (reminiscent of Ms. Close's) and Jane Fonda voice, imbues Paula with a formidable, ultimately frightening bravado. Ms. Stiles brings a focused intelligence and vocal command to her portrayal that suggest she is the actress of her generation most likely to inherit the kind of powerhouse roles associated with Ms. Close and Ms. Fonda in their 30's and 40's. 
Ms. Channing's complicated, finely layered performance looks deep into Julie's soul. Where a less sensitive interpretation might have made the character a pitiably lonely career woman (single, menopausal, childless and terminally hard-boiled), Ms. Channing allows us to admire Julie's strength, poise and sense of accomplishment. As tough and bruised as she may be, Julie is no man-hating dragon lady. When Paula savagely baits her about the choices she has made in her life, Julie convincingly stands up for herself. 
Mr. Weller's Nick, far from being a cartoonish male chauvinist, is a glittering-eyed reptilian smoothie who keeps his cards close to his vest and conveys the wary charm of a conniving predator who is far less secure than he pretends. 
The film's performances are matched in power by its surreal, hellish vision of corporate life as an impersonal killing field in which the wounds are camouflaged by a suffocating blandness. Most of the movie is set in airport waiting rooms awash in stale canned music and anonymous hotel suites whose well-stocked minibars glint with inviting anesthetics. 
The paved-over suburban wasteland in which the movie takes place is everywhere and nowhere in America. The hotel itself is a hideous tower of greenish glass blocks looming incongruously against the sky. In the airport waiting room and hotel bar you feel the gaping distance between people who sit alone, blank-faced and brooding, in a kind of purgatorial void. When human contact takes place, the language is either harsh, impersonal corporate-speak or the raucous alcoholic camaraderie of nervously competitive men in packs. 
With an intensity that few movies have mustered, ''The Business of Strangers'' makes you feel the acute loneliness of it all, the empty pit-of-your-stomach feeling of being lost on the road in a world of masks with only your own ambition and gnawing paranoia for companionship. 
''The Business of Strangers'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual situations. 
‽
‽Ocean's Eleven‽,‽IT would be hard to make a movie worse than the first ''Ocean's Eleven,'' the 1960 Lewis Milestone film. Who remembers that it was the man responsible for the powerful, dogmatic antiwar film ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' who was being led around by the ring-a-ding leader of the Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra? 
Steven Soderbergh, who directed the remake, understood that all he had to do was show some finesse and he could get away with this low-blood-pressure heist picture, keeping the tiny germ of a story about hitting three Las Vegas casinos. Still, he rallies a seismic jolt of enthusiasm, and the movie is an elating blaze of flair and pride. 
Mr. Soderbergh has assembled a cast list that reads like a Who's Who of People magazine's Sexiest Men Alive: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia.  And as the Girl there's the biggest star of them all, Julia Roberts. For a little dramatic tension in the alphabetical above-the-title credits, her name comes last. This listing may be the closest thing to actual tension the film provides moviegoers, since Mr. Soderbergh is not about to dilute the good will his extraordinarily charismatic cast seduces out of the audience. 
The director comes through, too, by investing the film with his considerable skills. He must have realized this would be a delicate task; the film is a misstep away from Hal Needham's ''Cannonball Run,'' which Mr. Soderbergh has joked about in interviews as a movie in which the cast members enjoyed themselves and spared audiences any such delight. (The biggest question in the original ''Ocean's Eleven'' was not whether the thieves would succeed with the score, but whether they could get through the movie with a straight face.) 
Mr. Clooney, the logical heir to Sinatra's private-jet charm, portrays Danny Ocean, Chairman of the Bored. Sinatra, who played Ocean the first time around, may have been the first jazz actor, but he never showed the attention span to go with the talent. Mr. Clooney does. His line readings are choice: he never raises his voice, which is all velvet arrogance with a minimum of fuss. 
While being shown out of prison at the beginning of the film, he is reissued the garb he was wearing when arrested: a tuxedo, which looks as if the prison folks were nice enough to have cleaned and pressed. (Wisely, the movie cuts a dialogue exchange that remains in the trailer and television spots, in which Ocean insults the parole board.) 
He finds his ex-partner, Rusty (Mr. Pitt), teaching poker to hot young actors, playing themselves: Shane West, Joshua Jackson and Topher Grace, whose turn as a spoiled, jabbering, coddled crackhead in Mr. Soderbergh's ''Traffic'' last year may have been the only unheralded exercise of talent in the picture. This slight joke is a tutorial on star power to the youths trying to occupy the grown-up space that comes easily to Danny and Rusty. 
Danny plans to steal the take from three casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Mr. Garcia), a store of cash with security to rival that of ''most nuclear missile silos.'' Danny also wants to get the attention of his ex-wife, Tess (Ms. Roberts), who works for Benedict and is involved with him. Danny needs a team for this mammoth job, which will call for an assortment of cons to set up the robbery itself. 
This ''Ocean's Eleven'' may want to distance itself from the original, but it's crammed with not-so-subtle throwbacks to the Rat Pack, like the picture's tag line, ''Are you in or out?,'' a riff on the koo-koo cool of the Pack and a variation on a line Mr. Clooney uses. (The first ''Ocean's Eleven'' did have one gorgeous flourish: a map of the casinos to be hit was painted on a swath of silk.) 
Of course, both films are really about the same thing: manicured, superbly outfitted masculinity. One gets the feeling Rusty wouldn't need to be a part of the robbery if he didn't slip into a new piece of couture fabulosity three times a day, which coincides with the unspoken code of the 1960 version. Still, Mr. Pitt never does so well as when he is lingering around the comic criminal demimonde; making fun of his own narcissism in ''Snatch'' and ''True Romance'' is a bright joke. And here, in every scene he's in, he's munching on junk food like fries or popcorn. 
The cast is having a gas, and the actors who play for broad comedy hit their targets hard and repeatedly. As Reuben Tishkoff, a macher who has reasons of his own for getting back at Benedict, Elliott Gould looks, and acts, like a borscht belt bear. (His brassy intonations are reminiscent of the Linda Richman character Mike Myers used to do on ''Saturday Night Live.'') 
Carl Reiner is the curdled, retired hood Saul Bloom, and he peppers his performance with a disgust that looks as if it's powered by heartburn. Eddie Jemison, a find from Mr. Soderbergh's underseen ''Schizopolis,'' is a jittery electronics expert -- one of several, apparently. 
And as a screen actor, the comic Bernie Mac gets better and better. As Frank Catton, card dealer and scam artist, he has trimmed away his stand-up act's noisy busyness and holds his own; he bristles with authority. 
Some of the other, bigger talents are marooned by the material. Don Cheadle's demolition expert is dressed as if he'll later be disc jockeying at an underground club. He takes on a slipshod cockney accent that goes in and out; you wait to hear that it's a put-on. 
And Mr. Damon is supposed to be the Kid. (He is the youngest of the group, though not much younger than Mr. Pitt or Mr. Clooney.) He tries to connote youth by crimping his own style. With the really young actors used as a joke earlier in the film, it's almost as if the movie is trying to put Mr. Damon in the same uncomfortable position as Robert Redford in ''The Sting'' when he was too old to play the Kid role. (It might have been more fun to have seen Mr. Grace in this role.) 
Mr. Damon does light it up in a scene with Mr. Mac, but he and Ms. Roberts get to have the least fun because they have to show more maturity. Her schoolmarmish role seems almost an afterthought to compensate for the original's no-girls-allowed misogyny. 
This movie is an odd choice for Mr. Soderbergh, who is perhaps the ne plus ultra director of films about people living on the margins. His debut, ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' was so much about outsiders that one of its characters pressed a video camera to the window instead of his nose. I'm not sure why he chose to remake ''Ocean's Eleven,'' a movie so much about insiders that the stars of the original couldn't have cared less if there was an audience for the picture. And as it turns out, there wasn't much of one for the original, a ''Rififi'' swaddled in sharkskin and platinum slave bracelets. 
Mr. Soderbergh seems to make a different-looking movie on each occasion he gets behind the camera, though he does fall back on the stuttered, elided edits purloined from Jean-Luc Godard's splintered cuts. (He is as intrigued by playing around with time as Mr. Godard is, and does so here by layering the film with flashbacks.) 
But Mr. Soderbergh does some of his best work in ''Ocean's Eleven,'' working with a ticking suavity he tried to bring to lesser movies like ''The Underneath.'' 
He has a breathtaking amount of technique at his fingertips, aided immensely by the popping freshness of the score by David Holmes, who he worked with successfully on ''Out of Sight.'' Mr. Holmes scales his rhythms to the picture's pace, giving the movie a heartbeat. 
Mr. Soderbergh's cinematography adds a candy-colored snap; the tints come out of a pack of Jolly Ranchers. The color scheme balances the bland phoniness of the current Vegas, which functions as a welcome mat for all ages in contrast with the old-school menace of the city, a Fifth Amendment playground. (It may be why Sinatra wanted the original to have a downer ending it didn't earn.) 
The remake takes on a breeziness that trumps its vacancy; it's the world's largest hollow chocolate bunny. The city's own inauthenticity dovetails neatly with the picture's shiny artifice. 
This film is so brazenly showbizzy that everyone seems to be in costume. It depends on hard work and movie star combustion and gets by because the actors bring verve and professionalism to the enterprise. 
That they're better than the lackluster material isn't a given, and you may end up trying to fight their considerable charms. But even those potentially repelled by the in-jokes and raffishness may go along. 
For those not so taken by the star power, this new ''Ocean's Eleven'' is the equivalent of a domineering team you can't stand that enters the Super Bowl. Even if you don't like the players, the odds are so good that it's tough to bet against them. 
''Ocean's Eleven'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for cool-for-cats strong language, violence as fake as the shag carpeting and low-ball visual jokes.

‽
‽Texas Rangers‽,‽''Let them remember us not as men of vengeance but as men of law and justice.'' This noble sentiment, punctuated by a heart-rending tubercular cough, is intoned by Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), brave leader of the Texas Rangers, near the end of Steve Miner's movie of that name. The rangers themselves may be worthy of commemoration, but this violent meatball western deserves to be forgotten quickly, which seems to be just what its distributor, Dimension Films, had in mind when it snuck the movie into theaters yesterday with no advance screening. 
McNelly's words are an absurd, belated attempt to have it both ways. Even as it wags a finger at vigilantism and half-heartedly endorses due process, ''Texas Rangers'' is an orgy of revenge killing under the badge of legal authority on the wild Texas-Mexico border in 1875. 
McNelly is a downcast, shadow-faced ex-preacher who lost his family to bandits and who, as head of the rangers, favors summary executions and disdains taking prisoners. One ranger, a bookish man named Lincoln Rogers Dunnison (James Van Der Beek), is troubled by his methods. By the end each has learned something: Dunnison can enjoy plugging the bad hombre who killed his parents, and McNelly can, after killing many bad guys himself, consider the virtues of a fair trial. 
The moral of ''Texas Rangers'' is as confused as everything else in it. Mr. Miner and his screenwriters throw in enough horse-opera clichés to shame the makers of ''Gunsmoke.'' There are a few modern twists, of course, like the casting of almost-hot young television and pop music talent in the heartthrob roles. 
In addition to Mr. Van Der Beek, the title character in ''Dawson's Creek,'' there is Ashton Kutcher of ''That 70's Show'' and the R&amp;B singer Usher Raymond. Mr. Raymond plays Randolph Douglas Scipio, the only black in the ranger company. 
The rangers are after a bad hombre named John King Fisher, gleefully played by Alfred Molina. His gang kidnaps a character described in the production notes as ''the smoldering Perdita.'' 
Rachael Leigh Cook embodies chaste and sensible Texas womanhood and surprises Mr. Van Der Beek and Mr. Kutcher in a bathtub together. (I wish it were as interesting as it sounds.) At the end she stands at the grave of some rangers and says, ''I can't help but think they're watching.'' Well, if somebody has to, it's better them than you. 
''Texas Rangers'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a lot of killing and some mild cowboy swearing.

‽The Affair of the Necklace‽,‽According to no less an authority than Napoleon Bonaparte, the events related in ''The Affair of the Necklace,'' a new movie directed by Charles Shyer, were among the main causes of the French Revolution. You will have to take Napoleon's word for it, since this swooshy, bejewelled period melodrama sheds precious little light on the political history of France. This in itself need not be a major failing, since movies set in the 18th century have much to offer besides historical instruction -- women in tight bodices, men in wigs, and elegantly turned-out people laughing uproariously at remarks that don't sound, to our vulgar modern ears, funny at all. 
''The Affair of the Necklace'' has all of these things, and enough velvet and brocade to swath every bosom from here to Versailles, where its plot unfolds in the expected atmosphere of aristocratic decadence. The court is ruled by the haughty, naughty Marie Antoinette (Joely Richardson), whose favor our heroine, one Jeanne de la Motte-Valois (Hilary Swank), most ardently desires. Most ardently indeed! (This, by the way, was how people talked in the 18th century.) 
By the efficient use of printed titles, voice-over narration, a childhood flashback and several long speeches, it is established that Jeanne was robbed of her birthright and her parents by royal soldiers. She arrives at the court of Louis XVI clutching a copy of her family tree and hoping that her title, honor and property will be restored. A dashing young gigolo named Retaux de la Villette (Simon Baker) comes to her aid, and together they hatch the scheme that gives the movie its title. 
To put briefly what Mr. Shyer and the screenwriter, John Sweet, put as laboriously as possible, Jeanne forges a series of letters from Marie Antoinette to the lecherous Cardinal Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), who desperately wants to be prime minister. Jeanne soon finds herself the prime mover of a vast conspiracy that includes not only herself and Villette, but also her dissolute husband, Nicolas (Adrien Brody), and the shady Cagliostro, a Rasputin-like figure who is reputed to be the head of the German Illuminati and who could be played only by Christopher Walken. The necklace itself is a ravishing bauble designed by the royal jewelers for the ill-fated neck of Marie Antoinette, and it becomes the prize in Jeanne's ruthless long con. 
All of this could be quite entertaining, either in the swashbuckling ''Three Musketeers'' vein -- there is a brief interlude of swordplay -- or in the erotic chess-match mode of ''Dangerous Liaisons.'' But the filmmakers' interest in the fashion and furniture of the era never extends to politics, sexual mores or social life, and what is worse, they are unable to wrest a coherent story from the historical record. ''The Affair of the Necklace'' drags and meanders when it wants clarity and clockwork, and bogs down in hazy, vague emotions. 
The biggest problem is in the character of Jeanne herself. To have conceived a plot that involved the manipulation of two powerful figures and to have dared to put it into action must have required a degree of calculation and sang-froid that never registers in Ms. Swank's performance. She and Mr. Shyer are so intent on making Jeanne sympathetic -- that flashback of the soldiers sacking her childhood home and killing her father is repeated several times throughout the movie -- that she seems more like a trembling victim than an ingenious plotter. 
To rise above the ridiculousness of the material would have required figuring out how to make Jeanne into a heroine, and Ms. Swank has a timid, indecisive manner that shrinks the character. With her angular cheekbones and wide lips, she looks a little like Julia Roberts, but she utterly lacks Ms. Roberts's reckless movie-star sass. 
The earnest ineptitude of the picture makes it all the more painful to watch gifted actors like Mr. Pryce and Brian Cox, who plays the scowling House Minister Breteuil, waste gravity and conviction on roles that could be saved only by parody. Mr. Pryce, who has been making something of a habit of bad costume drama, glowers and sighs and quite literally rips a bodice, shortly after dismounting from a galloping horse, no less, and yet he seems to take no pleasure in any of it. 
The only actors who relieve the tedium are the ones who decline to take the proceedings seriously. Mr. Brody overacts with a loose bravado somewhere between Tom Jones and Blackadder, and reminds us that all that lechery and dissolution could be fun sometimes. And then there is Mr. Walken, who seems to be enjoying himself a great deal at the movie's expense. He is outfitted with facial hair that appears to have been made of industrial vinyl and a hairdo that owes more to science fiction than to costume drama. Every time the camera moves his way, it seems to interrupt a deep reverie, and as soon as Mr. Walken opens his mouth your overwhelming impulse is to burst out laughing. 
As he did last summer in ''America's Sweethearts,'' Mr. Walken imports a deep mischief that this dim, hesitant picture cannot contain. If no studio will back a sequel devoted to the adventures of Cagliostro, maybe Spike Jonze or the good people at ''Saturday Night Live,'' who have made good use of Mr. Walken's anarchic sense of comedy in the past, will find a home for him. 
''The Affair of the Necklace'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are some violent scenes, and several ripped and otherwise unfastened bodices.

‽
‽Behind Enemy Lines‽,‽''Behind Enemy Lines,'' a taut wartime rescue thriller that sustains a relentless buzzing energy, feels very much of the moment, even though it is set in the Balkans and not in Afghanistan. 
Directed by John Moore, from a screenplay by David Veloz and Zak Penn, it provides about as intense an immersion in military ambience as a Hollywood movie could hope to provide in just over 90 minutes. Even with its occasional lapses into melodramatic fakery, its cool, machine-tooled mixture of jargon, gadgetry, offhanded machismo and war-is-hell imagery feels far more authentic than in most Hollywood war movies. 
Without excessive flag-waving or patriotic bluster, ''Behind Enemy Lines'' plays into the new spirit of gung-ho militancy that has swept the nation since Sept. 11. Its two heroes, Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), a talented naval aviator, and his commander, Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman), who leads the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson, are seasoned military men, each with a renegade streak. When the going gets tough, both are willing to risk their careers to defy authority. 
Although the movie is basically a cut-and-dried thriller, it sends an implicit message that blind obedience to military command isn't always the best policy and that a judicious flouting of the rules is sometimes the nobler choice. 
As the story begins, the war in Bosnia is winding to a close. A joint coalition of American and NATO forces is overseeing the cease-fire. In a few days the Americans are scheduled to leave the area. 
The NATO commander, Admiral Piquet (Joaquim de Almeida), although sharing the same rank with Reigart, is technically his superior, and a subplot of the movie follows the personal power struggle between the two that has subtle global implications. 
Reigart and Burnett have their own conflicts. Burnett, who has served in the Navy for eight years without seeing any action, has reluctantly decided to leave military service out of sheer boredom and frustration. Reigart is disappointed about the prospect of losing his best naval aviator, and as punishment, on Christmas Eve, he dispatches Burnett and a pilot, Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), on the kind of routine, usually fruitless reconnaissance mission that Burnett has flown many times before. 
This time, however, Burnett spots some suspicious activity on the ground and decides to fly outside his authorized airspace to photograph it. His plane is immediately shot down, and Burnett and Stackhouse escape by parachute. From the edge of the woods where his chute lands, Burnett watches in horror as Stackhouse is surrounded, captured and summarily executed by Serbian soldiers. Burnett's half-stifled shout of horror at the killing alerts the soldiers to his presence, and he becomes the object of a manhunt that takes up most of the rest of the movie. 
As Burnett makes his way across the rugged wintry terrain toward a safe area, he is pursued by Serbian gunmen. But he is also able to establish radio contact with Reigart, who overrides Piquet's instructions and dispatches a rescue party. 
It's all in the details, as they say. And while ''Behind Enemy Lines'' has no ideas or philosophy to speak of in its adrenaline-fueled head, it conveys a steady visceral charge from its opening moments to its predictably triumphal finale. As Burnett scuttles through the forest, you feel his continually changing chemistry of panic, exhilaration and determination. In the movie's most gruesome moment, his only hope for survival is to bury himself in mud and play dead in a ditch festooned with rotting corpses. 
The jittery action scenes, filmed with hand-held cameras, are so realistic that some of movie's computerized special effects, while deployed with unusual deftness, still seem artificial and ultimately unnecessary. 
The sense of realism is immeasurably bolstered by the performances of the two leads. The choice of Mr. Wilson, who has starred in three Wes Anderson films, might seem an odd one. But the young actor's eccentricities help humanize his character, and you sense the streak of the wild, reckless good ol' boy in Burnett that helps make him a natural fighter. 
Here, as in almost every movie in which he appears, Mr. Hackman is a natural. With no visible effort, he infuses his rather stock character with a complex personal psychology. Stoic and hard-bitten on the surface but passionately independent underneath and devoted to the welfare of his men, he may be close to an ideal commander. But Mr. Hackman's understated performance emphasizes Reigart's thorniness, stubbornness and isolation. Even in the most ring-a-ding-ding moments of triumph, the actor refuses to let even the tiniest hint of grandiosity or sentimentality taint his performance. He is as tough  and comfortable as well-worn leather. 
''Behind Enemy Lines'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and scenes of violence.

‽
‽Spy Game‽,‽Many of Tony Scott's movies -- ''Top Gun,'' ''Crimson Tide,'' ''Enemy of the State,'' and now ''Spy Game'' -- are like gadgets in the Sharper Image catalog: sleek, expensive handsome gizmos of doubtful utility. Mr. Scott has an eye for sharp images and cool stuff, and his new movie has the pointless, thrilling kineticism of a sports car commercial. (Perhaps the director has not been recruited by BWM to make one of its high-concept Internet promo films because the project would be, in his case, redundant.) 
''Spy Game'' is seamlessly and crisply edited, a fast-moving collage of global architecture, top-secret documents and murky skulduggery with an accompanying soundtrack of world music and classic rock. Like a hot game of paint ball or a midsize sedan with sporty trim and a spoiler on the back, the movie provides a vehicle for macho romanticism, a fantasy of danger and derring-do for the deskbound. 
As such it provides its share of fun. Robert Redford, a cagey twinkle in his blue eyes, plays Nathan Muir, a maverick C.I.A. officer whose long, shadowy career is at its end: the movie tracks the hectic 24 hours before his retirement. ''I'm old school,'' Nathan says, applying hip-hop terminology to intelligence work. That he's not referring to the button-down, Ivy League agency of the early cold war era is evident in Nathan's appearance. His tweed sports coat, tortoise-shell glasses and shaggy blond hair mark him, amid the dark suits and rep ties of his snotty younger colleagues, as a man of the 70's, and it helps that he is embodied by one of that decade's leading male movie stars. 
Curiously, ''Spy Game'' is the second movie released this season in which Mr. Redford has seemed to revisit, and slyly revise, an earlier performance. His role in ''The Last Castle,'' Rod Lurie's chest-thumping prison melodrama, could not help but recall the beleaguered reform-minded warden he played in ''Brubaker.'' 
Nathan, with his laid-back sarcasm and his donnish fashion sense, recalls Joe Turner, the C.I.A. analyst Mr. Redford played in ''Three Days of the Condor'' in 1975. Turner was like a hip graduate student hemmed in by a malignant bureaucracy. Nathan is more like a weathered old rebel with tenure whose department is taken over by sharp-faced careerists like Harker (Stephen Dillane), a colleague who turns out to be Nathan's nemesis. 
Mr. Redford's easy white-bread  charm has always had an enigmatic dimension. (Who else could have played Jay Gatsby?) And here he plays a man whose relaxed familiarity conceals an absolute inscrutability. The sense that his character departs the movie in possession of secrets he hasn't told -- even the filmmakers may not be aware of what he knows -- nearly saves ''Spy Game'' from its dumb, overworked obviousness. 
Most of the picture takes place in 1991, when the C.I.A.'s main concern seems to be staying out of the way while a trade agreement is negotiated with China. Nathan speaks contemptuously of the agency's post-cold war mission -- ''it's about money,'' he sneers -- looking back fondly on the days when the C.I.A. stood for something loftier. 
What exactly that was is left purposely vague, but the long flashbacks that pad out the movie's running time and vary its visual texture paint a picture that is neither pretty nor coherent. As Nathan spends his last day on the job racing the clock and outwitting his superiors, we are led on a nostalgia tour of foreign policy hot spots, from Vietnam in 1975 to Berlin a few years later to Beirut in the mid-80's, when Nathan had served his ideals by assassinating politicians and hiring a Lebanese militia to drive a suicide truck bomb into a Beirut hotel. 
The point of these reminiscences is to explore the relationship between Nathan and Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), a hotheaded young idealist whom the older man recruited into the agency and who now awaits execution in a Chinese prison. The agency brass clearly wants to let him die, and Nathan, who in the past lived by a utilitarian code that allowed him to sacrifice other people's lives without compunction, decides to save him. 
In some ways ''Spy Game'' recalls another Redford picture from the 70's, ''The Way We Were,'' but with Mr. Pitt in the Barbra Streisand role. The initial affinity between Nathan and Tom -- with their period hair and aviator glasses they could be a Me Decade Dorian Gray and his walking portrait -- is strained by an ethical quarrel. Tom objects to his mentor's ruthless indifference to human life, which strikes the older man as evidence of fatal naïveté. They hash this out in various picturesque settings, including on a domed rooftop in Berlin, where someone has thoughtfully placed a table and chairs and where an airborne camera cyclones around them. 
All the geopolitics turns out of course to be window dressing for an absurd sentimentality, as Tom, midway through the Beirut operation, falls in love with an British foreign-aid worker (Catherine McCormack). The sufferings of the world don't amount to a hill of beans next to the lives of two good-looking people. This in itself is too familiar to be bothersome, but there is something obscene in the casual way Mr. Scott uses the images of maimed children in a Lebanese refugee camp, to say nothing of that truck bomb. 
The problem lies in the calculating pretentiousness of using human misery to make shallow entertainment seem serious. It's worth comparing ''Spy Game'' with ''The Tailor of Panama,'' John Boorman's far superior exercise in post-cold-war spycraft, which was sadly overlooked when it was released earlier this year. In treating the decline of old-school espionage satirically Mr. Boorman shed more light on the intersection of human ambitions and world politics than Mr. Scott, with his square-jawed bravura, can manage. 
''Spy Game'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some profanity, sexual situations and graphic violence.

‽
‽Black Knight‽,‽The funniest scene in the innocuous new Martin Lawrence comedy ''Black Knight'' reworks a surefire formula that has perked up dozens of otherwise routine comedies since the birth of rock 'n' roll: a pied piper of hip brings funky rhythm to the squares who spring to their feet, unable to resist the call of the wild. The messenger of the big beat in this case is a disgruntled theme park employee, Jamal Walker (Mr. Lawrence), who toils grumpily at Medieval World, a dilapidated outdoor fantasy kingdom rapidly heading for the junk heap. 
When Jamal accidentally tumbles into the park's filthy castle moat, he finds himself magically transported to England in the year 1328. After a series of silly mishaps he ends up court jester to the despotic King Leo (Kevin Conway). When commanded to demonstrate some Norman dances (Jamal has been passing himself off as a messenger from Normandy), he flounders around gawkily until an idea hits him. Approaching the court musicians, he prompts them into becoming an acoustic funk band. Before you know it, everyone is gyrating madly to a quasi-medieval arrangement (and quite contemporary-sounding version) of Sly and the Family Stone's ''Dance to the Music.'' 
The entire movie is itself a formula: another variation of ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' (with a nod to ''The Wizard of Oz''). This edition comes with hip-hop flavoring and a mild antiracist message. Jamal takes umbrage whenever he hears himself disdainfully referred to as ''the Moor.'' 
The star, who wears a football jersey through much of the movie, appears to be having a good time. But if Mr. Lawrence is an amiable enough screen presence, he is no comic wizard. The imperious, lethal parodies of Eddie Murphy or Jim Carrey are way beyond him. His energy is more roly-poly than slash and burn. Instead of snapping and crackling, it detonates in gentle pops. Mr. Lawrence belongs to the shambling-everyman, Adam Sandler school of cocky but klutzy dumb-like-a-fox bozos. If, when insulted, he is perfectly capable of giving as good as he gets, he doesn't seem to have a killer instinct. It's not necessary for him to slay an adversary; it's enough merely to stun him. 
''Black Knight'' has plot to burn. On arriving in England, Jamal's first encounter is with Knolte (Tom Wilkinson), an alcoholic knight whose life he saves with a timely administration of artificial respiration (an opportunity for some bad-breath jokes). Later in the movie Knolte is revealed to be a leader of a liberating army, which Jamal joins and in whose service he executes some mostly accidental heroics. 
His fiercest opponent both in the battle and for the attentions of Victoria, a beautiful chambermaid and rebel leader (Marsha Thomason), is snobbish, flinty-eyed Percival (Vincent Regan). When Percival tosses out the word ''Moor,'' it is delivered with the supercilious edge of a preppie brat. 
The sight gags that parody ''A Connecticut Yankee'' tend to fall flat. In one scene, as Jamal is about to be executed, he tries to save himself by claiming to be sorcerer who can conjure fire and pulls out a cigarette lighter. But we already have fire, comes the retort. The comic action sequences try for sharp farcical spoof but fall short. Pressured to ride a horse, Jamal finds himself dragged around by the animal but saves face by treating his ineptitude as a jester's entertainment. The sequence barely taps the situation's comic potential. The climactic battle sequences are chaotically goofy without being much fun. 
The film, directed by Gil Junger, has its predicable quota of off-color humor. Jamal is shocked, just shocked, by 14th-century sanitation and table manners. He lands in deep trouble when the king's sexually aggressive daughter sneaks into his bed and comports herself like a ''freak.'' 
''Black Knight'' is a movie that knows its audience. Its underlying philosophy might be: why try harder when this is all they expect? 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has gross-out humor, some strong language and sexual situations.

‽Out Cold‽,‽When the masters of the drive-in movie at American-International Pictures ran out of ideas for beach party films in the early 60's, they came up with ''Ski Party,'' a 1965 production that simply transferred the eternal themes of the beach genre -- revealing clothing, practical jokes and uncertainty over how far to go in sex and romance in the absence of adult supervision -- to the side of a mountain. 
That memorable creative choice now has its descendant in ''Out Cold,'' a ski party movie in which the clothes are a little more revealing than they were 35 years ago, the practical jokes are a little more tasteless, and the uncertainty over sex is pretty much nonexistent. Most crucial, instead of surfboards there are snowboards. 
But the character types remain the same. The population of Bull Mountain, a ragtag ski resort somewhere in Alaska (but filmed somewhere in Canada), consists of the handsome but heart-broken Rick (Jason London, a Brendan Fraser look-alike), his three goofy, substance-abusing pals (Zach Galifianakis, Flex Alexander and Derek Hamilton), the sweet blond girl with a crush on Rick (A. J. Cook), the exotic French girl whom Rick mistakenly prefers (Caroline Dhavernas), a pompous adult authority figure suitable for ritual humiliation (Lee Majors) and a free-ranging former Playmate of the Month (Victoria Silvstedt, Miss December of 1996). 
The plot, such as it is, kicks in when Mr. Majors's character, imaginatively named Mr. Majors, tries to take over Bull Mountain and transform it into Snownook, a prim and proper family resort with upscale coffee, a uniformed staff and countless other offenses to the ski bum sensibility. Such tyranny must not stand. 
''Out Cold'' was directed by yet another pair of filmmaking brothers, Brendan and Emmett Malloy, who seem to have carefully studied the work of their fraternal predecessors. From Bobby and Peter Farrelly, they have inherited the ski-slope slapstick and bathroom humor of ''Dumb and Dumber,'' and from Chris and Paul Weitz (''American Pie'') the Malloys have borrowed their characters' amusing tendency to have sex with inanimate objects (in this case, the air jets of a Jacuzzi). 
As in the old beach movies, a great deal of screen time is devoted to the astounding exploits of stunt doubles, who here are riding powdered snow rather than waves. The Malloys offer a few demonstrations of amazing grace and skill, but mostly the ski scenes consist of spectacular wipe-outs as obviously painful as they are obviously real. Ouch. 
''Out Cold'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for its strong language, crude humor and scenes of drug and alcohol use.

‽
‽Sidewalks of New York‽,‽Surely, after everything this city has been through, the time is right for a breezy, captivating New York romantic comedy. ''Sidewalks of New York'' is not an especially good movie, but it will do. Edward Burns, who wrote, directed and stars, has an evident and specific fondness for Manhattan: the slightly insecure romanticism of a migrant from the outer boroughs or the near suburbs. This sentiment is most clearly expressed by Mr. Burns's character, a television producer named Tommy, who comes from Queens. 
His real estate agent Annie (Heather Graham), a native Upper East Sider, says his origin makes him something less than a real New Yorker. Tommy's response to her unthinking snobbery is to recite his family history: grandfathers who toiled as sandhogs and construction workers, a police officer father and a mother who is a nurse. The speech is perhaps a little contrived, but it is touching and genuine and captures what is best about the movie. 
As an actor, Mr. Burns has an easy charm tinged with an aggression that seems rooted in class resentment. In his eagerness to show that he's a nice guy, he suggests that his niceness has limits. Annie, miserably married to Griffin (Stanley Tucci), a philandering dentist, is not Tommy's only love interest. For much of the movie he conducts a hesitant romance with Maria (Rosario Dawson), a divorced schoolteacher. The movie's most understated scene is a confrontation in the hallway outside Maria's apartment between Tommy and Ben, her ex-husband, a boyish doorman who cuts an unimposing figure in his tan uniform and green hooded parka. Even though Ben longs to reunite with Maria, to whom he was unfaithful, he is increasingly smitten with Ashley (Brittany Murphy), a waitress having an affair with that same dentist. 
''Sidewalks'' bobs and weaves through this geometry of interlocking triangles, punctuating dates and arguments with mock interviews, in which the characters face the camera and muse on the complexities of love, sex and fidelity. 
Tommy and Maria meet in a video store, where they both want to rent the same movie. Later, we find out it was ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' but in preparing for his fourth venture in filmmaking Mr. Burns seems to have run up enormous late fees on Woody Allen's ''Husbands and Wives.'' He has appropriated not only that film's narrative structure but also its visual technique, sending his hand-held camera hurtling down one apartment hallway after another. For some reason -- too much coffee, perhaps, or too many episodes of ''Homicide'' -- he peppers his scenes with jump cuts. To complement this visual stuttering, the dialogue is full of pauses, repetitions and bursts of profanity. These stylistic noodlings are no doubt meant to mimic the syncopated rhythms of urban life and speech, but instead they expose the weakness of the story and script. 
''Sidewalks of New York'' is like a Woody Allen movie without the intellectual pretension, which is mostly a good thing. But Mr. Burns is a little too comfortable with the limits of his imagination and strangely uninterested in his own characters. The six move through their rondelay without credible motive, their various attractions assumed rather than explained. Their behavior toward one another seems almost random, obeying no emotional logic. 
Griffin is so evidently a narcissistic lout, bad in bed and unpleasant to be with, that it's hard to understand what either Annie or Ashley are doing with him. The other characters, while much more likable, are so thinly drawn that it's hard, a few minutes after leaving the theater, to recall anything they did or said. 
Though it fails to be very interesting, ''Sidewalks of New York,'' like the people who populate Mr. Burns's New York, is impossible to dislike. If it's not especially funny, it is appealingly good-humored, and the actors perform well within the limitations of the script. (Dennis Farina provides some comic relief as Tommy's boss, a leathery lothario who drinks martinis in his bubble bath and gives his protégé advice that sounds as if it were cribbed from the latest issue of Maxim.) 
Mr. Burns also deserves credit for avoiding the sudsy happily-ever-after clichés that deform so many contemporary romantic comedies. The view of love that emerges from ''Sidewalks,'' while it is not particularly deep or insightful, is refreshingly hard-headed without being altogether cynical. 
''Sidewalks of New York'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanities.

‽Shottas‽,‽Stars from reggae and other musical worlds give acting a try in “Shottas,” and it appears that most of them might actually be good at it. But they are trapped in such a witless, misogynistic, gratuitously violent, drug-culture-worshiping film that it’s impossible to say for certain. 
The featured attraction is Ky-Mani  Marley, a son of Bob, who has done some reggae recording but here tries out the role of a drug kingpin named Biggs. Spragga Benz, a dancehall star, plays Biggs’s childhood friend Wayne, and they get an early start on a life of crime, robbing a deliveryman to get money to flee Jamaica for Miami. 
We next see Biggs grown and back in Jamaica; he has logged time inside an American prison and then been deported. He and Wayne reunite and, with some pals, kill an assortment of Jamaicans, then return to Miami to try to kill their way back into drug-lordship there. 
“Shottas” (a Jamaican equivalent of gangster) is full of interesting performers in the smaller roles; the best known is probably Wyclef Jean, who also composed the movie’s music. But Cess Silvera, the film’s writer and director, doesn’t find any of the humanity or inner demons that would allow the characters to rise above B-movie exploitation. And even though almost everyone is dead by the end, make no mistake: This movie glorifies the drug trade and the contempt for life that it entails. Somehow these despicable thugs are surrounded by curvaceous, compliant women, who tend to be onscreen just long enough to bare their breasts, which promptly get bullet holes in them. 
“Shottas” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence, nudity, language and drug themes.

‽
‽Hell's Highway‽,‽The best way to see ''Hell's Highway,'' which opens today in Manhattan, might be on a double bill with ''2 Fast 2 Furious.'' Yes, one is a scholarly documentary and the other a dunderheaded action picture, but both, in their different ways, offer testimony to the love affair between the movie camera and the automobile. ''2 Fast'' celebrates the thrills of recklessness and speed, while ''Hell's Highway'' examines their grisly consequences. 
Or, rather, it examines the ways these have been examined, since the movie itself is not an exercise in cautionary driver's-ed cinema, but rather an exploration of that genre's golden age and greatest auteurs. You will not find their names in the film history textbooks, but the folks who worked for Highway Safety Films (later the Highway Safety Foundation) from the late 1950's to the mid-70's deserve at least a footnote, which Bret Wood, who put together this mélange of talking-head interviews and archival clips, is happy to provide. 
Highway Safety Films combined educational high-mindedness with an evident but unacknowledged ghoulishness. It was started by Richard Wayman, an Ohio accountant whose hobby was taking pictures of fatal car accidents. He soon gathered around him a group of like-minded citizens, including a police officer and a few insurance executives, who hit upon the idea of showing these shocking images to high school students to acquaint them with the horrible consequences of unsafe driving. They were, quite literally, ambulance chasers, but with a strong sense of civic mission. The ones who are still around to be interviewed are gray on top and thick around the middle, and they exude a plain-spoken, Midwestern practicality that makes their enterprise seem all the more bizarre. 
On hand to interpret it are a video distributor, who markets the movies as cult artifacts, and a professorial type who interprets them as ideological texts. The films themselves, with titles like ''Mechanized Death,'' ''Wheels of Tragedy'' and ''The Last Prom,'' may be technically crude, but their impact is undeniable. Real-life shots of smashed faces and twisted bodies, accompanied by a soundtrack of whimpers and moans, alternate with re-enactments, in which, canonically, the girl in the passenger seat begs her date to slow down, until finally her pleas become a scream of terror and the screen goes black to the sound of a shattering windshield. 
Some time is spent pondering the pedagogical effectiveness of such images, and more is spent poking into some odd corners of the Highway Safety story. A number of unsavory rumors attached themselves to the company: that it had a sideline in pornography, that one of the founders had been murdered, that it was tied to organized crime. But on the evidence of ''Hell's Highway,'' these seem to be urban legends. Still, the company did make a film, apparently intended to train police officers in video surveillance, that showed men having sex in public restrooms. It also distributed a movie called ''The Child Molester,'' which is so creepy and disturbing that you can hardly believe it was shown to first graders. (It was, and two of them, now grown up, appear on camera to testify to its traumatizing effects.) 
Since scaring children has gone out of fashion as a teaching tool, it seems only natural that these movies take on a queasy, nostalgic fascination. But the movie is agnostic about how much progress we have made. Nowadays, car safety films feature crash test dummies rather than bloody corpses, and automobile manufacturers are assigned a much greater responsibility for the well-being of their customers. Someday, perhaps, someone will make a documentary of Volvo commercials and Consumers Union test-drive videos, but I doubt it will be as unnerving -- or as much fun -- as ''Hell's Highway.'' 
''Hell's Highway: The True Story of Highway Safety Films'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), even though the films were originally intended to be shown to high school students. It has graphic images of mangled car-accident victims.

‽
‽Pinocchio‽,‽Miramax seems to be showing the same faith in Roberto Benigni's ''Pinocchio'' that the Republican Party showed in Trent Lott; the live-action version of Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the wooden puppet whose only ambition was to be a real live boy was sneaked into theaters Christmas Day. A recent -- very recent -- decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. 
That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over. There must have been such a rush to get the prints into theaters for the nationwide opening that no one bothered to check the lip-syncing. It's as if someone tried to hit a target with a can of paint. 
In this enchanted setting, ''a land where grown-ups can act like children,'' a magic log falls off a cart and disrupts an entire tiny town. It bounces into Geppetto's home-workshop, and he quickly says, ''You can be like the son I never had'' as he carves into it his idea of a little boy. I guess Geppetto doesn't get out much, because his idea of a child is a 40-ish man with a receding hairline, pancake makeup and 5 o'clock shadow: the Pinocchio he fashions is Mr. Benigni. (It's particularly galling as Pinocchio makes fun of Geppetto's blond hairpiece, which looks like the thatched roof of a hut.) ''You're made out of pine; I'll call you Pinocchio,'' Geppetto says, struggling to get a word in over Pinocchio's constant bleating. 
This movie is also a chunk of pine, but it's still awaiting the magic touch to transmute it into a real live movie. ''Pinocchio'' opens with the Blue Fairy (played by Nicoletta Braschi, voiced by Glenn Close) coming into a small town, riding a carriage pulled by a train of little white mice: an undulating river of full-moon-colored fur towing her along. It's one of the few splashes of wonderment -- courtesy of the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, and the production designer-magician, Danilo Donati -- in a picture that is mostly a desert of strangeness, a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes ''Battleship Earth'' and ''Showgirls.'' The heavy sighs of the few other people in the theater, who apparently had been paroled into the custody of the multiplex, were easily heard over the long, dead silences between Pinocchio-Benigni's chattering. 
Geppetto encourages Pinocchio to go to school, but he's not interested. When he is visited by a talking insect named Cricket (voice of John Cleese), who must have danced over from the magical land of copyright infringement, Pinocchio blathers, ''One job I want: the job of eating, drinking and playing.'' 
Cricket scolds Pinocchio so often with ''Serves you right'' over his misbehaving that the little creature begins to sound like a rehab counselor. The Blue Fairy keeps an eye on Pinocchio, listening to his promises to be good. He always lets her down, and she keeps coming back; the subtitle should be ''When Good Fairies Love Bad Puppets.'' 
Geppetto is a sucker for Pinocchio's word much longer than he should be, too, though their relationship is more obviously informed by delusion. It's hard to tell what's sadder, Geppetto's belief that Pinocchio is a child puppet or Mr. Benigni's need to play one. When he affectionately smooches Geppetto's face, it's like Jack playing out one of his outré fantasies on ''Will and Grace.'' 
Other scenes of unintentional innuendo can be found. While Pinocchio is pulling one of his many jail stretches for a crime he didn't commit -- he spends more time in manacles that Enron's senior executives -- one of his cellmates, another adult under the illusion that he's a boy, offers a lick of a lollipop that's ''the flavor of paradise.'' How did this movie get past the Motion Picture Association? 
Mr. Benigni's decision makes this ''Pinocchio'' as believable as Diana Ross playing Dorothy in ''The Wiz'' or Matthew McConaughey portraying a college graduate in ''Contact.'' The movie does follow Collodi's sweeping ebb and flow closely. 
Occasionally the inflation works well. The whale that swallows Pinocchio and Geppetto whole is now a great white shark. And when Pinocchio is swindled into joining a pack of party boys and is turned into a donkey, the scene in which he becomes a circus beast of burden borders on touching. That is, it would if there had been an actress other than Ms. Braschi, with her Mona Lisa inexpressiveness, watching the affair. (With her blue-gelatin hair, she looks like an older version of post-punker Siouxsie, from the Banshees.) 
It's an oddity that will be avoided by millions of people, this new ''Pinocchio.'' Osama bin Laden could attend a showing in Times Square and be confident of remaining hidden.

‽
‽Catch Me If You Can‽,‽Here in the land of opportunity, we pride ourselves on taking one another at face value. That's why in a culture that falls all over itself to invest glamorous images with substance, any quick-witted trickster can have a field day pretending to be what he's not. 
In the opening scene of ''Catch Me if You Can,'' Steven Spielberg's supremely entertaining portrait of a virtuoso impostor, its protagonist, Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), appears on ''To Tell the Truth,'' the archetypal television game show celebrating mendacity and fraud. Before his 19th birthday, the announcer proclaims, Frank successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and made millions of dollars forging checks. 
As the camera surveys the three contestants, there's Mr. DiCaprio in the middle, the faintest twinkle of mischief in his snaky eyes, his baby face gone playfully poker. Mr. DiCaprio's portrayal of this brilliant fraud is, in a word, sensational (and far more confident, by the way, than his stolid star turn in ''Gangs of New York''). An extraordinarily fluid and instinctive actor, Mr. DiCaprio has always conveyed the slippery acuity of a chameleon whiz kid who could talk his way in and out of any situation, and his performance is a glorious exhibition of artful, intuitive slipping, sliding and wriggling. 
In ''Catch Me if You Can,'' the 28-year-old actor melts into the body and mind of a wily, precocious teenager who turns himself into a master forger. Adding depth to his performance is the flashing intensity with which he conveys Frank's mercurial bouts of insecurity and panic. Even while his character is flying high, Mr. DiCaprio understands that Frank is a wounded boy, and the actor remains in intimate touch with the childish desperation behind his bravado. 
Initially at least, Frank's goal isn't a selfish urge to find a shortcut to the high life, but to recoup the standard of living lost by his larcenous father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), who is being hounded by the I.R.S. for tax fraud. The son also vaguely imagines that with enough money he can reunite his parents, who split up early in the movie. In the most poignant scene, a lawyer announces to the stunned youth that his parents are divorcing, and in the next breath insists he choose between them. Frank refuses and runs away from home to begin his career of kiting checks. 
A major strand of the film is a father-son love story, in which Frank hungrily absorbs his shady dad's lessons in deception, bribery and sweet talk. The chemistry between Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Walken (giving one of his strongest, most sympathetic screen performances) is so charged the two actors actually seem to share the same reptilian genes. 
''Catch Me if You Can'' moves in pirouetting leaps and dips that mirror its peripatetic antihero's shifting identities and changes of fortune. The game-show excerpt, which follows a cool-handed animated title sequence, sets the lighthearted tone of a movie that admires Frank almost to the point of suspending moral judgment. 
From here, the film hops over to France in 1969 to observe Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the strait-laced F.B.I. agent who has pursued Frank with a Javert-like persistence, confront him with the roster of criminal charges in a grim Marseille prison. Then it bounces back to 1963 in New Rochelle where the fresh-faced 15-year-old Frank and his French mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), are attending a cozy Rotary Club ceremony honoring Frank Sr., whose fortunes are about to take a dive. 
The film eventually makes stops in Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta and New Orleans. Some of the wittiest scenes find Frank engaged to an adoring airheaded nurse, Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), whom he meets during his brief career impersonating a doctor. He so charms her unctuous father, Roger (Martin Sheen), a New Orleans prosecutor, into imagining they're fellow romantics that Roger helps him establish a new identity as an assistant prosecutor. Frank's television textbook for courtroom decorum is ''Perry Mason.'' 
To describe ''Catch Me if You Can'' (which takes its title from the autobiography of the real Frank Abagnale) as a smart, funny caper film is to ignore its strain of sly social satire. If the spine of the story is the elaborate cat-and-mouse game of Frank and Carl, the movie, written by Jeff Nathanson, is also a delicately barbed reflection on the American character and the giddy 60's ethos that allowed Frank to live out his fantasies. The 60's, you may recall, were the decade when jobs became ''gigs.'' And John Williams's uncharacteristically jaunty, saxophone-flavored score captures that spirit of frisky devil-may-care merriment. 
The film's cheeky attitude is distilled in a fable Frank Sr. passes down to his son about two mice who fall into a vat of cream. One mouse instantly drowns, while the other puts up such a furious struggle that the cream turns into butter and the mouse walks out. That story is repeated three times in the movie, the third time as a ludicrous mealtime blessing Frank delivers at the Strongs' dinner table. 
Without referring to the burgeoning hippie culture or to the era's radical politics, drugs and rock 'n' roll, ''Catch Me if You Can'' captures the frivolous side of the 60's: the decade of ''The Pink Panther'' movies, ''The Girl From Ipanema,'' the Rat Pack and James Bond. A clip of Sean Connery and Honor Blackman swapping double-entendres in ''Goldfinger'' introduces a delicious scene, set to the silky purr of Dusty Springfield's ''Look of Love,'' in which Frank, impersonating a junior-size Bond wannabe, outwits a high-priced call girl. 
Among Frank's assumed identities, the one he savors the most is airline pilot. And the movie's zaniest scenes remind us of those tinselly days when air travel was sold as sex in the sky. Before the arrival of the metal detector lent aviation an ominous undertone, every airline passenger was a jet setter, uniformed pilots rivaled astronauts in masculine sex appeal, and a lubricious novelty like ''Coffee, Tea or Me? The Uninhibited Memoirs of Two Airline Stewardesses'' could be a best seller. 
The movie's recurrent images of squealing, strutting flight attendants batting their eyes at the pilots are a hilarious throwback to a swinging 60's just before a resurgent feminism rewrote the rules of courtship and airline employment, and turned stewardesses from jiggly, compliant bunnies into crisply efficient flight attendants. 
Arguably the best-acted of any Spielberg film, ''Catch Me if You Can'' finds Mr. Hanks displaying his usual aplomb. The actor hones a severe, potentially drab role into an incisive, touching character study of a lonely, humorless New England workaholic whose adrenaline is fired by a cat-and-mouse game in which he loses all the early rounds. Over time, Carl develops a respect and a paternal fondness for Frank. And in the movie's finale, the father-son theme culminates in Frank having to choose between the values of his real father and the surrogate dad who reined him in. 
''Catch Me'' is the most charming of Mr. Spielberg's mature films, because is it so relaxed. Instead of trying to conjure fairy-tale magic, wring tears or insinuate a message, it is happy just to be its delicious, genially sophisticated self. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some strong language and mild sexual situations.

‽
‽Gangs of New York‽,‽GANGS OF NEW YORK,'' Martin Scorsese's brutal, flawed and indelible epic of 19th-century urban criminality, begins in a mud-walled, torchlighted cavern, where a group of warriors prepare for battle, arming themselves with clubs and blades and armoring themselves in motley leather and cloth. Though this is Lower Manhattan in 1846, it might as well be the Middle Ages or the time of Gilgamesh: these warlike rituals have an archaic, archetypal feeling. 
And the participants are aware of this. As the members of various colorfully named Irish gangs emerge into the winter daylight of Paradise Square (a place long since given over to high-rises and resurrected here on the grounds of the vast Cinecittà studio complex in Rome), their native-born Protestant enemies greet them with an invocation of ''the ancient laws of combat.'' The ensuing melee turns the new-fallen snow pink with blood and claims the life of Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), an Irish gang chieftain whose young son witnesses the carnage. 
Sixteen years later, the boy, whose name is Amsterdam, has grown into Leonardo DiCaprio, his wide, implacable face framed by lank hair and a wispy Van Dyke. He returns from a long stint in the Hell Gate Reformatory to his old neighborhood, the Five Points, and finds it ruled by his father's killer, Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), known as the Butcher, a swaggering monster who has turned the anniversary of Priest's death into a local holiday. 
Like a figure out of Jacobean theater or a Dumas novel, Amsterdam is consumed by the need for revenge. With the help of a boyhood friend (Henry Thomas), he infiltrates the Butcher's inner circle, becoming a surrogate son to the man who assassinated his father and who now, in accordance with those ancient laws, venerates Priest's memory. 
The New York evoked in Amsterdam's voice-over is ''a city full of tribes and war chiefs,'' whose streets are far meaner than any Mr. Scorsese has contemplated before. The Butcher has formed an alliance of convenience with Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent), the kingpin of Tammany Hall, and together they administer an empire of graft, extortion and larceny that would put any 20th-century movie gangster or political boss to shame. Rival fire companies turn burning buildings into sites of rioting and plunder; crowds gather to witness hangings, bare-knuckled boxing contests and displays of knife throwing. 
As new immigrants, from Ireland and elsewhere, pour off the ships in New York harbor, they are mustered into Tweed's Democratic Party and then, since they lack the $300 necessary to buy their way out, into the Union Army. Occasionally a detachment of reform-minded swells will tour the Points, availing themselves of the perennial privileges of squeamish titillation and easy moral superiority. This anarchic inferno is, in Amsterdam's words, not so much a city as ''a cauldron in which a great city might be forged.'' 
And in recreating it, Mr. Scorsese has made a near-great movie. His interest in violence, both random and organized, is matched by his love of street-level spectacle. His Old New York is a gaudy multiethnic carnival of misrule, music and impromptu theater, a Breughel painting come to life. Though the details of this lawless, teeming, vibrant milieu may be unfamiliar, we nonetheless instinctively recognize it, from the 19th-century novels of Dickens and Zola, from samurai movies and American westerns and from some of this director's previous films. 
Most notably in ''Mean Streets, ''Goodfellas,'' ''The Age of Innocence'' and ''Casino,'' Mr. Scorsese has functioned as a kind of romantic visual anthropologist, fascinated by tribal lore and language, by half-acknowledged codes of honor and retribution and by the boundaries between loyalty and vengeance, between courtesy and violence, that underlie a given social order. 
As in ''Casino'' and ''The Age of Innocence,'' the setting of ''Gangs'' is sometimes more interesting than the story. At 2 hours 45 minutes, the film, deftly edited by Mr. Scorsese's frequent collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, moves swiftly and elegantly. It is never dull, but I must confess that I wish it were longer, so that the lives of the protagonists, rather than standing out in relief against a historical background, were more fully embedded within it. The quasi-Oedipal struggle between Amsterdam and Bill is meant to have a mythic resonance, but that makes it the most conventional element in the picture. 
The relationship between the two men is triangulated by Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a flame-haired thief (and a protégée of Bill's) who catches Amsterdam's eye and steals his lucky religious medallion. But like Sharon Stone in ''Casino,'' Ms. Diaz ends up with no outlet for her spitfire energies, since her character is more a structural necessity -- the linchpin of male jealousy -- than a fully imagined person. The limitations of her role point to a more serious lapse, which is the movie's lack of curiosity about what women's lives might have been like in Old New York. 
Like Tony Soprano's crew in the V.I.P. room at the Bada Bing, Bill and his minions spend a lot of time cavorting with half-naked prostitutes, which is fair (and for all I know accurate) enough. But all the glum evocation of lost fathers makes you wonder if any of these guys had mothers, and you wonder what a typical household in the Five Points might have looked like. (Though I, like just about everyone else, had been waiting impatiently for ''Gangs,'' I almost wish Mr. Scorsese and his screenwriters had been delayed long enough to take account of ''Paradise Alley,'' Kevin Baker's new novel about the draft riots of 1863, in which some of the events touched on in this movie are perceived through women's eyes.) 
These objections should not detract from an appreciation of what Mr. Scorsese and his cast have done. Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz may be too pretty for the neighborhood, but one should hardly hold their being movie stars against them; they are smart, eager and intrepid actors as well. For his part Mr. Day-Lewis positively luxuriates in his character's villainy and turns Bill's flavorsome dialogue into vernacular poetry. 
He understands the Shakespearean dimensions of the character and has enough art to fill them out. Surrounded by Irish brogues and deracinated British accents, Mr. Day-Lewis has the wit to speak an early version of Noo Yawkese, making the Butcher the butt of a marvelous historical joke: this bigoted, all-but-forgotten nativist, it turns out, bequeathed his speech patterns to the children of the immigrants he despised. 
''Gangs of New York'' is an important film as well as an entertaining one. With this project, Mr. Scorsese has made his passionate ethnographic sensibility the vehicle of an especially grand ambition. He wants not only to reconstruct the details of life in a distant era but to construct, from the ground up, a narrative of historical change, to explain how we -- New Yorkers, Americans, modern folk who disdain hand-to-hand bloodletting and overt displays of corruption -- got from there to here, how the ancient laws gave way to modern ones. 
Such an ambition is rare in American movies, and rarer still is the sense of tragedy and contradiction that Mr. Scorsese brings to his saga. There is very little in the history of American cinema to prepare us for the version of American history Mr. Scorsese presents here. It is not the usual triumphalist story of moral progress and enlightenment, but rather a blood-soaked revenger's tale, in which the modern world arrives in the form of a line of soldiers firing into a crowd. 
The director's great accomplishment, the result of three decades of mulling and research inspired by Herbert Asbury's ''Gangs of New York'' -- a 1928 book nearly as legendary as the world it illuminates -- has been to bring to life not only the texture of the past but its force and velocity as well. For all its meticulously imagined costumes and sets (for which the production designer, Dante Ferretti, surely deserves an Oscar), this is no costume drama. 
It is informed not by the polite antiquarianism of Merchant and Ivory but by the political ardor of someone like Luchino Visconti, one of Mr. Scorsese's heroes. ''Senso,'' Visconti's lavish 1953 melodrama set during the Italian Risorgimento (and his first color film), is one of the touchstones of ''My Voyage to Italy,'' Mr. Scorsese's fascinating, quasi-autobiographical documentary on postwar Italian cinema. 
Though ''Gangs of New York'' throws in its lot with the rabble rather than the aristocracy, it shares with ''Senso'' (and also with ''The Leopard,'' Visconti's 1965 masterpiece) a feeling that the past, so full of ambiguity and complexity, of barbarism and nobility, continues to send its aftershocks into the present. It shows us a world on the brink of vanishing and manages to mourn that world without doubting the inevitability or the justice of its fate. 
''America was born in the streets,'' the posters for ''Gangs'' proclaim. Later, Amsterdam Vallon, in the aftermath of the draft riots, muses that ''our great city was born in blood and tribulation.'' Nobody as steeped in film history as Mr. Scorsese could offer such a metaphor without conjuring the memory of D. W. Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation,'' and Griffith, along with John Ford and others, is one of the targets of Mr. Scorsese's revisionism. 
In Griffith's film, adapted from ''The Clansman,'' a best-selling novel by Thomas Dixon, the American republic was reborn after Reconstruction, when the native-born whites of the North and South overcame their sectional differences in the name of racial supremacy. Ford's myth of American origins -- which involved the subjugation of the frontier and the equivocal replacement of antique honor by modern justice -- also typically took place after the Civil War. 
In ''Gangs,'' which opens nationwide today, the pivotal event in our history is the riot that convulsed New York in July of 1863. While this emphasis places the immigrant urban working class at the center of the American story -- a fairly radical notion in itself -- the film hardly sentimentalizes the insurrection, which was both a revolt against local and federal authority and a vicious massacre of the black citizens of New York. 
The rioters are seen as exploited, oppressed and destined to be cannon fodder in a war they barely understand, but they are far from heroic, and the violence of the riots makes the film's opening gang battle seem quaint and decorous. What we are witnessing is the eclipse of warlordism and the catastrophic birth of a modern society. Like the old order, the new one is riven by class resentment, racism and political hypocrisy, attributes that change their form at every stage of history but that seem to be as embedded in human nature as the capacity for decency, solidarity and courage. 
This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology, either liberal or conservative. Mr. Scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated. 
This movie was a long time in the making, but its life has barely begun. Now that the industry gossip about it has subsided, let us hope that a more substantial discussion can start. People who care about American history, professionally and otherwise, will no doubt weigh in on the accuracy of its particulars and the validity of its interpretation; they will also, I hope, revisit some of their own suppositions in light of its unsparing and uncompromised imagining of the past. I said earlier that ''Gangs of New York'' is nearly a great movie. I suspect that, over time, it will make up the distance. 
''Gangs of New York'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The pervasiveness of its violence makes you realize how much New York has changed in a century and a half. On the other hand, the nudity, profanity and sexual references may lead you to think that it has barely changed at all.

‽
‽Two Weeks Notice‽,‽Breezing along on gusts of stale air and perky inanities, ''Two Weeks Notice'' is a romantic comedy so vague and sadly undernourished that it makes one of Nora Ephron's low-cal strawberry sodas seem as tempting as a Philip Barry feast. As George Wade (Hugh Grant), a rich, piggy New York real estate developer, and Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock), the Brooklyn-based environmental lawyer he hires as his chief counsel, spar and parry, you are supposed to think Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. 
How long will it be before the yammering, brainy lawyer shuts up and succumbs to her boss's rakish charms? And once he realizes her true worth (she boasts that she makes love like ''a bobcat pretzel,'' whatever that is), how long before her kisses instill him with a teeny-weeny blip of social conscience? After you've endured a half-hour of the movie's toothless sitcom dialogue, the answer is the sooner the better. 
''Two Weeks Notice'' -- the first feature directed by Marc Lawrence, a writer of the beauty pageant spoof ''Miss Congeniality,'' a far wittier film that also starred Ms. Bullock -- is so desperate for laughs that it ends up looking for them in the bathroom. Even then it comes up short. Its most ambitious joke is to give Lucy a sudden attack of diarrhea in the middle of a traffic jam while she and George are driving back to Manhattan from a Mets game at which she consumed too much junk food. 
Her chivalrous boss insists they abandon the car then and there, and he bribes the driver of the nearest trailer to let Lucy use the toilet. While she groans and retches in the background, George gallantly makes small talk with the Kentucky rednecks who have taken them in. 
But what's one abandoned car, anyway, to a man as rich as George? When they reach a shopping center, he has his company helicopter fly in to whisk the couple back to Manhattan. In a movie that worships wealth while pretending to have a social conscience, that scenic ride is the swooning equivalent of a trip to the Moon. 
''Two Weeks Notice,'' which opens today nationwide, seems to be more about star casting than about love, politics, business or anything else. And at least on paper the pairing of Mr. Grant and Ms. Bullock (who produced the movie) makes sense. He specializes in stammering Prince Charmings who, with a flick of their scepters, confer a swanlike grace on the avaricious, not-so-ugly ducklings swarming around them, tin cups in hand. She specializes in feisty independent tomboys in flight from their inner princesses, whose pesky, demanding hormones lead them back to true love despite their principles. Had these two clicked on the screen, they might have emerged as Hollywood's new odd couple: Prince Charming and his radiant made-over Minnie Mouse. 
But ambling through their screwball paces, the stars exhibit so little personal chemistry that they seem barely aware of each other. When, late in the movie, Lucy gets dolled up for a fancy bash, and George really notices her for the first time, his look of love is so unconvincing it confers no sparkle. As the camera admires Ms. Bullock through his eyes, Minnie Mouse looks more like Michael Jackson in drag than Cinderella. 
''Two Weeks Notice'' might not seem quite so fatuous had it not appeared years after ''Sex and the City'' raised the bar on urban romantic comedy and sharpened pop cultural discussions of sex, money and social mobility. Although the genre still allows mice to turn into princesses and frogs into princes, nowadays those transformations require some credible explanation. 
But Mr. Grant's George, an American with a British accent and apparently a testosterone deficiency, exudes barely a trace of the wheeler-dealer chutzpah his real estate career would demand. The movie's suggestion that this hard-boiled softy is a suave lothario who would hire bimbo lawyers with dubious academic credentials just to sleep with them is ludicrous. 
Ms. Bullock's Lucy is only marginally more believable. Despite her Harvard Law School background, this character, who must be pushing 40, still lives near her parents in Coney Island. When she's home alone at night, she orders three times as much Chinese takeout as she can consume. Isn't that cute? 
For these predestined sweethearts to connect, of course, George must eventually change his ways. All it takes to turn this moral monster into Mother Teresa is for him to agree not to raze a community center in Lucy's neighborhood. That decision entails a painful sacrifice. From now on George will have to share the company helicopter. Talk about cut-rate redemption, Hollywood style. 
''Two Weeks Notice'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some strong language and mild sexual situations.

‽The Wild Thornberrys Movie‽,‽A blend of ''Dr. Dolittle'' and ''Family Ties,'' the animated series ''The Wild Thornberrys'' has been a staple of the Nickleodeon children's cable network since 1998. Never shy about exploiting its brand names, Nickelodeon has now turned the program into a feature film, carrying over most of the creative personnel of the series. 
On screen, ''The Wild Thornberrys'' looks just as it does on television, only wider. The directors, Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian, use a Cinemascope-like frame to create a cartoon Africa with a greater sweep than its television counterpart, though the visuals inevitably fall short of their obvious model, Disney's ''Lion King.'' Without the financial or creative resources of the Disney animators, ''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' remains essentially an extended Saturday morning cartoon -- which is to say, a series of hastily executed illustrations matched to a voice track. 
The Thornberrys are an Anglo-American family of five. Dad Nigel is a blustery upper-class Englishman (entertainingly voiced by Tim Curry with the rolling vowels of C. Aubrey Smith) who with his plucky American wife, Marianne (Jodi Carlisle), makes nature documentaries for public television. They have two daughters, 12-year-old Eliza (Lacey Chabert), a shy girl with glasses, braces and spots on her face that could be either freckles or acne, and Debbie (Danielle Harris), a hormonally charged teenager who pines for American shopping malls. Their little brother, Donnie (played in grunts and squeals by the rock star Flea), is a still-unsocialized wild child, discovered and adopted by the Thornberrys during one of their expeditions. 
The series hangs on Eliza's magical ability to talk to the animals, granted to her by an African shaman on the condition that her special skills must always remain a secret. This allows her to communicate with her favorite pet, a chimpanzee named Darwin (Tom Kane), whose posh British accent and relentless snobbishness suggest that he, too, has spent some time on the playing fields of Eton. 
Eliza and Darwin set out to rescue a cheetah cub who has been snatched from the veldt by a pair of high-tech poachers (Rupert Everett and Marisa Tomei). They do, though it takes them a little longer than it would on television, involving as it does the need to escape from an oppressive British boarding school (where the headmistress has the voice of Brenda Blethyn) and beat it back to the cartoon Congo. 
The film, which opens nationally today, is bland but harmless. 
''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the action scenes may be too suspenseful for tiny viewers.

‽The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers‽,‽The director Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion for the second of the film adaptations, ''The Two Towers.'' It may be the first sequel that does not bother to reprise the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is to simply drop us right into the action. 
Even for those deeply immersed in the material, this stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension -- the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey; this mission began in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, begins the end of life in Middle Earth, as was indicated in the first ''Ring'' movie, ''The Fellowship of the Ring.'' 
Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source. Mr. Jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence, creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material. Mr. Jackson's ploy in this beautifully considered epic is to give viewers the same feeling of confusion that his characters are experiencing. By doing this he simultaneously answers those who complained that too much of the previous ''Rings'' was about setup. 
A brief recap of a climactic battle between the friendly wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a fire demon -- one of many climactic battles from ''Fellowship'' -- is shown near the start. But this scene is used to set ''The Two Towers'' in motion. It is a daring gambit to have viewers enter a movie bearing such complex preceding action with so little information. Even though the first film took in enough cash to jump-start the flagging United States economy single-handedly, Mr. Jackson does not seem to understand that there are people who haven't absorbed the ''Rings'' chronology into the entirety of their beings. And there may even be folks out there who haven't seen ''Fellowship,'' but will be lured into theaters for ''Towers'' by all the attention that ''Fellowship'' attracted. Such moviegoers may feel left out, puzzled and unable to keep up. 
With the narrative of ''Rings,'' Tolkien was investigating determination, loyalty and, finally, faith, finding innumerable ways to offer up the concept of purity of heart, as found in Matthew 5:8 and in Kierkegaard, whose contention was that purity of heart was the ability to will one thing into being. The pursuit of purity is at the center of ''Towers.'' 
For our hero, Frodo, whose quest is to purge the forces of menacing evil from Middle Earth, purity is demonstrated by combating the temptation to wear the ring and be consumed by its corrupting power. He gets a taste of what the future might be like when he and Sam meet Gollum, a hobbit who was once seduced by the ring. He is now an emotional and physical shambles; emaciated and slunk into a perpetual crouch, Gollum's translucent, waxy skin is a membrane that just barely contains his insides. 
Gollum is divided within himself; he is an infantilized wreck who wants to please and befriend the hobbits. But he is also a hissing, bitter child-man whose paranoia keeps him breathing, and plotting. Gollum is a computer-generated creation and as fully realized a character as can be found in ''Towers'' -- perhaps the most fully realized. (He has been dropped into the movie more effectively than George Lucas crammed Jar Jar Binks into his recent ''Star Wars'' addenda.) With the voice of Andy Serkis, whose movements were also copied by the animators, Gollum is torn by his nature, and Mr. Jackson allows him to be conflicted in a way none of the other characters in the film are. 
This is partially because ''Towers'' is more or less a bridge to the finale of the ''Rings'' trilogy due a year from now, though this picture is one of the most accomplished holding actions ever. 
So, much of the flow of ''Towers'' is dictated by the amount of information that has to be saved for the next installment. Mr. Jackson compensates for that by inflating the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle against the endless, possessed armies of the villainous magician Saruman (Christopher Lee), the foe responsible for the fate of Gandalf. In his flowing white gowns and beard, Mr. Lee's warlock is a force to be reckoned with because he alone has a voice as commanding as Mr. McKellen's. 
In sheer action mechanics, Mr. Jackson's achievements in ''Towers'' are even more compelling than what he managed the first time around; he has given the martial scenes of this sequel a completely different thrust. His engrossing action style is exciting and dramatic; when the swells of Saruman's army crash into the walls of the king's castle, we could be watching Orson Welles's ''Chimes at Midnight'' as directed by George A. Romero -- Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. The exultant creepiness of horror films is Mr. Jackson's instinctive filmmaking style. He exaggerates it here in epic terms, and the grandeur is astonishing -- one scene of Saruman's creatures flinging themselves at the castle is framed as an overhead shot, with their shields moving like the wings of a peculiarly lyric and fatal insect. 
Mr. Jackson's mastery of craft in some areas is so powerful that the flaws are more noticeable than in the first film. The little-boy allure of the storytelling in ''Towers'' is sure to evoke the same reaction that it did in ''Fellowship.'' ''Towers'' is like a family-oriented E-rated video game, with no emotional complications other than saving the day. Women have so little to do here that they serve almost as plot-device flight attendants, offering a trough of Diet Coke to refresh the geek-magnet story. (It is a lapse in Tolkien's work that Mr. Jackson has not figured out a way to correct, even with the token reappearances of Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett from the first film.) 
Mr. McKellen is a marginal presence this time around, which is unfortunate because he is needed for ballast; ''Rings'' is such a kids' fantasy that a daddy figure is required. He is the father who soothes his charges under the spell of Tolkien's bad-dream threats. But he does get one -- only one -- whooping chance to do so in ''Towers.'' 
The most incredible accomplishment of ''Towers'' is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewer's attention. Because ''The Two Towers,'' which opens worldwide today, has to keep so much story in reserve for the last installment, the movie falls short on emotional involvement. Still, Mr. Jackson rises so completely to the challenges here that I can't wait to see his next movie -- by that, I mean the one after the ''Ring'' cycle ends. 
''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for pounding, long scenes of sword and flaming-catapult action and unsettling mystic evil.

‽Drumline‽,‽''Drumline,'' directed by Charles Stone III (''Paid in Full'') from a screenplay by Tina Gordon Chism and Shawn Shepps, celebrates a vibrant American cultural tradition. At historically black colleges like the fictitious Atlanta A&amp;T University and its real-life crosstown rival, Morris Brown College, a Saturday afternoon football game is something of an afterthought, an excuse to watch the marching bands engage in fiercely competitive battles of rhythm, choreography and showmanship. 
For more than 50 years, with ever greater flash and inventiveness, these ''show style'' bands have thrilled their fans with performances that combine military precision with breathtaking musical flair. 
''Drumline,'' which opens today nationwide, offers a generous showcase for this irresistible art form. The movie is structured like a musical, pinning a skimpy, hectic plot to rousing sequences of rhythmic invention, including both large-scale stadium-shaking production numbers and sharp, intense episodes of hand-to-hand musical combat. 
The story is nearly as crowded as a gridiron at halftime. Hundreds of musicians stomp and gyrate, but not enough of the collegiate musicians' discipline has rubbed off on the filmmakers. It hardly matters, since they have found an engaging lead actor in Nick Cannon, star of a self-titled series on Nickelodeon, and a subject that has waited too long for big-screen recognition. Spike Lee's ''School Daze'' and the long-running ''Cosby Show'' spinoff ''A Different World'' notwithstanding, African-American college life remains relatively unexplored territory in popular culture, a deficit ''Drumline'' should help to remedy. 
Mr. Cannon plays Devon Miles, a talented young drummer from Harlem who attends A&amp;T on a full scholarship. His high regard for his own skills and his streetwise individualism quickly come into conflict with the ritual and regimentation of the university's program. The lead drummer, Sean, who is threatened by Devon's gifts, soon becomes his nemesis. Their rivalry, and its inevitable resolution, provides the picture's most interesting and most sustained drama, though there is plenty more going on. 
The band's buttoned-up, old-school director, Dr. Lee (an unusually restrained Orlando Jones), is under pressure from the administration to produce more crowd-pleasing spectacles and to win back the national championship from his showboating mentor over at Morris Brown. Devon's romantic interest in a cheerleader (Zoë Saldana) provides a few tender moments; references to his troubled family background lend a touch of pathos; and a cast of stock secondary characters is on hand for occasional comic relief. These include a nerdy guy, a bulky tuba player, the drumline's token woman and an example of the latest movie stereotype, the white guy besotted with African-American music, culture and speech. (See also ''Barbershop.'' Ya feelin' me, dog?) 
If all this does not quite add up to a coherent movie, it does produce a bouncy, boisterous and charming one, which becomes downright thrilling when it shows the bands in action. Their musical style is an ebullient stew of influences that include hip-hop, jazz improvisation and New Orleans second-line marching music as well as classic funk and, thanks to Dr. Lee, ''The Flight of the Bumblebee.'' 
The climactic showdown -- staged during the BET marching band classic, without the distraction of football -- tops the rap battle at the end of ''8 Mile'' for suspense and inventiveness. As you watch the drummers pound out their polyrhythms and twirl their sticks, you may find it hard to stay in your seat. Mr. Stone wisely ends the movie there, on the field, freezing the frame while the splendid percussion rings in your ears. 
''Drumline'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity and a few sexual references.

‽The Hot Chick‽,‽In ''The Hot Chick,'' his bluntly titled new farce, the comic actor Rob Schneider runs an obstacle course of taste and emerges remarkably unsullied, considering the choices he faces. In portraying a spoiled teenage girl who wakes up in the body of a 30-year-old man, Mr. Schneider could have taken any number of potentially offensive tacks. Instead, he brings an almost doelike sweetness to the role of Jessica, a snooty high school cheerleader whose world suddenly shatters when she loses half a pair of stolen earrings that carry an ancient African curse. When a scruffy petty criminal discovers the lost earring at a gas station and tries it on, the two exchange bodies. 
''The Hot Chick,'' which opens today nationwide, is a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' which became a movie with Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan. In that slippery theatrical fairy tale, a young bride on her wedding day exchanges souls with a strange, ailing old man who appears at the wedding. Years later, the groom meets the old man and recognizes the soul of his long-lost beloved inside the geezer's crumbling flesh. 
Mr. Schneider's movie, which he wrote with his regular collaborator, Tom Brady, who directed, expresses the same faith in true love as ''Prelude to a Kiss'' but translates that message into the leering vocabulary of a teenage comedy. Although it takes a lot of convincing, Jessica's adoring boyfriend, Billy (Matthew Lawrence), eventually recognizes his sweetheart inside her new body. Even then, however, he can't bring himself to give her a kiss. 
If the movie is about an exchange of souls, most of its jokes revolve around the physical differences between boys and girls. The newly masculinized Jessica is horrified to discover hair growing in her nose and ears. And once she convinces her best high school friends that she is who she says she is (a remarkably easy task, considering what she looks like), they insist she show them her male private parts. Late in the movie, there is a delicately handled flirtation with lesbianism in which Jessica's closest friend, April (Anna Faris), confesses her attraction. 
But the movie, true to its genre, is not always so delicate. It is packed with dumb, farcical roughhouse in which Mr. Schneider, his eyes popping in querulous disbelief, is battered and tossed like a big, hairy rag doll. In the funniest scene, set in the men's room of a dance club, Jessica displays a total ignorance of male urination and has to be instructed by a kindly, dumbfounded attendant (Dick Gregory). 
The biggest problem facing Mr. Schneider's portrayal of a man with a dainty heart and soul was the necessity to avoid making the character an effeminate gay stereotype. And while the movie has its share of gay innuendo, it's careful to mute any homophobia. 
Jessica eventually emerges from her travails a better, more compassionate person. In her campaign to undo the curse, she has to enlist the uncool high school peers she used to scorn. In the guise of her family's Chicano gardener, she develops a buddy-buddy relationship with her father that helps her heal her parents' troubled marriage (but not before her sexually frustrated mother makes a lunging pass). 
And what of the man who finds himself in Jessica's sleek, well-tended body? The movie doesn't pay him much heed until the end, when it drags most of the major characters to the Pole Cat, a sleazy bar, where he is making a good living as a feisty exotic dancer. Rachel McAdams, who plays the pre-transformation Jessica, has to make a huge stretch from a snooty Britney Spears clone to a tigress. She is far more convincing as the former. 
''The Hot Chick'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It is loaded with off-color humor and sexual innuendo.

‽
‽Evelyn‽,‽When you hear that the new melodrama ''Evelyn'' is based on a true story about a ragged, determined dad who, abandoned by his wife, fought a brutal law to regain custody of his children -- including a little daughter with an unyielding belief in human charity and decency -- it sounds like a shovelful of sentimentality that even James Bond couldn't successfully battle. Yet in the person of Pierce Brosnan, he does. Though the film is spongy and drenched in sweetness, Bruce Beresford's direction is steady and well oiled. ''Evelyn'' has a breeziness of spirit; nothing lingers too long, for Mr. Beresford keeps the modest movie moving. 
The picture, which opens today in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, could actually be called ''Desmond.'' It's just as much about Desmond Doyle's fight against the Family Act of 1941, an Irish law that essentially deprived single fathers of the right to care for their children, as it is about Evelyn. (The movie ever so subtly offers the opinion that the Roman Catholic Church may have been behind this law, exploiting child labor in the bargain.) 
Mr. Brosnan's Desmond is a Dublin house painter in the 1950's whose wife leaves him the day after Christmas because she's bored. A brief glimpse of their marriage indicates it's nothing more than two sluggers in a grudge match. In one of the film's characteristic odd touches, the 9-year-old Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur) thinks her mom is running off to shop and tries to stop her because the stores are closed. 
Desmond's mother-in-law reports the situation to the authorities, and when Evelyn and her brothers are packed off to a convent and a monastery, the tortures of the damned surely await them. Evelyn, with a plentiful dusting of freckles on her nose and a firm, clean spirit, is the kind of target made for punishment by movie nuns, and she takes her share of licks; there's still little that's quite so shocking as seeing a child beaten in a movie. 
Mr. Beresford doesn't give the corporal punishment scenes here the voyeuristic treatment that makes such material seem staged for the delectation of an audience segment in serious need of therapy. The title sets up an expectation that the movie is going to show more of these horrors that Evelyn endures than it actually does. Fortunately, it's a promise Mr. Beresford doesn't feel he has to fulfill. The film works as a contrast to the dry self-consciousness of his ''Tender Mercies'' and the high-handed condescension of his ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' a movie that assumed black people liked being subservient. 
Desmond, whose real gift is soaking himself with ale at pubs, has to straighten up for the battle against church and state. Stephen Rea, a dandy of a lawyer helping with the case, makes these intimidating forces sound like an intersection. He is eventually joined by Aidan Quinn and Alan Bates, who is making a welcome return to the movies. Unfortunately, Mr. Bates's role as a former national football star who has become an esteemed though slightly daunted attorney is too raffishly charming. He's been given all the twinkle that even little Evelyn eschews. 
''Evelyn'' is slight and dogged; its surprises are likable but minor. Mr. Brosnan plays Desmond as a man who seems to be shaking off a fog; the deliberate repetitions of lines, a device he uses in his Bond movies to weigh the import of a sentence, is employed here to show a man trying to figure out what's going on. (Sometimes he seems even less bright than Sean Penn's mentally handicapped father in ''I Am Sam.'') Mr. Brosnan's deftness gives the film an enjoyable wrinkle, since he gets more out of vanity than any other actor. 
Given that any real sociopolitical impact has been removed from the Bond films, Mr. Brosnan makes the adventures important in a different way. His Bond takes every mission as a blow to his pride, and his Desmond does the same thing. It's a novel use of self-absorption, but in ''Evelyn'' he is finally roused from it by love of family. 
''Evelyn'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has cruelty to children, strong language and hearty ale consumption.

‽
‽Star Trek: Nemesis‽,‽Let's have a small round of applause for good old reliable ''Star Trek.'' Now deep into its fourth decade (if you count its television and screen incarnations) the science-fiction franchise, like the indestructible James Bond series, keeps chugging along inside its own cheerfully nostalgic time warp. 
New generations of adventurers may have seized the helm of the Starship Enterprise, but the replacement crews exhibit the same gung-ho spirit and twinkling faith in humanity as the original one. As long as these liberal humanist missionaries, working in clockwork harmony with their rainbow coalition of extraterrestrial and android colleagues, keep on going where no man has gone before, cornball 60's optimism will have a future. 
''Nemesis,'' the 10th ''Star Trek'' movie to appear since 1979 (and the fourth to feature the ''Next Generation'' crew), is an amiably klutzy affair whose warm, fuzzy heart emits intermittent bleats from the sleeve of its gleaming spacesuit. Although the action takes place outside our solar system, the movie is unapologetically and comfortingly Earth-centric. In the universe of ''Star Trek,'' Earth will always be the planet from which all progress emanates, especially healthy moral development. 
In keeping with the franchise's tradition of reflecting the science headlines of the moment, ''Nemesis,'' which opens today nationwide, addresses cloning and human personality with a psychotherapeutic earnestness. The core of the drama finds Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) confronting his evil clone, Shinzon (Tom Hardy), and realizing it isn't genes that determine personality but environment. 
That clone, a power-mad military dictator out to destroy first the Enterprise and then the Earth with a blast of radiation, may be a biological replica of the virtuous captain, but he doesn't have a nice bone in his body. To use the slangy argot of ''West Side Story,'' he's depraved on account of he's deprived. What sent the poor clone on the path to moral ruin was a miserable youth spent in exile, toiling in the extraterrestrial equivalent of a Siberian salt mine. 
For a certified biological replica, Shinzon doesn't look or sound much like his primary source except that both have shaved heads and cleft chins. In fact, Mr. Hardy, with his pudgy, full-lipped baby face and large glowering eyes, is in many ways the physical opposite of Mr. Stewart, who is all bony angles and cool slit-eyed vigilance. Shinzon is a really a futurist Caligula who speaks in the high, sour whine of a spoiled boy emperor throwing a hissy fit. That's quite a contrast to Mr. Stewart's captain with his ringing Shakespearean bass-baritone and imperturbable calm. 
The confrontation between the captain and his clone involves a fairly intricate elaborate setup. The story begins with the wedding of Officer William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes, who directed two earlier ''Star Trek'' movies but not this one) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). As the Enterprise travels from a wedding reception in Riker's native Alaska toward Troi's home world of Betazed, where a second ceremony is to be performed, the ship is sidetracked by an electromagnetic disturbance from the planet Kolarus III. Exploring its terrain, the crew discovers parts of an android that includes a severed talking head. That head turns out to be a crude prototype of the Enterprise's resident android, Commander Data (Brent Spiner), who takes it back to the ship for testing. 
The Enterprise is sidetracked again when the bellicose Romulans, longtime enemies of the Federation, announce to Picard that their new leader wants to negotiate a peace treaty with the Federation. Picard is understandably suspicious, but he agrees to meet with the new Praetor, as he is called. To his surprise, that leader, Shinzon, turns out not to be a Romulan but a native of Romulus's sister planet, Remus. 
Picard's clone was developed by the Romulans to deploy as a weapon against the Federation but was never used and was eventually exiled into the hellish dilithium mines of Remus. Shinzon has risen to power under the tutelage of a sinister Reman Viceroy (Ron Perlman) and returned to Romulus to rule as a military dictator over his creators, who are none too happy with his agenda. 
If the screenplay by John Logan (a writer for ''Gladiator'') -- from a story by Mr. Logan, Mr. Spiner and the series's longtime producer and writer Rick Berman -- is riddled with holes to spare, it is true to the spirit of the ''Star Trek'' ethos. And in paralleling the similarities between Data and the severed head of his prototype (which Shinzon used as bait to bring the Enterprise into his sphere) with those between Picard and his clone, it buttresses the movie's philosophy that a sustained personal commitment to self-improvement can humanize androids and even turn bad seeds into good ones. 
In the movie's climactic speech, Picard lectures his embittered clone on the benefits of being a better person. The movie's sentimental faith in the power of positive thinking is further reiterated in its images of an android croaking out the lyrics to Irving Berlin's ''Blue Skies.'' 
''Star Trek: Nemesis,'' directed by Stuart Baird (''Executive Decision,'' ''U.S. Marshals''), is so determined to deliver colorful action that it stretches out its final battle sequence much longer than necessary and reaches two or three possible conclusions before finally ringing down the curtain. The most exciting moment arrives when one spaceship deliberately rams into another. The accumulating destruction, grand and protracted, suggests the collision of two great ocean liners. 
''Star Trek: Nemesis'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mild violence and horror effects.

The video may show her canoodling on the deck of a sailboat with the handsome Ben Affleck, her latest beau, and lounging half-dressed on an expensive-looking sofa in a lovely high-rise apartment, but the lyrics insist that at heart she is still a striving, streetwise Puerto Rican girl from New York City. 
Ms. Lopez's new movie, the blandly charming romantic comedy ''Maid in Manhattan,'' makes a similar point. Her character, Marisa Ventura, is a single mother who lives in the Bronx and makes her living cleaning rooms in a super-luxurious Manhattan hotel. Even when her fortunes take a fairy-tale turn and she briefly trades in her maid's uniform for a creamy Dolce &amp; Gabbana coat (and, later, a ravishing evening dress accessorized with a Harry Winston necklace), Marisa does not lose her tough, determined attitude. The film's message, like the song's, is that upward mobility is not a betrayal of working-class values but rather their ultimate fulfillment. 
This is an appealing idea -- one that has sustained film comedies at least since the Depression. And Ms. Lopez, even in underwritten, not-funny-enough pictures like this one (or the earlier, somewhat similar ''Wedding Planner'') has some of the forthright magnetism of an old-time movie star. In the steamy ''Jenny From the Block'' video, she shows off her body, giving the cable subscribers of America generous glimpses of what may be, in celebrity if not in size, the biggest backside in the world. (At one point Mr. Affleck, to the envy of millions, uses it as a pillow.) 
In contrast, ''Maid in Manhattan,'' which opens today nationwide, is chastely directed by Wayne Wang from a script by Kevin Wade that contains just a few (perhaps contractually obligatory) references to that famous aspect of Ms. Lopez's anatomy, and it demonstrates that the most potent source of her sexiness is her eyes. You would have to go back to Claudette Colbert or the young Lauren Bacall to find an actress capable of projecting so much erotic self-confidence in a single gaze. And even when Marisa suffers inevitable humiliations and reversals of fortune, Ms. Lopez retains a suave, straight-backed dignity that makes her a credible feminist heroine as well as a bona fide sex symbol. 
Unfortunately, her charisma is hampered by the blandness and banality of the movie itself, which squanders nearly every comic opportunity its urban Cinderella premise provides. Mr. Wang, whose earlier films include ''The Joy Luck Club,'' ''Smoke'' and the wonderful ''Chan Is Missing,'' has a palpable if sentimental affection for multiethnic urban life and an understated feel for both the indignities and the occasional pleasures of hard work in the service sector. 
He respects the professionalism of the hotel workers and the friendly, relaxed solidarity that makes their jobs more bearable. The staff includes Bob Hoskins as a butler whose whispery punctiliousness recalls Anthony Hopkins in ''Remains of the Day,'' Marissa Matrone as Marisa's wisecracking best pal and Chris Eigeman as the predictably uptight manager. All of them show suitable professionalism, but Mr. Wang and Mr. Wade have made them all a little too nice to be funny. 
In general the picture is so committed to inoffensiveness and to hammering home its uplifting, bootstrap message that it lacks the necessary element of malice. The only safe satirical scapegoats are rich, single middle-aged women, like Caroline Lane, a brittle and snobbish Sotheby's executive played by Natasha Richardson, and her leathery, bigoted exercise partner (the hilarious and underused Amy Sedaris). They have some humorous moments, but scenes that should have a breakneck, spring-loaded rhythm unwind lazily without silliness or precision. 
The plot, which might have been a fizzy exercise in latter-day screwball comedy, is set in motion when Marisa tries on some of Caroline's clothes and with the help of her 10-year-old son (Tyler Garcia Posey) catches the eye of Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a wealthy state assemblyman contemplating a run for the United States Senate seat once held by his father. 
Marshall, whom the tabloids have dubbed ''the playboy politico'' and who is devoted to his large dog, is held on a tight leash by his adviser (Stanley Tucci), but he and Marisa nonetheless find time for a stroll in Central Park, where romantic sparks are kindled. Or at least they would be if Mr. Fiennes were not such a damp, milky presence. He tries for a fumbling, rich-guy charm but instead projects a diffidence unsuited either to an ambitious politician or a romantic lead. It's impossible to imagine this guy in bed with an Albany lobbyist, much less with Ms. Lopez. 
Marshall does have one remarkable trait: he is a Republican. An environmentalist, silk-stocking John Lindsay type, to be sure, but still, after Spencer Tracy in ''State of the Union,'' you could probably count the sympathetic big-screen members of the G.O.P. on the fingers of one hand. In any case, Marshall's party affiliation, which is no big deal for Marisa, can count as a touch of realism, given the current shape of New York politics. 
And to its credit ''Maid in Manhattan,'' more than most films of its kind, does try to find a balance between realism and whimsy, to suggest connections between the fantasy it projects and the world as it is. I only wish it were funnier, more persuasive and less pep-talky and that it came closer in spirit and execution to the studio comedies of the 1930's -- movies like ''Easy Living'' or ''Midnight'' -- which are its obvious models. 
Perhaps, though, such gauzy, biting social comedies are no longer possible, which leads to a troubling thought. For movies like ''Maid in Manhattan'' to get much better, the economy may have to get much worse. 
''Maid in Manhattan'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mild profanity and some discreet sexual scenes and references.

‽
‽Analyze That‽,‽For those who find more reality than they can easily stomach in the season's harrowing final episodes of ''The Sopranos,'' ''Analyze That'' offers instant antacid relief. As the lightheaded sequel to the 1999 hit comedy ''Analyze This'' evaporates across the screen, its low-cal effervescence emanates from the comfortably goofy chemistry of its stars, Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Reprising their roles of a mob boss, Paul Vitti, and his beleaguered psychotherapist, Ben Sobel, Mr. De Niro and Mr. Crystal exude a breezy camaraderie that recalls Bing Crosby and Bob Hope ambling jauntily down some nonsensical road to nowhere. 
From the moment Paul, imprisoned in Sing Sing, fakes a psychotic break and begins maniacally singing ''I Feel Pretty'' inside his cell and then lapses into feigned catatonia, ''Analyze That'' turns into a kind of mob vaudeville show in which there is not much difference between a whacking and a ''West Side Story'' ditty delivered in mob dialect. The ludicrous finale is a rendition of ''Somewhere'' bellowed on a waterfront promenade facing Lower Manhattan. 
The movie, directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay he wrote with Peter Steinfeld and Peter Tolan, is contented to be a loose-jointed series of skits, laced with running jokes that poke mild fun at mob movie clichés and therapeutic psychobabble. The most prominent of those leitmotifs, the cliché that grief is ''a process,'' is repeated enough times to become an annoying tic. 
For Mr. De Niro, the role of Paul is a piece of cake because it doesn't appear to involve any work. One reason the star has enjoyed such success in comedy is that audiences feel an instinctive relief from the intensity of his screen persona when he lightens up. In ''Analyze That'' he somersaults off his Great Actor pedestal to become just another Hollywood star hamming it up with his buddies in front the camera. Spoofing his own screen image, he is like a little boy scrunching his face into silly expressions while peering into a mirror, the menace in his slivery eyes brightened by a twinkle signaling that it's all in fun. ''See, it's easy?'' he seems to be saying with a big wink. ''Dark or light, it's only playacting.'' 
Mr. Crystal's Ben conveys a similar on-again-off-again sense of a star alternately toying with a role and just being himself on a well-paid professional vacation. It's always reassuring for audiences to glimpse the vulnerable neurotic behind a therapist's omniscient mask. And in a story that plays with role reversals, Ben, smarting from the death of a father whom he remembers as cold and withholding, experiences paroxysms of neurotic self-doubt. 
But those twitches are never more than airy comic shtick. Behind Mr. Crystal's clowning, there is always the sense of a shrewd, quick-witted comic who keeps a cache of chicken soup simmering behind the curtain. Should an emergency arise, he would be the first to start dishing it out. Eventually, Ben finds himself accompanying a crew of mobsters during a heist in Lower Manhattan. At a critical moment he is forced to save the day by becoming a man of action. 
The story to which these characters have been attached is a bogus contraption wrested from the same twilight zone of television sitcom where hillbillies find themselves in Beverly Hills and buxom, chirping genies materialize to satisfy the whims of their bumbling masters. Under the stern eye of a United States attorney, Paul is discharged from Sing Sing and put in Ben's custody. Ensconced in the doctor's home, he lunges around like the proverbial bull in a china shop, keeping the Sobels awake at night as he cavorts noisily with a prostitute and disrupts a solemn family gathering by appearing in his pajamas to chase the same woman out of the house amid a flurry of curses. 
Although Paul declares he wants to leave the world of crime for legitimate employment, he doesn't try very hard and soon finds himself and his old crew forced to choose sides between rival mob clans, one of them led by Patty LoPresti (Cathy Moriarty-Gentile). In her brief screen appearances, Ms. Moriarty-Gentile, blonder than ever, is as salty a presence as she was two decades ago in ''Raging Bull.'' 
The movie's cleverest notion is to have Paul hired as a consultant for a television series based on ''Little Caesar.'' At his suggestion his mobster friends are brought on to the set to heighten the realism. Although there is the germ of a very sharp comedy in the intersection of real mobsters and make-believe thugs in a Hollywood mob comedy, ''Analyze That'' is far too lazy to do much with it. 
A scene in which the series' Australian star (Anthony LaPaglia) consults Paul for acting tips falls flat. In a cheap shot, the movie makes that series' director an effeminate, hoity-toity refugee from the theater. Poor Lisa Kudrow is wasted in the one-note role of Ben's gently nagging wife, Laura. The choicest smaller performance is Joe Viterelli's sweetly avuncular portrayal of Paul's slit-eyed rhino-size right-hand man, Jelly. 
Given the success of both phenomena, it was probably inevitable that ''Analyze That,'' which opens nationwide today, plays off ''The Sopranos'' in its show-within-a-show concept. Although they may be cousins, the artistic gap between them is as large as the chasm separating a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch from ''Crime and Punishment.'' 
''Analyze That'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and moderate violence.

‽
‽Equilibrium‽,‽In ''Equilibrium,'' which takes place in the not too distant future, emotion has been outlawed. But some things are still the same; the Cadillac STS is still available (though masking tape is applied to hide its markings). And it is driven by a new breed of law-enforcement officer called -- and please don't laugh until I finish this -- Grammaton Cleric, assigned to squash the sense crimes of what could be called the emotion underground. 
The Clerics -- who are all men, so women are even more repressed -- practice a particularly nasty martial and handgun art called Gunkata. In the near future, I guess, bullets are neither deadly nor photogenic enough to accomplish the job. 
One of these men, John Preston (Christian Bale), is at the center of ''Equilibrium,'' a ridiculous sci-fi action melodrama and breath mint. If someone left ''1984,'' ''Fahrenheit 451,'' ''Brave New World,'' ''Gattaca'' and the Sylvester Stallone potboilers ''Judge Dredd'' and ''Demolition Man'' out in the sun and threw the runny glop onto a movie screen, it would still be a better picture than ''Equilibrium,'' a movie that could be stupider only if it were longer. 
Emotion, it seems, caused a third world war. To prevent a fourth, feelings have been made illegal, done away with by a drug called Prozium, which citizens administer to themselves daily. Based on the slender, concave shape of faces of the future, Prozium is as effective a weight-loss tool as those sandwiches at Subway. 
The slender, sleek Preston has repressed everything about himself, including Mr. Bale's English accent. He has the mid-Atlantic vowels of one of the D.J.'s at a Virgin megastore. Devoted and loyal in carrying out the orders of the government, Preston stumbles into the underground when it turns out that one of them was (gasp) right next to him -- his own Cleric partner, whom he executes. 
His confidence shaken because he thought himself intuitive enough to know what was going on in the mind of any man, Preston is given an ambitious and perhaps even more empathetic young partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs, whose cheekbones are even more beautiful than Mr. Bale's). And there are further fissures in Preston's resolve; his wife was also executed for sense crimes, leaving him a widower with two young children. 
When he starts to have, um, feelings for the beautiful underground member (Emily Watson) he has just arrested, a question arises: Will Preston forsake the road before him for the pursuit of real, live emotion? 
''Equilibrium,'' which opens nationwide today, is pretty silly stuff. The writer and director, Kurt Wimmer, has obviously made a movie where independent thought has been banished, since the whole picture looks like Ridley Scott's Orwellian Apple commercial from 1984. I'm as up as anyone for a well-staged action sequence, but the punches thrown here make the movie look as if it was based on a video game. 
The Clerics' fascist chic wardrobe and their Gunkata will probably have the makers of ''The Matrix'' scouring every frame for copyright infringement. The true sleaziness comes after Preston beats a brace of fellow cops to their bloody, picturesque deaths to protect a puppy from execution. Just when you think ''Equilibrium'' can't sink any lower, the movie slaughters shame, too. 
''Equilibrium'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, gunfights, advanced pistol whipping, suggestions of immolation and threats to a tail-wagging pooch. 
EQUILIBRIUM 
Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer; director of photography, Dion Beebe; edited by Tom Rolf and William Yeh; music by Klaus Badelt; production designer, Wolf Kroeger; produced by Jan De Bont and Lucas Foster; released by Dimension Films. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽Extreme Ops‽,‽It is hard to say what ''Extreme Ops'' is a bigger waste of -- film or time. In this extremely boring stunts compilation, the hilariously named military strongman Slobovan Pavlov (Klaus Löwitsch), who is hiding out from the world in a remote winter resort under construction, is so stupid that he thinks a pack of wild, partying snowboarders is a group of C.I.A. operatives. He valiantly sets out to kill them. 
This burst of plot occurs in the final 20 or so minutes of the movie; its intense drama was broken only by the heavy footfalls of two of the five audience members leaving the theater. This may mean that the holiday box-office gross of ''Extreme Ops'' will be cut by almost half because they seemed out to collect a refund. 
Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing, moldering pile of, well, extreme stunt pictures, ''Extreme Ops'' mostly follows Ian (Rufus Sewell). This director of commercials and his production crew members are off to a spectacular snowy locale, where they are making an advertisement for a video camera, the Avalanche. 
Ian's partner, Jeffrey (Rupert Graves), who wears Burberry-tartan loafers, decides they will shoot the spot in an actual avalanche. Ian's right-hand man, Will (Devon Sawa), assembles a ski-stunt team. One of its members, Silo (Joe Absolom), is so intense he can be found skateboarding on the tops of trains or in airport baggage claim areas. Kittie (Jana Pallaske) is equally wild, and not at all interested in Will romantically, despite his puppyish entreaties. The video-bug Will uses a palm-size video camera -- a Panasonic, not the Avalanche -- to film everything, including a shot of Slobby Pavlov canoodling with his honey. (This, too, sets off that quick-tempered incognito war criminal.) 
It is hard to understand why ''Extreme Ops'' couldn't have been shown to critics before its release, because it seems to have been made in 1996 for ESPN2. When the would-be outlaws Silo and Kittie make fun of the championship downhill racer Chloe (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) because of her old-fogy sport, you wonder why she doesn't slap them back by saying that snowboarding is now so mainstream that it's an Olympic event. 
''Ops'' is too brain-dead to play the incognito war criminal segment for comedy, although when Will is seen thumbing through the pages of a newspaper called USA Daily, the picture has inadvertently tumbled down a Mad magazine wormhole. Mr. Sewell manages to keep his footing by giving the driest line readings imaginable; he is a true professional under the impression that he is in a real movie. (Ian's incredulity when he discovers that Chloe actually wears her gold medal will almost make this movie worth sitting through when it turns up on cable.) 
If ''Extreme Ops'' has anything going for it -- and believe me, that's one of the bigger ifs in movie history -- then that would be the stunt work. There is a fun scene of Will and Kittie boarding through billowing clouds of fresh white powder at night. And a sequence in which Will and Silo must dodge a pair of guard dogs while executing pratfall tumbles and flips in an unfinished wing of the ski lodge is eye-popping; the stunt coordinators earned their money on this one. 
But for those of you with more important holiday plans, like washing your hair -- and I'm sure there are many of you with such pressing schedules -- don't worry about missing ''Extreme Ops.'' Most of the stunts will probably be recycled in the opening of the next James Bond picture. 
''Extreme Ops'' is rated PG-13 for video-game-style extreme snow stunts, strong language and spin-the-bottle sexuality. 
EXTREME OPS

‽
‽Solaris‽,‽Whether gazing darkly over the ocean from a captain's perch in ''The Perfect Storm'' or contemplating the viscous, shape-shifting reality of a mysterious planet from a space station in his new movie ''Solaris,'' George Clooney projects the brooding solipsism of a man's-man encased in a shell of loneliness. In the Hollywood pantheon of recycled heroes, he suggests a Clark Gable for the new millennium, without the raised eyebrow and rakish leer. That space station, the setting for most of ''Solaris,'' is a gleaming, sterile pod that feels increasingly claustrophobic as this solemn science-fiction fable prepares to dispense its intriguing riddles. The world of ''Solaris'' may be a universe away from the frothy Las Vegas gloss of ''Ocean's Eleven,'' this star's last collaboration with Steven Soderbergh, who directed both movies. But Mr. Clooney's guarded insularity injects both films with steady dark bass notes. 
''Solaris'' observes its characters in semi-shadow much of the time. Mr. Clooney's eyes glisten through the gloom like shiny black coals studded into a craggy twilit landscape. 
But a third of the way into the film, Mr. Clooney's shell begins to crack. As his character, Chris Kelvin, starts to unravel, the grimy rivulets of guilt and longing leaking out of him lend the movie a palpable subterranean ache. Chris's tears aren't the warm, cathartic sobs of a grieving Rhett Butler softened by one too many brandies, but the tremors of a man who thought he had all the answers suddenly confronting a scary metaphysical conundrum. 
A psychiatrist called upon to investigate the increasingly irrational behavior of a crew posted at a distant space station named the Prometheus, Chris continues to mourn the suicide of his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), years after her death. As he confronts forces that might be described as a kind of virtual reality emanating from his own mind, his certainty of what is real and what is not begins to crumble, and a lifetime of stifled doubts and regrets rears up to haunt him. 
''Solaris'' was adapted from the Polish science-fiction writer Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel, which also inspired a 1972 film by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. The story turns out to be a kind of aesthetic Rorschach for filmmakers. 
In the hands of Mr. Soderbergh, collaborating with the producer James Cameron (who directed ''Titanic''), many of the fussy scientific and philosophical details of the two previous incarnations have been discarded. Retooled into a sleek pop fable that doesn't bother to connect all its dots, the movie aspires to fuse the mystical intellectual gamesmanship of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' with the love-beyond-the-grave romantic schmaltz of ''Titanic,'' without losing its cool. It's a tricky balancing act that doesn't quite come off. 
Because Mr. Soderbergh is the farthest thing from a pop sentimentalist, the movie's strain of Kubrickian skepticism dampens any Cameronian romantic heat. The chill is only accentuated by Cliff Martinez's ethereally melancholy score of synthesized pulses filtered through strings. 
Arriving at the space station, Chris discovers that the mission's commander, Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), who summoned him but refused to say what was wrong, has committed suicide. The two remaining scientists, Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Viola Davis), are exhibiting symptoms of acute paranoia presumably brought on by their scientific inquiries. Snow is a giggling, maniacal trickster, while Gordon refuses to leave her quarters. One tantalizing clue as to what's happening is the realization that the oceanic planet under examination seems to be reacting to the scientists' presence, as though it knows it's being observed. 
Once he awakens after a troubled sleep to find his dead wife lying beside him restored to life, Chris finds himself surrendering to the same unnerving phenomena. The heart of the film is his agonized dialogue with this flesh-and-blood phantom woman who seems physically real but whose selective memory suggests that she is only a mental projection of what he remembers of her. 
As the couple rake over their past, we learn that the bitterest bone of contention between them was Rheya's failure to inform Chris of her infertility before they were married. Now, in her resurrected state, she appears weirdly indestructible. 
The movie goes out of its way to emphasize that Mr. Clooney's Chris and Ms. McElhone's Rheya are no futuristic Leo and Kate locked in eternal puppy love but a sorrowful couple who weathered many battles while married. Her wide eyes staring hawklike out of her angular mask of a face, Ms. McElhone's Rheya projects a forbidding sensuality. Even when she becomes emotionally unstrung, her eruptions have the slightly robotic quality of the android she might well turn out to be. 
As the fable accumulates more layers of ambiguity, it recalls ''The Cage,'' the seldom-seen pilot episode of ''Star Trek'' in which the starship commander (played by Jeffrey Hunter) is disfigured in battle and imprisoned by a mentally advanced, but physically depleted tribe of telepathic aliens who use him for their pleasure. In the episode's ambiguously happy ending, he and an equally damaged woman end up living in a shared romantic illusion that becomes their captors' erotic entertainment. Heaven may exist, the episode suggests, but it's just a manipulated fantasy. 
In toying with some of the same ideas, ''Solaris'' throws in such enigmatic touches as the appearance of an unsmiling deific child extending its hand to Chris like Michelangelo's God creating the first man. But ''Solaris'' is too coolheaded to make a big fuss over such imagery. The last thing it wants to do is soothe us with grandiose assurances from the ''Touched by an Angel'' playbook. 
The movie, which opens nationwide today, is visually handsome in an austere way. Its space station, which from the outside resembles two interlocking bicycles, has an interior that suggests an elegant oversize Laundromat with furniture that reminds you of giant computer keyboards. Solaris itself is a golden, rainbow-flecked swirl of matter that exerts an increasingly irresistible gravitational pull. 
But once the novelty of the space station has worn off, the movie's atmosphere begins to feel uncomfortably cramped and stifling. For ''Solaris'' is a science-fiction film lacking action-adventure sequences. The absence of boyish friskiness, kineticism and pyrotechnics makes it a film that offers no vicarious physical release. Its insistence on remaining cerebral and somber to the end may be a sign of integrity, but it should cost it dearly at the box office. 
''Solaris'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and discreetly photographed moments of nudity.

‽Broken Wings‽,‽The performances in ''Broken Wings,'' Nir Bergman's aching domestic drama, are so finely meshed that the actors playing the Ullmans, an Israeli family shattered by the recent death of the head of the household, project the weary, lived-in kinship of people who have flailed in too close proximity for far too long. 
The unhappy realism of ''Broken Wings,'' Mr. Bergman's feature film debut, isn't pleasant to contemplate. Although plenty of love floats among the Ullmans, so do bottled-up rage, despair and guilt, which leak out in sudden explosions of hostility and self-destruction, and the volatility of family life gives you a sense of emotional claustrophobia. If only the Ullmans could get away from one another for a little while, you think, they would be so much happier. 
Dafna (Orli Zilberschatz-Banai), the financially strapped widow and mother of four, has recently taken a low-paying job as a night-shift midwife in a Haifa hospital after being bedridden for three months with depression. To hold down the job, Dafna reluctantly entrusts the care of her two youngest children, Ido (Daniel Magon), an alarmingly reckless 11-year-old, and Bahr (Eliana Magon), a sullen 6-year-old, to the oldest two, 17-year-old Maya (Maya Maron), and her 16-year-old brother, Yair (Nitai Gvirtz). 
Traumatized by their father's death and furious at having to shoulder responsibilities they would not normally have to handle, Maya and Yair are less than ideal candidates for surrogate parents, but they have no choice. Maya, an aspiring singer and composer for a rock band that is moving to Tel Aviv, is itching to flee Haifa. (Her touching song for her father opens and closes the movie.) Yair, a once promising basketball player, has become an indolent high school dropout who contemptuously counters friendly overtures with his bitter, nihilistic rants about there being no God and no truth. 
Yair and Maya are still considered too disruptive to be allowed back in school. Yair's latest opportunity for re-entry is foiled by his refusal to respond to the words father, fear and anger, tossed at him by a school counselor in a word association test. 
Maya rebels against Dafna by repeatedly ignoring or forgetting her instructions. When one of her small acts of forgetfulness precipitates a grave new crisis, Dafna snaps. One afternoon, Ido, unsupervised, pursues his favorite daredevil pastime, jumping into empty swimming pools. This time he hits his head and goes into a coma. 
The movie's sense of emotional claustrophobia is underscored by a complete lack of interest in Middle Eastern politics, or in anything outside the troubled family unit. ''Broken Wings,'' which opens today in New York, doesn't have a word to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nor does it give a sense of the existence of that conflict as background noise in the Ullmans' lives. 
Though incisive, the screenplay (by Mr. Bergman) resorts to some coy strategies to drum up a modicum of suspense. Although we're told of the father's death fairly early in the film, the actual circumstances aren't revealed until near the end. We also wait to discover whether Ido remains comatose. 
For all the sourness and impatience that erupt out of its characters' misery, ''Broken Wings'' makes you believe in the Ullmans and in the power of their mutual love to see them through. In the end, it suggests, given half a chance, we go on. 
''Broken Wings'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity and some strong language.

‽Confessions of a Burning Man‽,‽Directed by Unsu Lee and Paul Barnett 
Not rated, 80 minutes 
''Confessions of a Burning Man,'' an incoherent documentary about the annual Burning Man arts festival in the northern Nevada desert, makes the fatal flaw of cinematically imitating the anarchistic spirit of the event it observes. The 10-day festival, which draws more than 25,000 people annually to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, where a temporary city is created and then disassembled, is a kind of modern-day Woodstock festival with a new-age, survivalist, environmentally sensitive aesthetic. 
The participants complete and then remove large, fanciful artworks, many of which have a magical, childlike charm. At the center of the festival is a giant wooden effigy of a man that is ritually burned each year. While the festival lasts, it is often a battle against the elements. Despite the brutal environment, with its frequent sandstorms and extremes of temperature, the festival becomes a giant outdoor circus cum science fair cum art project peopled with jugglers, clowns, yoga instructors and nudists, euphorically cavorting into the wee hours. 
Although there is much to say about the history, aesthetics and philosophy of Burning Man (its founder, Larry Harvey, does a lamentably sketchy job), the film, which opens today in New York, is too lazy and too loosely structured to accomplish much besides conveying some vivid physical impressions. There is no narrator, and the structure that exists is clouded by the new-age mumbo-jumbo of eight principal commentators. 
As these dull, inarticulate people ramble on about their personal traumas and breakthroughs, they suggest the largest, most self-centered outdoor therapy group ever assembled. In the matter of drugs the movie is patently dishonest. Although there is not a single mention of drug-taking in the entire film, it's perfectly apparent that the community spirit of Burning Man would be unimaginable without the fuel of mind-altering chemicals.

‽Peter Pan‽,‽Admirers of Peter Pan from J. M. Barrie's novel, rather than from the many stage and screen versions, will find a kindred spirit in P. J. Hogan, the Australian director whose film adaptation of the book opens nationwide today. 
Mr. Hogan's previous movies ''Muriel's Wedding'' and ''My Best Friend's Wedding'' do not at first glance seem to be the work of a filmmaker drawn to the spectacle and enchantment of modern children's entertainment. 
But the sharp, sometimes stinging emotional acuity he demonstrated in those spiky, heartfelt comedies makes him an ideal interpreter of Barrie's work. The Peter Pan books are intended to disturb as well as comfort; in seducing young readers into the pleasures of literature they also teache them to appreciate various forms of unhappiness. They are magical and exciting, but also frightening and sad; their beautifully balanced themes are the delights of childhood and the pathos of leaving it behind. 
Mr. Hogan understands both themes, and his filmmaking style is a perfect mixture of wide-eyed wonder and slightly melancholy sophistication. 
While Peter, played by 14-year-old Jeremy Sumpter, is appropriately dashing and adventurous, and Tink (Ludivine Sagnier) is as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. 
Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display her childlike eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that ''Peter Pan,'' beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. 
That aspect of the movie may bring a lump to adult throats, but in the meantime there are the sturdy delights of swordplay, Neverland ritual and flight. Mr. Hogan, the production designer Roger Ford and the cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine (who also shot Baz Luhrmann's ''Moulin Rouge'') conjure a Neverland of lurid purple shadows and thick, brightly colored foliage. Any version of ''Peter Pan'' depends on the vitality of its villain, and Jason Isaacs (who also plays the timid Mr. Darling, as well as the reptilian Lucius Malfoy in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'') is stagily vicious and histrionically self-pitying as Captain Hook. When Hook meets his end, as the children chant ''old, unwanted, alone!'' from the decks of his creaking ship, it is hard to suppress a twinge of sympathy for the poor old pirate. 
You also feel the grief of Mrs. Darling (Olivia Williams) as she pines beside an open window for her vanished children, and the loneliness of Peter. All of this feeling is a mark of just how thoroughly Mr. Hogan has succeeded in evading the sentimentality that infects so many recent children's movies. 
Imagination is dangerous, but the loss of imagination is deadly. Being a child is frightening -- there are certainly scenes here that will jolt the sensitivities of young children -- but growing up is painful. Like Barrie, Mr. Hogan grasps these difficult truths, and knows how to spin them into utter, uncomplicated delight. 
''Peter Pan'' is rated PG. It has swordplay and gunplay and a few violent Neverland deaths.

‽
‽Paycheck‽,‽John Woo directing a Philip K. Dick adaptation: that certainly sounds like the opposite of coal in the stocking, or as good as a gift certificate from RadioShack. At least it might have sounded that way in 1990. 
Since then Dick's posthumous legacy has suffered through movies like ''Impostor,'' and Mr. Woo made ''Windtalkers.'' 
For Mr. Woo, whose action-man motifs have been looted so thoroughly by other filmmakers that he could qualify for a creative version of Chapter 11, audience expectations are probably close to flatlining. 
Yet ''Paycheck,'' which open today nationwide, is surprisingly . . . ept given that it is basically a dumb movie about smart people. This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could expect from such a collaboration, especially when Ben Affleck, an actor whose calm exterior reflects an inability to project an inner life, enters the mix. 
Mr. Affleck is Michael Jennings, a hotshot who has put his electronic genius out for hire to steal the ideas and properties of corporations and then refine them for competitors. It almost sounds like the story of Microsoft Word versus Apple except that for legal reasons Michael gets his mind wiped clean by a dangerous medical process that nearly boils his brain. This procedure also eliminates Michael's memory of the entire period he spent at work, all for a paycheck. 
When a new, less dangerous memory-elimination procedure comes along, one that can safely do away with three years instead of a few months, Michael is invited by his old friend Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) to get involved in a project that could change the world and net Michael an eight-figure income. 
Michael will come out three years later with a larger bank balance, but with no idea of his accomplishments; it would be like winning a Golden Globe. The sleek, ascetic paranoia that Dick triggered in his short story ''Paycheck'' surfaces; it is the kind of home invasion of the mind and soul that inspired films based on the stories ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' (''Blade Runner'') and ''I Can Dream It for You Wholesale'' (''Total Recall''). 
For Dick, having one's psyche manhandled was the most staggering crime imaginable; a million dollars was a mad chunk of cheddar in his world, but even today people are subjected to worse manipulation on ''The Bachelor'' for considerably less. 
Dramatizing the terror that Dick saw in surrendering three years of one's life to someone else has fallen into the hands of a filmmaker whose techniques have been so rigorously studied and overused that Mr. Woo's life could be the subject of a Dick short story. 
But ''Paycheck'' the film is not shocking; it is merely facile and unsettling. The Michael's troubled look while wrestling with his decision suggests annoyance, as if he had to walk an extra block to find a Leaf and Bean, rather than any agony over yielding control of his existence. 
So ''Paycheck'' becomes a glib, scrambling action picture about Michael trying to pick up his life after emerging from his job and finding that everything has gone wrong: he is implicated in murder, and almost everyone on his tail is more interested in shooting first and asking questions later. And he has no memory to use to piece things together, just an envelope of personal possessions that don't match the items he had deposited three years earlier. His use of the stuff in the envelope makes ''Paycheck'' feel like a big episode of ''McGyver,'' and Mr. Affleck's confused sheepishness makes the conceit mildly entertaining. 
''Paycheck'' is not much of a movie, though Mr. Affleck and Mr. Woo have definitely done worse. It could have been directed by anyone; unfortunately, Mr. Woo's gift for exploiting tension in closed spaces deserted him so long ago that it could be declared legally dead. (But there is a motorcycle-and-car chase sequence that gets his juices going.) 
He works best with actors who understand the physical threat and plunge into the danger anyway. Paul Giamatti, as Michael's scientist pal, gets it. The ''Six Feet Under'' star Michael C. Hall, in his first feature film role as one of the cops prowling the situation room, is relegated to crossing his arms and raising a single eyebrow, a staple of too many recent Woo films. 
As for Mr. Affleck, he is showing signs of becoming a believable action star; his stick-boxing technique is better here than in ''Daredevil.'' He looks good in the man-of-action Oswald Boateng-styled suits, designed to give him a futuristic cross between the man in an Arrow shirt ad and a character in ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.'' 
Then again, most of the characterization in ''Paycheck'' is linked to appearance. For the sinister Rethrick, overzealous use of hair-care products makes the same impression that mustache wax did for silent-film villains. 
Only Uma Thurman, as Rachel, a co-worker Michael may have loved in the past, draws on feelings that seem connected to the real world. She is the victim of psychic loss of the kind Dick describes; the collapse of her features when gazing at an unsure Michael provides a fleeting sadness. And she delivers a pretty impressive drop-kick. 
Too bad it didn't occur to anyone to make her the lead. 
''Paycheck'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), which means the cast members must dodge a lot of gunfire and shattered glass while using strong language, consuming alcohol and suggesting sexuality. Happy holidays.

‽
‽The Young Black Stallion‽,‽The large-screen Imax film process is a form in search of content. Able to create an image several stories tall with crystalline clarity, this 70-millimeter format is so overwhelming that it upstages whatever material it presents. Call it the wow effect: when the viewer is knocked out by the visual splendor, it is difficult to concentrate on dramatic issues or become deeply involved with fictional characters. 
The most successful Imax films have been documentaries like ''Space Station 3D'' and ''Everest,'' special-effects films and travelogues designed to show off the medium's potential without too much distracting information. Disney's''Young Black Stallion,'' opening nationwide , joins the small pool of films that have dared to use Imax to tell a story. 
But it is a very small story stranded in a very large space. Based on a 1989 children's book by Walter and Steven Farley, the picture is a prequel to Walter Farley's ''Black Stallion,'' memorably filmed in 1979 by Carroll Ballard. 
In the North African desert shortly after World War II, an Arab girl, Neera (Biana G. Tamimi), becomes separated from the caravan that is taking her from her ruined home in the city to her grandfather's formerly regal estate in the wilds. She is befriended by the frisky young colt of the title, which not only leads her to her grandfather's home but helps the family reclaim its lost greatness by winning a traditional high-stakes race against some neighboring tribal leaders. It is Neera of course who rides the young stallion to victory, scoring an anachronistic (but by now obligatory) feminist point. 
With its relative dearth of incident Jeanne Rosenberg's screenplay is ideally suited to the 45-minute length imposed by the Imax format. Most of the movie is rightly devoted to stunning landscapes (shot in Namibia and South Africa, rather than the north) in which sand dunes and mountains seem to extend forever. The amazing depth of field of the Imax image is highlighted by several shots that seem interpolated from regular 35-millimeter cameras: fine enough under most conditions but disappointingly flat when so much else is so highly dimensional. 
The Australian filmmaker Simon Wincer is a veteran of many children's adventure films, including ''Free Willy'' (1993), and he delivers a clean, straightforward product here. A bit of flavor is added by Richard Romanus, the actor best known as the silky apprentice godfather in ''Mean Streets,'' who here borrows Omar Sharif's accent and toothy smile to play the kindly grandfather. 
Still, it is supremely easy for the eye to wander away from the tiny exchanges of dialogue in the foreground to the towering wonders of nature in the background. The format has yet to find a director who can balance characters and landscape within the Imax frame, as Raoul Walsh did in the pioneering 65-millimeter wide-screen epic of 1930, ''The Big Trail,'' or David Lean with the Super Panavision 70 format of ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' 
Walsh and Lean found reflections of their protagonist's inner states in the landscapes that surrounded them, a metaphorical approach that turned mere spectacle into genuine epic. Imax is still waiting for its transformative figure.

‽
‽Cold Mountain‽,‽Were it not for a gruesomely violent battle sequence at the beginning, a smattering of profanity and an occasional glimpse of unclothed flesh, ''Cold Mountain'' might easily be mistaken for the product of an earlier era of movie-making. The film, freely adapted by Anthony Minghella from Charles Frazier's best-selling novel, is an episodic romance that begins like a war movie and ends like a western, and it requires an old-fashioned critical idiom to do it justice. It is, as my predecessor Bosley Crowther might have said, one heck of a classy picture. 
I mean this both as sincere praise and as a qualification of that praise. ''Cold Mountain,'' at once generous and self-congratulatory, full of lush scenery and large emotions, clearly longs for a home on the video store's classics shelf. To speed its passage, it arrives laden with the trappings of prefabricated cultural prestige, including a high-toned literary pedigree and a lustrous cast of past and future Oscar winners and nominees. The film, opening nationwide today, thus follows in what has become a Miramax holiday tradition of highly polished, and often lifeless, literary adaptations, including ''The English Patient'' (also directed by Mr. Minghella), ''The Cider House Rules'' and ''Chocolat.'' 
Fortunately, ''Cold Mountain,'' which stars Jude Law and Nicole Kidman as would-be lovers separated by the cruelty and privation of the American Civil War, distinguishes itself from such middlebrow conversation-stoppers. Its sober good taste is enlivened by large doses of intelligence and humor, and even a touch of authentic cinematic grandeur. 
By authentic I mean utterly artificial. Mr. Minghella, who can be overly solemn in pursuit of realism, is, thank goodness, also entranced by the beauty of exotic landscapes and the charisma of movie stars. Ms. Kidman, playing Ada Monroe, a citified preacher's daughter stranded in the remote hamlet of Cold Mountain, N.C., has never been lovelier, and her radiance at once challenges your disbelief and compels you to suspend it. Even dressed in cast-off men's clothes and struggling against the rigors of 19th-century rural life, she looks as if she had stepped from the pages of a glossy magazine, her eyebrows and cuticles painstakingly attended to. This incongruity adds to the movie's charm rather than dispelling it. 
And in nearly every particular -- including the soundtrack, which blends Gabriel Yared's lavish symphonic orchestration with Appalachian fiddle breakdowns and Deep-South Sacred Harp vocal harmonies -- the movie's elegant fakery improves on the book's stiff pretentiousness. The gothic landscape of Romania (beautifully photographed by John Seale) stands in for the hills and hollows of western North Carolina, and the plain country people who inhabit the novel's mock-folksy episodes are impersonated onscreen by a platoon of well-respected actors, many of them British, who drawl their vowels and clip their consonants into approximations of Southern American dialect. 
Mr. Law's accent is probably the most convincing, and his matinee-idol features are, for much of the movie, camouflaged by grime, fatigue and an unkempt beard. One peculiarity of ''Cold Mountain'' is that it is a love story in which the two romantic leads share little screen time and often seem to inhabit separate movies. In early flashbacks, Ada and Inman, Mr. Law's wry, taciturn character, trade flirtatious glances and share a rushed farewell kiss, but mostly they are apart, clinging to the dim prospect of reunion as a survival strategy. 
The story's pathos comes from the disproportionate intensity of their longing. They barely know each other, and their love is an attempt to conjure an idea of happiness in grim times. 
Inman, wounded in the battle of Fredericksburg, steps out of the window of a squalid Virginia military hospital and undertakes a long inland trek toward home. Ada, after the death of her father (Donald Sutherland), must contend with a harsh lifestyle for which her cosseted upbringing has left her unsuited. To help Ada manage her father's sprawling farm, her neighbor, Sally (Kathy Baker), sends over a no-nonsense spitfire named Ruby (Renée Zellweger), instigating a friendship that becomes the film's central relationship. 
Ms. Zellweger, wild-haired and ornery, clomps through the scenery like a migrant from Li'l Abner's Dogpatch. Her earthiness warms up ''Cold Mountain'' considerably, and her scenes with Ms. Kidman have a loose, improvisatory rhythm missing from much of the movie. They work together like a seasoned comedy team, and Mr. Minghella makes the most of their differences in temperament and appearance. 
While Ada grapples with farm work and the unwelcome attentions of Teague (Ray Winstone), an officer in the Home Guard who terrorizes the people of Cold Mountain in the name of the faltering Confederate cause, Inman slogs through a landscape populated by figures out of old murder ballads and tall tales. 
Mr. Law, a hint of mischief lingering around his tired eyes, meets up with a parade of Hollywood hillbillies, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi and Eileen Atkins. (Among the very few black people he sees is a silent, briefly glimpsed band of runaway slaves.) Alternating between these encounters and Ms. Kidman' s home-front stoicism, ''Cold Mountain'' unfolds in lyrical counterpoint. 
Its awkward beginning -- a jumble of flashbacks, voice-overs and confusing combat scenes -- reveals the structural challenge Mr. Minghella faced in adapting the novel, which seesaws between the present and the past and includes numerous digressions and side narratives. Imitating it too faithfully would have killed the film's fragile momentum, but Mr. Minghella, working with the matchlessly resourceful editor Walter Murch, has tightened Mr. Frazier's ungainly tale while preserving its epic capaciousness. 
The result is a mountain of honest, nourishing corn, a lavish evocation of simplicity that, for all its showy sophistication, has an appealing emotional directness. For all its sweep and scope and movie-star magic, ''Cold Mountain'' is studded with fine small moments and deft supporting performances, notably from Ms. Atkins, Ms. Portman and Brendan Gleeson, who plays Ruby's wayward, fiddle-playing father. 
The final assault on the heartstrings is marred only by the inevitable sex scene, a concession to modern sensibilities that makes you long for the old days of Production Code repression, when instead of a few minutes of peekaboo montage and heavy breathing, Inman and Ada would have consummated their love with a blown-out candle, a closed door, and a few wispy clouds suggestively passing across the moon. 
''Cold Mountain'' is rated R. It has graphic battle scenes, nudity and period-appropriate profanity.

‽Mona Lisa Smile‽,‽''You can bake your cake and eat it too!'' says the reassuring slogan that distills the comfy revisionist feminism informing ''Mona Lisa Smile.'' That slogan is repeated empathically enough to qualify as the defining mantra of a movie that pretends to be audacious. And the lurking duplicity in that loaded word ''bake'' (remember Hillary Rodham Clinton's sarcastic remarks about baking cookies?) winds up applying to the movie itself. Like ''Down With Love'' earlier this year, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' preaches disruptive female self-empowerment out of one side of its mouth while out of the other it invokes the dream of being swept up, up and away by Prince Charming. 
A miscast but irresistible Julia Roberts stars as Katherine Watson, a free-spirited Californian who moves East to teach at demure, snooty Wellesley College in 1953 and shakes up the place enough to be deemed subversive by the institution's hawk-eyed thought police. The insistence with which Katherine presses her mildly progressive agenda at the elite women's college makes her a kind of academic Erin Brockovich, or so the movie wants us to believe. And in her art history classes, which inspire the screenplay's most intelligent writing, she challenges her students to do more than simply identify paintings shown in slides. 
Why is an original van Gogh a work of art and a reproduction not? she asks. And where does a do-it-yourself, paint-by-numbers van Gogh fit into the scheme of things? The early 50's also brought the ascendance of Abstract Expressionism, and the appearance of a Jackson Pollock canvas on campus stirs up ripples of controversy. 
But Katherine's biggest boo-boo has nothing to do with notions of aesthetics. Arriving at Wellesley, she is appalled to discover that almost to a person, her brilliant, privileged students have no postgraduate ambitions beyond settling down with Mr. Right, having babies and baking sugar cakes for hubby. Her rebellion culminates with an indignant, heretical slide show of vintage magazine ads displaying perky, smiling Stepford wives reigning like queens in their immaculate kitchens. 
The movie, which opens nationally today, was directed by Mike Newell, whose popular films ''Four Weddings and a Funeral'' and ''Enchanted April'' tease you with the same glimmerings of something loftier before settling into a warm and fuzzy niche. Like his fellow Briton Richard Curtis (''Love, Actually,'' ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' ''Notting Hill'' and the screenplay of ''Four Weddings''), Mr. Newell is master of the feel-good ensemble piece whose shallowness is partly masked by the expertise of a high-toned cast. 
A star-watcher's guilty pleasure, the movie rubs together three of Hollywood's brightest younger stars -- Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal, all playing Wellesley seniors -- and throws in an appealing newcomer, Ginnifer Goodwin. Topping off this marshmallow sundae are vivid turns by Marcia Gay Harden as the world's prissiest (and weepiest) teacher of elocution and poise, Juliet Stevenson as the discreetly lesbian school nurse with progressive ideas about birth control, and that empress of hauteur, Marian Seldes, playing the intransigently starchy college president. Dominic West, as a carnivorous-eyed professor of Italian who sleeps with his students, gives the movie its requisite shot of testosterone. 
If Ms. Roberts is the undisputed star of ''Mona Lisa Smile,'' she graciously allows her acolytes plenty of opportunity to sparkle. Each plays a specific type. Ms. Dunst is Betty Warren, a vicious, overprivileged alpha girl and archtraditionalist hellbent on marriage to a louse, who attacks Katherine in the college newspaper. 
Ms. Stiles is Joan Brandwyn, Betty's best friend and Katherine's protégée, who finds herself torn between marriage and Yale Law School. Ms. Gyllenhaal, who almost steals the movie, plays Giselle Levy, the wised-up class rebel who sleeps around and almost loses her bearings. Ms. Goodwin's character, Connie Baker, is the house wallflower (and chief victim of Betty's cruelty) who can't believe it when a boy asks her out. Although the four are stock figures, the talented actresses shade their stereotypes enough to lend them as much humanity as the formulaic screenplay (by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal) permits. 
As the story follows Katherine through her first year at Wellesley, there are enough reversals to keep you guessing which characters will escape this upscale cuckoo's nest, although it's not very hard to figure out. Although Ms. Roberts is playing a grown-up academic, the aura she wafts is as ingenuous as ever. She is still the wide-eyed but feisty people's princess and angel of common sense whose high-beam smile can melt steel. Think of ''Mona Lisa Smile'' as ''The Best of Everything'' meets ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.'' Or better yet, ''Goodbye, Little Miss Chips.'' 
''Mona Lisa Smile'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for strong language and mild sexual situations.

‽
‽The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King‽,‽After the galloping intelligence displayed in the first two parts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, your fear may be that the director, Peter Jackson, would become cautious and unimaginative with the last episode, ''The Return of the King.'' Look at what ''The Matrix'' did to the Wachowski brothers; the last two were like action movies made for CNBC. 
But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His ''King'' is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. A sequence in which a number of signal fires are lighted on a stretch of mountain ranges simultaneously is a towering moment; it has the majesty that every studio's opening logo shot sprains itself striving to achieve. 
Mr. Jackson does take his time, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, ''The Two Towers,'' with its pounding and operatic martial fury -- a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging -- can be found here. 
Yet by its end ''King'' glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the ''Rings'' movies, with an epilogue that is tinged with regret. It's been a long time since a commercially oriented film with the scale of ''King'' ended with such an enduring and heartbreaking coda: ''You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.'' It's an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale pop action film. 
The closest thing to a recap of the previous films, ''The Fellowship of the Rings'' and ''Towers,'' this picture supplies is showing Gollum (Andy Serkis) as a regular hobbit -- Smeagol -- before he was subsumed by his appetite for the glittering One Ring and transformed into a larval creature that looks like the worm Smeagol is shown putting on a hook. It's the One Ring that the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) has to transport to Mordor and destroy it there. 
The collaboration of actor and director -- Mr. Serkis and Mr. Jackson -- for Gollum is a frighteningly believable realization of computer imagery as performer. Gollum, whose phyllo-dough skin still masks his abrupt and fully felt changes of heart, is as emotionally rich a creation as any actor's work this year. A dialogue he has with his reflection in a pond courses with invective and self-disgust. All of Mr. Jackson's glib, funny pranks in ''Heavenly Creatures'' and ''The Frighteners'' -- in which we were never supposed to be sure what was going on -- prepared him for a dramatic application of those techniques here. (He also employs his haunted-house dexterity in a formidable sequence with a giant spider.) 
Gollum's push-pull, divided between his hunger for the ring and his fears, makes him the most tragic figure in the movie. He preys on Frodo's weakened spirit, looking for the moment he can get the ring away and kill them both. The cursed ring pecks away at Frodo's humanity, as Gollum hammers away at the hobbit's remaining panes of will. The only thing keeping the wizened yet infantile goblin at bay is Frodo's loyal ally and sworn protector, Sam (Sean Astin). By making Gollum as integral a part of this tableau as Frodo and Sam, not only is there an important plot point at stake, but the movie is also frosted with misery. 
That mournful note echoes as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and his forces ready for their assault on Sauron's forces, the orcs. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, realizes that Frodo and Sam are on a suicide mission: ''There never was much hope. Just a false hope.'' Sir Ian's eyes move slowly, filled with mystery and pain. 
There is a sacrificial cast to the entire endeavor. The dwarf warrior Gimli thrives on this fatalistic bent, and is given a wry heedlessness by John Rhys-Davies; his charm-offense basso rumble is also the voice of the lord of the forest, Treebeard. The pitilessly sure elf warrior Legolas (Orlando Bloom, whose physical élan fills out the role) observes ''a sleepless malice'' watching over them. The hobbit Pippin has a much bigger role in this battle, and Billy Boyd is up to it, allowing Pippin to mature. 
Aragorn has the slinky swagger and dreamy stubble that make him look like a legend created by Tolkien, Sam Shepard and Ralph Lauren. Fortunately Mr. Mortensen also has a touch of modesty as an actor, which allows him to take up space as if he belongs in the center of the frame rather than battling the other performers for it. 
Pippin's pal, Merry (Dominic Monaghan), joins the fight, too, pulled along by Eowyn (Miranda Otto, touchingly ferocious). Ms. Otto stakes a worthy claim for every moment of screen time, while poor Liv Tyler, as the elf princess Arwen, is limited to dialogue that sounds like a spoken portion of a Spinal Tap album. Cate Blanchett's Galadriel hardly appears at all, and Hugo Weaving, as the elf lord Elrond, arrives just in time to answer a trivia question. (Who is the best-known Australian actor to appear in the ''Matrix'' and ''Rings'' movies?) 
The actors all look older than they did in ''Fellowship,'' and it fits the strategy of employing the same cast over an extended period for the films. This decision adds fresh dimension to the lingering sadness, as we can see some of the bloom worn out of their flesh and sadder, reddened eyes on all of them. 
Their battle weariness is appropriate given whom they are up against. The orcs and their terrifying behemoths of burden have a surreal confidence in victory; they even turn the phrase ''Release the prisoners'' into a threat. Sauron's misshapen foot soldiers and their collection of mutated animal freaks look as if they've crawled out of the sewers of Love Canal looking for summer work. 
''King,'' which opens round the country tomorrow, features more prognostication and exposition than its predecessors. Yet despite all of the setups required, Mr. Jackson maintains tension. In ''Towers,'' the director and his fellow screenwriters, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, secured a spiritual fidelity to the novel. In ''King'' they manage that and far more; the last third is especially condensed, and Aragon's role in the last battle is fleshed out. But the Tolkien search for purity is central to their ''King,'' too. And the movie isn't as exclusionary as the books' implicit Christian forcefulness, which made Middle Earth a re-creation of the Crusades. 
''King'' is the product of impressive craft and energy. The ''sleepless malice'' is aligned with controlled chaos; the sizable exertion of concentration from Mr. Jackson is multiplied by his ''Rings'' team, including his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie; composer, Howard Shore; production designer, Grant Major; and the battalion of other artisans responsible for the costumes, makeup and special effects. 
It is evident that the grip of ''The Return of the King'' on Mr. Jackson is not unlike the grasp the One Ring exerts over Frodo: it's tough for him to let go, which is why the picture feels as if it has an excess of endings. But he can be forgiven. Why not allow him one last extra bow? 
''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' is rated PG-13 for a stunning mastery of violence and intense scenes of bloodletting.

‽Something's Gotta Give‽,‽About two-thirds of the way through ''Something's Gotta Give,'' Diane Keaton bursts into tears. Her character, a divorced, middle-aged playwright named Erica Barry, has seen her quiet life of professional fulfillment and romantic disappointment unexpectedly disrupted by love and then, in short order, by heartbreak. Erica's sobs, sniffles and wails seem endless and uncontrollable, expressing every conceivable combination of hurt, humiliation and anger. Her crying jag, which seems to last for several months, continues without interruption through a half-dozen cuts and scene changes, carrying Erica through nearly every room in her large, airy East Hampton beach house. 
But ''Something's Gotta Give,'' which opens nationwide today, is a comedy. At the sneak preview I attended last week, the harder Erica cried, the harder the audience laughed, which I might have found disturbing if I had not been laughing so helplessly myself. 
This mirth was not cruel or derisive; it was instead an odd but nonetheless apt measure of the audience's sympathy and affection for Erica and a tribute to Ms. Keaton's unparalleled comic skill. Nobody else working in movies today can make her own misery such a source of delight or make the spectacle of utter embarrassment look like a higher form of dignity. Erica is by turns prickly, indecisive, uptight, vulnerable, self-assured and skittish: traits Ms. Keaton blends into a performance that is at once entirely coherent and dizzyingly unpredictable. 
The smash hit play Erica eventually writes -- her delicious revenge on the man who caused her such pain -- is called ''A Woman to Love,'' which would have been a much better title for this unusually satisfying comic romance than the empty and generic one it has. Erica lifts the phrase from one of her two suitors, a smooth-faced, star-struck young doctor named Julian, played in tongue-in-cheek Ralph Bellamy deadpan by Keanu Reeves. The movie is built around the wonderful and entirely persuasive conceit that both Mr. Reeves and Jack Nicholson could find themselves hopelessly smitten with an intelligent and accomplished woman in her 50's. 
Mr. Nicholson plays Harry Sanborn, a rich, 62-year-old bachelor who has devoted his life to philosophy: the Playboy Philosophy, circa 1966. Harry prides himself on never having dated a woman over 30, and at the start of the movie his babe of the moment is Erica's daughter, Marin (Amanda Peet). 
Mr. Nicholson may not, strictly speaking, be playing himself, but he seems to have prepared for the role by studying a few decades' worth of interviews and magazine profiles celebrating his unapologetic libertinism. And if his casting is an obvious joke, it is nonetheless a good one, thanks to his devilish combination of high-spirited rakishness and old-school gallantry. 
After suffering a heart attack during a bit of hanky panky with Marin, Harry finds himself under Erica's reluctant care, stranded in her house, where the rules of bedroom farce are strictly enforced. Logy and disoriented, Harry stumbles into Erica's bedroom and sees her naked, an event that casts an awkward pall over their relationship as well as foreshadowing its eventual consummation. 
''Something's Gotta Give'' was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who has, from ''Private Benjamin'' to ''What Women Want,'' demonstrated a thorough, if not always breathtakingly original, flair for the conventions of mainstream quasi-feminist comedy. She and Ms. Keaton have worked together before, in the yuppie crisis comedy ''Baby Boom'' and the retrofitted ''Father of the Bride'' pictures, in which Ms. Keaton was unimaginatively relegated to the role of Steve Martin's patient wife and obliging straight man. 
''Something's Gotta Give,'' true to form, does not really depart from the genial, sentimental formulas of its genre. Some of the jokes are flat, and some scenes that should sparkle with screwball effervescence sputter instead. But what Ms. Meyers lacks in inventiveness she makes up for in generosity, to the actors and therefore to the audience. 
Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Keaton -- last seen together, in rather different circumstances, as Eugene O'Neill and Louise Bryant in Warren Beatty's ''Reds'' -- spar with the freedom of professionals with nothing left to prove, and Mr. Nicholson has the gentlemanly grace to step aside and let Ms. Keaton claim the movie. She in turn brings out the best in everyone around her. Mr. Reeves, liberated from the Matrix and the burden of being the One, mocks his own mellow blandness but conveys his character's ardor for Erica without the slightest hint of facetiousness. 
Frances McDormand, as Erica's sister, a professor of women's studies, sidesteps the temptations of caricature and tosses off some of the movie's funniest lines. Ms. Peet, zany and appealing in an underwritten role, continues her steady, zigzagging growth into one of the most interesting (and, by this critic at least, often underestimated) young actresses around. If she keeps it up, she could be the next Diane Keaton. 
Which, as of this writing, is about the highest praise I can confer. After Erica's tears have dried, she and the audience are rewarded with a giddy, Lubitschean third act, which swirls through Manhattan and the Caribbean before touching down -- but of course -- in Paris for a sweetly predictable denouement. If Erica's distress makes you laugh, her richly deserved joy might just bring a tear to your eye. 
Julian had it right: she is a woman to love. ''You're incredibly sexy,'' he says to her at one point. 
''I swear to God, I'm not,'' she replies. 
I swear to God, she's wrong. 
''Something's Gotta Give'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for nudity, profanity and other grown-up stuff.

‽
‽Stuck on You‽,‽It's probably fitting that portions of the new Farrelly Brothers' chewy but minor comedy, ''Stuck on You,'' are set during the winter in a resort town -- Martha's Vineyard -- like their first picture out of the toboggan chute, ''Dumb and Dumber.'' Both movies seem to come out of a taste-free zone partially inspired by Rankin/Bass, the animation studio responsible for the holiday stop-motion, self-pity classics like ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' 
Bobby and Peter Farrelly's creations -- this time it's the conjoined 32-year-old twins Bob and Walt Tenor -- reside happily in a landscape like the Island of Misfit Toys. For the Tenor boys, it's the small town where they run a thriving diner, Quickee Burger, in which they guarantee to get the food to the table in three minutes, no matter how big the order. 
With ''Stuck on You,'' which opens nationwide today, the Farrelly Brothers have a big, steaming order to deliver. They must compete with the legacy of their own bad taste, for which they compensate with a quality that some may find even more repellent -- sentimentality. It's a much funnier movie than the trailer would lead you to believe; it would almost have to be. But it is just not as consistent as their previous trash wallows. 
Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear) are country mouse and city mouse who are actually joined at the hip; the directors bring the double-sided motif closer together than ever before. Bob is happy slinging burgers, while Walt aspires to be an actor -- a successful one, that is. He's already the biggest thing in their hometown, where he stars as Truman Capote in the one-man show ''Tru.'' Some of the funniest stuff in the movie involves the comparison of Robert Morse's version to Walt's. It's a little more amusing than Bob's having a panic attack at the prospect of having to be onstage, though badly hidden, with his brother. Yet Walt is the kind of ambitious comet who might be played by Mr. Morse -- he's an audacious operator who's gifted at charming everyone. 
While Walt succeeds without really trying, Bob hides under his bangs and maintains an e-mail relationship with a girl he's been writing to for three years but hasn't met. When Walt decides it's time for the brothers to move to Hollywood -- ''I think I got the chops,'' he says of his motivation, an utterly absurd situation that's treated seriously -- he convinces his younger brother by saying it's a chance for Bob to see his Internet honey, May Fong (Wen Yann Shih), in person. 
Walt has less of their liver than Bob -- it's how the movie explains why a separation surgery would be risky, since there's only a 50-50 chance that Walt would survive. (It's also the excuse for Walt looking older; Mr. Kinnear is seven years Mr. Damon's senior, but that doesn't explain why he seems to be wearing Jeff Daniels's hair from ''Dumb and Dumber.'') 
But after 32 years the Tenors have become a marvelously functioning machine by necessity and because of affection. (We get a flashback of their athletic achievements that includes a cameo by the Dolphins running back Ricky Williams as their high school football coach.) 
Walt's gargantuan optimism gives the movie a soul; it needs one since it barely has a look. The scenes set in the Hollywood residential hotel where they live look even faker than Walt's hair. On the other hand, the twins' relocation to Los Angeles gives the Farrellys a chance for the most glamorous shot of their careers, a camera move that starts with a palm-frond-view of Hollywood Boulevard and descends to the street. 
For the unshakable Tenors, this is their arrival in dreamland -- they're oblivious to the sleaze -- and it's highlighted by another Capote reference: Andy Williams's swoony warbling of ''Moon River,'' from ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' (Other equally corny songs mixed in are a Dolby-in-selected-theaters version of ''Moonlight Feels Right,'' as well as ''Wild Horses'' and, as the boys work their grill, ''Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire.'') 
The twins' curvy, swerve-on neighbor April (Eva Mendes, charming though she didn't need to lose so much weight for the part) vibes with Walt's conquering attitude, even though she's a few lumens short of a porchlight. And he gets an agent, Morty O'Reilly (Seymour Cassel), who's so out-of-touch that he probably thinks the ''Happy Days'' episodes on Nick at Nite are first-run; his eyeglass frames are big enough to carry those shows. 
Walt's dynamism leads to a run-in with Cher (as herself), who wants to use him -- that is, them -- to get out of a network television commitment. In order to sabotage the deal she hires Walt as a co-star to play her partner in a crime-stopper series, which also seems to have been lifted from the same 70's era that Morty is stuck in. 
Walt plays a wise-cracking police scientist and Cher is a tough-talking lawyer, sporting Solid Gold dancer ensembles similar to the outfits she wore in 1987's ''Suspect,'' where she really did star as a lawyer. (She earns a good sport award here, to go with her Oscar.) The laughs come with the handling of Bob on the set, rather than the attempts to parody a show that might still have a place on CBS -- after all, they did recently retire ''Matlock.'' 
The Farrellys, working with the writers Charles B. Wessler and Bennett Yellin, are at their best when they pair the movie's optimism with opportunism. The directors gleefully sink to wielding the producing studio, Fox, as de facto product placement, along with several other back-shelf products that you may have forgotten about. 
And there is a last cameo that returns a performer who also has forgotten roots -- in musical theater -- to the stage for the big finale. The one thing that connects all of the Farrellys' movies is inclusion, and eventually -- some might cringe and say inevitably -- ''Stuck on You'' does so as well. The story of the Tenors finally alights on a passage that could be from ''The Wizard of Oz'' -- there's no place like home. 
''Stuck on You'' is rated PG-13, (Parents strongly cautioned), which means that it gets away with a mountain range of undernourished double-entendres, strong language, tricky conjoined twin fistfights and alcohol consumption.

‽Love Don't Cost a Thing‽,‽''Love Don't Cost a Thing,'' proclaims the title of Troy Beyer's film, but affection is a little more expensive. The going rate here is $1,500 for two weeks, which is what Alvin Johnson (Nick Cannon), a geeky high school student, indirectly pays Paris Morgan (Christina Milian), the most popular girl in his Long Beach, Calif., high school class, to pretend to be his girlfriend for two weeks. 
Alvin, who wears a circa 1972 Afro and clothes that seem to have been gathered from a Robert Hall sample sale, is an accomplished amateur engineer, a finalist in a national contest sponsored by a car company for a new engine design. But knowing your way around a camshaft doesn't count for much in the buppie environment of Alvin's school, where being a star on the basketball team is the one sure way to attract female attention. 
Alvin lures Paris into his debt when she crashes her mother's car, and only Alvin has the technical expertise and the $1,500 in cash needed to make the repairs before Mom gets back from a vacation. Alvin restores the car, and Paris keeps her part of the bargain. She asks Alvin to hang out with her cool friends, takes him shopping for Sean John clothes (a blatant commercial plug) and invites him to parties where his nerd friends are turned away at the door. 
Alvin does grow more popular, and Paris, chastened for her snobbery, starts to fall for him. But in his rush to acceptance he has left his old friends behind, a classic movie mistake, since naturally he will need his pals to get him out of the scrape he will inevitably encounter in the final reel of the film, which opens today nationwide. 
If all this seems slightly more familiar than usual even for a formula teenage film, it may be because the screenplay (by Michael Swerdlick) had already been used for the 1987 film ''Can't Buy Me Love,'' starring Patrick Dempsey. Ms. Beyer, the director (and sometimes actor, in films that include ''B*A*P*S'' and ''John Q''), has reworked the screenplay with some African-American references, though the material remains essentially unchanged. 
Lessons are learned, including the importance of loyalty, the need to see through appearances to essences and the wonder-working properties of blindly believing in yourself. But there are unlearned lessons, too, including the one about the propriety of a teenage girl's entering into a relationship that, whether or not sex is required, amounts to soft-core prostitution. 
The cast is uniformly high spirited and attractive, and Ms. Beyer's direction, apart from a few over-weighted Wellesian camera angles, is functional. 
''Love Don't Cost a Thing'' has been rated PG-13 (''Parents strongly cautioned''). It contains some saucy dialogue and a cheerleading routine that would steam up glasses on the old 42nd Street. 
‽
‽The Last Samurai‽,‽There is probably no director more obsessed with the complexity of patriotism -- an unusual subject to plumb in mainstream films -- than Edward Zwick, who is driven to question the imperatives of an America that his protagonists both love and detest. His latest movie, ''The Last Samurai,'' falls squarely into the realm of the previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, ''Glory,'' ''Courage Under Fire'' and ''The Siege.'' 
And I do mean squarely. ''Samurai'' is a mythic western that combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in Japanese culture: John Ford's ''Lost in Translation.'' It depicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate, terrifying fervor across the very wide screen. 
And this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses his polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the first hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven ''Samurai'' is a can-do movie that's far more effective at communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more intimate ones. 
Mr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army officer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer's Last Stand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop, demonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren lumbers through the clichés he's hired to recite before blasting away at targets -- though the whiskey oozing from his pores probably makes him more of a danger than the weapon -- a sudden ember of regret flames in this ex-soldier's eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the horrors of a campaign in which he and his troops slaughtered innocents. 
Algren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest question is not whether he'll wing an audience member with a stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense, cast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester folks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of all the sleazy characters he's ever portrayed). Bagley wants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The Meiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he's actually being pressured to by American business interests. 
Once in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous, underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against an enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Despite the imperial army's modern weapons, Katsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield their arms of the past -- swords and spears -- with lethal effectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their arrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto's men were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren's troops of their backbones -- and their lives. 
In their ritual armor, Katsumoto's men make quick work of their foes; there's tragicomic relief as Algren's conscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their guns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto's second in command, he's captured by the invaders and, even more bewildering, cared for by Katsumoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered. 
It's a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated, too: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard. Algren is full of himself, even though he's conceived as a man who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised Custer. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly puffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that he's survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a worn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted, if not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse narcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution (though Mr. Cruise's good-boy posture works for a man reared under the disciplinary rigors of the military). 
Although at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary for the 19th century -- at one point, he seems to be waiting for a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of Details magazine -- this displacement fits better when he becomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this strange new world through sounds; nothing he's hearing makes any sense to him. He's a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice Burroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got there eventually. 
The film includes notable performances by actors not drafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production. Billy Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he's rarely suggested before, plays Algren's former sergeant at arms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old friend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to Japan. Mr. Connolly's loose, hostile vivacity registers so clearly that it's obvious we won't be seeing very much of him. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn't have to present the face of tragedy. 
The far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr. Watanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of Japan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand classic ''Tampopo,'' Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically and spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is hard-won, especially when he's having pointedly thoughtful conversations with Algren that sound more like translations of ideograms than actual dialogue. 
The film never really explains how or why this resolute, isolated samurai learned to speak English better than the emperor. His fluency doesn't quite make sense, though it gives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than the inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren together. 
''The Last Samurai,'' which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz wrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan, super-glues together a host of contradictions. Unfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions that are older than the story the film is weaving. The movie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This is not only because of the handsome staging, but also because the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with verve and simplicity, more so than in the ''exchange of idea'' chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like statements being read into the Congressional Record by Nathaniel Hawthorne. 
Mr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira Kurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness of the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles themselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren has to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water; he's more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a lesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away from the ''wax-on, wax-off'' curriculum of ''The Karate Kid.'' In those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren can't suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways of the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an alacrity that's mandated for movie stars: flash-card education. 
The film's title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he had enough perspective not to make a white man ''the last'' in his novel. Even though ''The Last Samurai'' opts for Japan's cultural differences, all of the unmentioned hardships of a feudal society notwithstanding, the remaining honorable native here is an American. Is that a veiled way of saying that Japan's old ways were doomed after all? 
''The Last Samurai'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, including enough ritualistic bloodletting for a week on the History Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and a chaste hint of sexuality.

‽
‽Honey‽,‽''Honey,'' an upbeat little hip-hop fable that opens today nationwide, is not the kind of movie that will impress anyone with its originality. It may remind you, at various times, of ''Flashdance,'' ''Fame,'' ''8 Mile'' and ''Drumline,'' a list that could be expanded to include dozens of other movies about plucky young artists striving to make it big while remaining true to themselves and connected to the people around them. In this case the heroine is a cheerful, driven young dancer named Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba), who longs to break out of the hip-hop club scene into the world of music videos (from which the movie's director, Bille Woodruff, has emerged to make his feature-film debut). 
Honey's path is strewn with some familiar impediments, including a disapproving mother (Lonette McKee) who thinks her daughter's talents would be better suited to ballet, and a video director (David Moscow) whose interest in Honey may extend beyond those talents. But the movie is as sunny and high-spirited as Honey herself, and you don't worry too hard or too long about her or anyone else in it. 
Her ambition is balanced by civic-mindedness, and her self-confidence never gets the better of her easy generosity. In addition to bartending and working the cash register at a record store, she teaches hip-hop dancing at a community center in her Bronx neighborhood and tries to steer her young protégés -- in particular a troubled, gifted young man named Benny (Lil' Romeo, who shows some real promise as an actor) -- away from the clutches of the local drug dealer. 
Her ally and love interest is Chaz (Mekhi Phifer), a handsome barber who represents -- as Ice Cube did in ''Barbershop'' -- the values of hard work and community responsibility. While Chaz has no serious rival for Honey's affections (though she plays hard-to-get for a while), the movie does hint at a conflict between those values and the shallow, seductive glitter of show business. But Ms. Alba, lithe and charming though she is, is also too blandly perky to register much in the way of emotional conflict. And the script, by Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson, while heavy on incident and superficial complication, shies away from anything like real drama. 
What the movie offers instead -- in addition to frequent shots of Ms. Alba's bellybutton -- is a soundtrack bursting with well-chosen beats and a few cameos by real rap stars, including Jadakiss, Ginuwine and Missy Elliott. (Ms. Elliott surely deserves a movie of her own.) The kinetic energy of the music keeps this picture moving, and the presence of these stars gives it glamour and credibility, which, to fans like Honey and her friends, amount to the same thing. 
The ease with which Honey moves between the streets of the Bronx and the glittering whirl of the music industry reflects the current self-image of hip-hop itself, with its aggressive celebration of upward mobility and its simultaneous embrace of democratic, street-level authenticity. ''Honey'' brings out the wholesome, affirmative side of the hip-hop aesthetic without being overly preachy, and it offers a winningly utopian view of show-business success without real costs or compromises. 
''Honey'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and drug references, as well as a lot of dancing that is sexy without being overtly sexual.

‽
‽Bad Santa‽,‽Somebody needed to make a comedy out of all the holiday season hostility that goes up this time of year along with the decorations, and the light-fingered director Terry Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for the task. Their new film, ''Bad Santa,'' takes all the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. 
Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who is annually roused from sleeping one off in that most wonderful time of the year by his partner, Marcus (Tony Cox), a dwarf. Willie is a department store Santa, and Marcus plays his elf. As he does so, Marcus also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve it of valuable merchandise. On this tour they have ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. 
Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary ''Crumb'' and the his fiction-film debut, ''Ghost World,'' both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. ''Santa,'' which opens nationwide today, falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie Stokes anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot. A bar argument that nearly escalates into a particularly invasive fight in the parking lot is one funny example of Willie's talent. 
Mr. Thornton's performance is close to the surly distemper he showed in ''Tombstone'' as the round-faced, bratty gambler who simply couldn't stop erupting with childish sarcasm. Despite the long, gaunt face he's developed since then, suggesting an eloquence ennobled by silence, Mr. Thornton is much better and far more interesting as a compulsive talker with a bad taste in his mouth, a sensation he seems compelled to share with anyone within spraying distance. 
In the similarly themed 1998 comedy ''Scrooged,'' Bill Murray gave a prodigious performance, and that film might have been a minor classic if the direction hadn't been so bombastic. Mr. Murray was slated to star in ''Santa''; like him, Mr. Thornton is an ace at playing cantankerous, mouthy jerks in love with the sound of their own voices, men who lack the restraint or sense of shame to keep their dissatisfaction to themselves. 
Mr. Cox has the trickier task, playing someone who is half enabler, half-manipulator. But he manages to balance the roles while adding hints of devilish masochism: he knows why he hangs with Willie. 
Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton it functions as a kind of star chemistry; as Santa, Willie ladles his acid sarcasm onto the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne. He's the kind of minimum-wage jackal who's responsible for thousands of hours of therapy for his victims. 
Mr. Thornton used a bit of this wincing, twitching magnetic perversity in his turn as the James Carville-like adviser in ''Primary Colors.'' But now it's under the main spotlight. It's what brings other unfortunates into his orbit, like the clear-eyed sprite Sue (Lauren Graham), who has a thing for bad-girl activity that would put her on most Santas' naughty lists. Then again, there's probably no living person who could do enough dirt to end up on Willie's naughty list. 
Like many films by the Coen brothers -- they're executive producers and came up with premise -- the world of ''Bad Santa'' seems to be peopled by inhabitants of the lower depths, like the skittish and gullible department store manager (John Ritter, in his last role), who is extorted by Marcus into keeping Willie on the payroll. There's also the wily security chief (Bernie Mac, who looks like a suburban king in his Stetson and Western-accented polyesters) who isn't nearly as trusting or vulnerable. 
At the top of the unforgettable group of ''Bad Santa'' misfits is the chubby loner kid (Brett Kelly), whose runny nose and dead eyes mark him as schoolyard prey. (This boy could be a character right out of a comic by the ''Ghost World'' creator, Dan Clowes.) Willie treats the boy as prey: he moves into the kid's house while setting up the caper and drinking himself into brain atrophy. The scenes with the boy and with the child's oblivious grandmother (Cloris Leachman) aren't played for pathos so much as for shock. 
And Mr. Zwigoff shows the most comfort with this aspect of ''Santa.'' When it comes to the comedy, his brand of lingering deadpan pauses -- the perfect screen realization of underground comics -- isn't quite appropriate. A more conventional, even pushy, director could generate much bigger laughs, just because he'd deliver them on schedule. But Mr. Zwigoff isn't built that way, and though the staging is a little soft, the rest of the movie falls into place. Someone without his slacker temperament would also emphasize the pathos, which he won't or can't do. The actors are assured enough as performers that they compensate for Mr. Zwigoff's overdeliberate quality. The whole ragged, hilarious package is what makes ''Bad Santa'' such a treat. 
''Bad Santa'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for behavior that would get even Santa kicked out of a county lock-up: odd violence, strong language, drinking and idiosyncratic sexuality. 
‽
‽The Missing‽,‽Apparently the only thing tougher than endurance on the frontier is sitting through a movie about endurance on the frontier -- at least that is the point ''The Missing'' seems determined to make. Amazingly, what it also seems to be saying is that nearly 50 years after John Ford's ''Searchers'' we have arrived at a point in film history when the movie industry can offer a less sophisticated version of the same material. 
Overly sensitive and disdainful of her tough life, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) longs to escape the grim cabin she shares with her healer mother, Maggie (Cate Blanchett), and little sister, Dot (Jenna Boyd), in New Mexico territory in the 1880's. But teenage Lilly gets away from home in a way she never bargained for: she is kidnapped by renegade Apaches who plan to sell her into slavery once they enter Mexico. 
And she suffers. Lilly is subjected to everything but a Senate confirmation hearing and an appearance on ''The O'Reilly Factor.'' But ''The Missing'' mutes the sexual paranoia that jerked John Wayne's face into a grimace in ''The Searchers,'' in which he was eaten alive by the possibility that his abducted niece had become involved with her captor. Despite torrents of brutality, much of it coming after Lilly's botched escape attempts, there is no danger of rape from the scrupulous villains in ''The Missing.'' (The kidnappers may be more naïve than their victims.) As a result this is a movie that exists only from the shoulders up. Just before Lilly is snatched away, Maggie's estranged father, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones), returns home, and there's already tension between Lilly and Maggie. The abduction forces Maggie to team with the father she reviles because she needs his help to track down Lilly. This situation is an intriguing way for the director, Ron Howard, to play to his chief strength and interests: the knotty and peculiar emotional crosscurrents that buffet families. 
This feels like a thoughtful attempt to give the depiction of home life some weight, a quality not evident in Mr. Howard's previous work. The steeliness that links Maggie, her father and Lilly are evident in their stubbornness and inability to communicate their simplest needs. The first 20 minutes or so of prologue provide a bare-bones melodrama unleavened by sentimentality, as the equally willful presences of Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Jones square off against each other. (There is a suggestion of sexual violence in Maggie's past after her father abandoned the family, though it is mentioned only briefly.) 
After the mission of ''The Missing'' begins, though, the movie starts to feel like Stephen King's ''Little House on the Prairie.'' The kidnappers' ringleader, the horribly scarred Chidin (Eric Schweig), is a cross-cultural menace: a brujo as adept at casting evil spells as he is at keeping his filthy band of brothers in line. 
His cruelty, which peaks in a horrifying scene that shows Lilly what her enslaved future holds, is explained in a bizarre subplot about freebooter American soldiers looting the home of slaughtered settlers. It threatens to offer political explanations for Chidin's rampage, but really only serves to extend the running time of the picture. (This section does feature a welcome appearance by Val Kilmer as a useless martinet Army officer.) 
As do a number of other movies this season, ''The Missing'' uses the power of mysticism to add a level of psychological import. But it seems only reminiscent of the austere nature-spirituality of ''The Last of the Mohicans'' and eventually provides just a flirtation with magic, which is a respite from the more salient plot points. 
Maggie and her father come to understand and respect each other, and eventually the bleakly beautiful cinematography rendered by Salvatore Totino blossoms into dappled sunlight, something John Ford would never have sunk to. Well, not that often, anyway. 
Mr. Howard's restlessness as a director is muted by his need to spell things out while bringing them to a rousing and well-manicured close. That worked to his advantage in ''Apollo 13,'' in which concentration, ambition and corniness meshed. But here, despite the performances he gets -- the young Ms. Boyd is as good and determined as the adults -- he seems to have something else on his mind, perhaps remembering ''The Alamo'' project he never got to make. 
''The Missing'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for extended displays of violence -- slaughter, skinning, stabbing -- but there is no sex.

‽
‽The Haunted Mansion‽,‽The Disney fright comedy ''The Haunted Mansion,'' starring Eddie Murphy in another of his put-upon dad roles, is an anomaly: no frights and no laughs. The price of the popcorn-and-drink combo at most theaters showing this film is scarier. 
Given its rejection of conventional staples like laughs or scares, ''Haunted Mansion'' is almost like a bit of Zen wisdom: When you can snatch the entertainment from my movie, grasshopper, it is time for you to leave. The director, Rob Minkoff, should do that, in another picture ground from a Disney theme-park attraction. It's clearly only a matter of time before ''Parking Lot: The Movie'' and ''People-Mover: The Motion Picture.'' Who's to say these films would not be more diverting than ''Mansion,'' which exists primarily to make ''Cat in the Hat'' seem a piece of beveled nuance by comparison. 
''Haunted Mansion'' does seem beveled, actually; about all it has going for it is John Myhre's production design and all the work that went into creating the title ''character,'' which is as expressive as most of the cast is allowed to be. The mansion, Gracey Manor, is occupied by a ghost, Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), who killed himself centuries ago in response to his lady love's suicide. 
Jim Evers (Mr. Murphy), a real estate agent, is summoned to the manor with his wife, Sara (Marsha Thomason); tough-girl daughter, Megan (Aree Davis); and arachnophobic son, Michael (Marc John Jefferies). And the breathtaking Sara has an amazing resemblance to the late lady of the manor; or, as Jim puts it, a ghost is trying to get jiggy with his wife. 
Mr. Murphy's current core audience -- the 4-to-11-year-olds taking a break from ''Even Stevens'' on television long enough to get to a theater -- was amused by such lines at the weekend screening I attended. The adults sat without responding for so long that I think they forgot why they were there. 
They may have gone because Mr. Murphy still has such audience rapport that he can create expectations, and he retains the reflexes of an entertainer. ''Mansion'' provides a reminder of those gifts, since it reteams Mr. Murphy with Terence Stamp, his co-star in the often funny ''Bowfinger.'' And since another Disney theme-park-attraction-turned-movie, ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' defied expectation and turned out to be so surprisingly good, this film promised possibilities. 
But it is finally a movie that doesn't really want to evoke reaction; it lacks even the cheesy fear quotient that a movie like ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' could dredge up. And Mr. Murphy is left to fall back on his mechanical sketch version of displaying terror, which only makes the picture seem even more insubstantial. As special guest apparitions, Wallace Shawn and Jennifer Tilly get a few chuckles, mostly by using their standard inflections to deliver the nonsensical lines. 
''Haunted Mansion'' does pose a few interesting philosophical questions: queries from the beyond, so to speak. For instance, do the gorgeous and talented African-American actresses, in seemingly inexhaustible supply, who are employed to shake their heads and frown as Mr. Murphy's wives, get upset because there isn't much else for them to do in the movies these days? Does Mr. Murphy wonder if there's a middle ground between family comedies and the forgettable action fare like ''Showtime'' and ''I Spy'' for him to parade his considerable talents? 
There's plenty of time to ponder such mysteries while watching ''Haunted Mansion,'' the film equivalent of the dark, boring period on a haunted house ride before the gondola crashes into another room filled with dirty mirrors. 
''Haunted Mansion'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild scares and because someone at the M.P.A.A. may have been frightened by the Nelly song playing over the end credits.

‽Timeline‽,‽The clumsy, wooden, screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel ''Timeline'' suggests a particularly wretched episode of ''Star Trek'' tricked out with fancy fireworks and weighed down with a score that grinds away like a cement mixer. The pyrotechnics, in which battling 14th-century soldiers catapult fireballs into each other's fortresses, may be diverting. But from the beginning, this fantasy of time travel, in which a group of contemporary archaeologists plunges through a wormhole in the time-space continuum to land in France in 1357, pounds you over the head with its noisy, ridiculous notions of medieval life. 
The movie, directed by Richard Donner, is so verbally stingy it feels as though it were written with a stopwatch. But that doesn't prevent it from lumbering on for just under two nearly intolerable hours. Now and then the interminable battles are suspended just long enough -- usually less than five seconds -- to shoehorn in a carefully staged, unsteamy smooch between one of the movie's two pairs of cardboard lovebirds. 
The more unlikely romance, between Andre (Gerard Butler), a bearded Scottish archaeologist and Lady Clare (Anna Friel), a 14th-century French aristocrat menaced by English soldiers, begins with the usual questions -- ''Are you married?'' ''No.'' ''Well, then are you 'with' anyone?'' -- and proceeds in a matter of minutes to snuggly commitment. Andre eventually has to make the ultimate Captain Kirk-worthy choice of remaining with his lady love in 1357 or returning to the 21st century. 
The other romance teams Chris (Paul Walker), the son of Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly), the chief archaeologist, with his dad's attractive, gung-ho protégé Kate (Frances O'Connor). With his pretty-boy face and talent-free acting, Mr. Walker, who became a star with ''The Fast and the Furious,'' resembles a throwback to the days when imitation Tab Hunters were tapped for potential stardom simply on the basis of their dimpled smiles and vacant, sparkly eyes. 
The demented brain behind the time machine, which can ''fax'' objects from one place to another and one time to another belongs to a ruthless scientist named Doniger (David Thewlis) who is determined to make history no matter the consequences. His treacherous spin doctor, Frank (Neal McDonough), is a glowering piece of duplicitous yuppie scum. The expedition is dispatched to retrieve the professor, who got stuck in the past. 
Unbeknownst to the travelers the device has not been perfected, and the chances of the party's safe return are dicey. Because ''Timeline,'' which opens nationally today, doesn't have a genuinely human moment, the travelers' fates are a matter of indifference. 
''Timeline'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a lot of stagy violence and some strong language.

‽
‽Gothika‽,‽In ''Gothika,'' a clammy new thriller that opens nationwide today, Halle Berry plays Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist at a Connecticut institution for the criminally insane. One of her patients is Chlöe (Penélope Cruz), a disheveled young woman who screeches and rants and claims that she is being sexually assaulted by the devil in her locked cell. One obvious symptom of Chlöe's illness, whatever it is, is a tendency to speak in lurid similes: ''He opened me up like a flower of pain,'' she says of her demonic attacker, and (about someone else), ''I sliced his adam's apple in half like a piece of fruit on a summer day.'' 
In that spirit you might say that this movie, directed by Mathieu Kassovitz from a script by Sebastian Gutierrez, is like a plastic houseplant that has been given too much water, or a wax apple that someone has tried to bake in a pie. It is a thoroughly synthetic confection, compounded of clichés drawn from a half-dozen genres and subgenres that for a while might almost persuade its audience, as it apparently convinced its makers, that it is something more. 
In the end, though, as the ghost-story clichés collide with the serial-killer clichés, and the women-behind-bars clichés give way to the wronged-women-seeking revenge clichés, the movie proves to be both too much and not enough: yet another slick, empty package of ersatz entertainment. 
After her frustrating session with Chlöe, Miranda saunters through the rest of her workday, oblivious to the sinister foreshadowings all around her. Mr. Gutierrez seems to have gotten some script advice from either Edward Bulwer-Lytton or Snoopy, since it is (perpetually) a dark and stormy night. The gloomy corridors of the Woodward correctional center are bathed in pale, bluish fluorescence, and the power is always on the verge of going out. 
Mr. Kassovitz and Matthew Libatique, the cinematographer, do an effective (if not terribly original) job of creating an atmosphere of dread, though the director is a little too fond of making the audience jump at nothing. The false scares are so numerous -- an umbrella popping open, a light going out, a barn owl flapping into the frame -- that after a while they diminish the impact of the really scary stuff, rather than heightening it. 
Still, for a while, ''Gothika'' will manage to quicken your pulse and keep you in a state of nervous anticipation. Driving home through torrential rain, Miranda sees a girl standing in the middle of the road. When Miranda tries to help her, the girl chatters and screams and then bursts into flame. The doctor awakens a few days later to find that she has become an inmate, having been locked up for murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton) -- who was also the director of the hospital -- with an ax, a crime she initially has no memory of committing. 
Her sort of kindly, sort of creepy therapist is Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.), a former colleague who had a crush on her and who now either wants to help her or is part of a conspiracy to drive her completely out of her mind. 
''I'm not deluded,'' Miranda insists, ''I'm possessed.'' The flaming girl continues to pursue her in that passive-aggressive way common to movie ghosts in the post-''Sixth Sense'' era, driven by an urgent need to communicate something and able to do so only by depositing maddeningly cryptic clues. The supernatural visitor writes the words ''Not Alone'' on fogged-up glass, in blood and, gruesomely, in the flesh of Miranda's arm. What she means is ''I was the victim of a homicidal maniac, and I need you to help me uncover his horrible crimes,'' but she lacks either the space or the spelling ability to say so outright. 
And I certainly will not spell out for you what you will, before too long, figure out for yourself, at which point all suspense and intrigue will evaporate. About two-thirds of the way through the screening I attended, the startled gasps were replaced by laughter, as ''Gothika'' began its headlong descent into incoherence. If I had left after an hour, I might have taken the film for a clever, if somewhat glib, exercise in terror, with Ms. Berry showing the appropriate mixture of helplessness and grit, and Mr. Downey adding a gleam of raffish intelligence. But of course I would have been deluded. 
''Gothika'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity, gory violence and strong language.

‽Suspect Zero‽,‽Finally, a serial-killer movie so preposterous, so garnished with accidental laugh lines and absent essential narrative logic it may actually put a permanent kibosh on this tediously overworked crime subgenre. Here's hoping, at any rate. Directed with self-conscious hothouse flair by E. Elias Merhige, from a puzzler of a screenplay credited to Zak Penn and Billy Ray, ''Suspect Zero,'' which opens nationwide today, involves a serial killer who's doing away with other serial killers and the disgraced F.B.I. agent who refuses to let this meta-murder madness go unpunished. Think ''Seven'' minus the talent. 
Soon after the agent, Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart), lands in the F.B.I.'s sleepy Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cactuses and sand. One thing leads to another, leads to a few more corpses and a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths. 
Aided by his reluctant partner (Carrie-Anne Moss) and some meager tactical support (played by, among others, the always valuable character actor Harry Lennix), Mackelway tracks O'Ryan, trying to discover what connects him to the bodies cluttering up the morgue. Because O'Ryan scatters the trail with clues as big as bread crumbs, it soon appears that the hunter and the hunted may be on the same horrific page even if the director and the screenwriters are not. 
Stuff happens, mostly by fits and starts. Children go missing, the venerable director and screenwriter Robert Towne (''Chinatown'') pops in for an amusing unbilled cameo, and dread seeps into the scenery only to be sucked into the vacuum of the plot. Mr. Merhige -- whose previous features are the sui generis cult item ''Begotten'' and ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' a fictional gloss on the making of F. W. Murnau's silent classic ''Nosferatu'' -- has a sense of the macabre and an eye for outré detail. But his grasp on genre niceties is less than firm, or perhaps he's just not interested in sticking to the straight and narrow. Whatever the case, Mr. Merhige routinely wanders away from the absurd main story to doodle in its margins, where he conjures up ghostly silhouettes, anguished camera angles and a derelict landscape washed in blood red. 
Despite the gothic filigree and Mr. Merhige's strained attempt to wed shivers with high-art allusions and a few empty political gestures (think Leatherface meets Marcel Duchamp under a wind-snapped American flag), ''Suspect Zero'' doesn't take long to collapse under the weight of its ridiculous conceit and the depressing specter of countless dead. Even draped in aesthetic pretension, exploitative schlock is still exploitative schlock. 
What it all means and how it adds up is, in the end, distinctly less interesting than how and why this half-baked project attracted movie-industry power hitters like Paula Wagner, the film's co-producer and Tom Cruise's production partner; Mr. Ray, who directed last year's acclaimed independent film ''Shattered Glass''; and Mr. Kingsley and Ms. Moss, both of whom do much more for ''Suspect Zero'' than it does for them. 
''Suspect Zero''' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes gruesome, often realistic-looking violence.

‽
‽Hero‽,‽In ''Hero,'' an ambitious period epic about the birth of the first Chinese empire, warriors fly through the air like birds of prey, their swords cutting through enemies and lovers alike. Set during the third century B.C., the story of an assassination plot against a powerful king unfolds with such dazzling bursts of color and blurs of furious action it might be easy to miss the nationalistic message tucked amid the visual enchantments. Roll over, Chairman Mao, and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool. 
And now this birth of an empire also comes with the imprimatur of Quentin Tarantino. The reigning king of Amerasian cinema, Mr. Tarantino has lent his name to ''Hero'' (it looms above the title), a bit of commercial calculation no doubt meant to seduce the director's fans, some of whom have probably already watched the 2002 movie on imported DVD's. 
Mr. Tarantino's name is a nice touch, but the real auteur here is the Chinese director Zhang Yimou, who until now has been known for far more modestly scaled features such as ''Raise the Red Lantern'' and ''The Story of Qiu Ju.'' ''Hero,'' which opens nationwide today, shows Mr. Zhang working in a new genre and on a new scale, and handling the demands of both with relative ease, which partly explains why the movie stands as the most successful release in China, second only to James Cameron's ''Titanic.'' 
The story takes off with the title character, a nameless warrior played by the appealing martial-arts film star Jet Li, en route to the kingdom of Qin, whose ruler hopes to unite the warring Chinese states into an empire. Once ensconced under heavy guard and the scrutiny of the Qin king (Chen Dao Ming), ''Nameless'' relates how he vanquished the king's most feared enemies, Sky (Donnie Yen), Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) and the most powerful warrior of all, Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). 
When the king rejects the account, Nameless spins a second, a third and finally a fourth version, changes in perspective that Mr. Zhang and his excellent production team signal with startling shifts of color that alternately flood the screen with a red as vivid as that of a Little Red Book, a spotless white, a delicate blue and a pale pistachio so mouthwatering you may want to lick the screen. 
Despite the modest complications of the film's flashback structure, the tale cooked up by Mr. Zhang and his co-writers Li Feng and Wang Bin is storybook simple. After a knockout fight between Nameless and Sky, which finds the opponents violently bouncing off a courtyard like squash balls, Nameless travels to the kingdom of Zhao, which is preparing for an attack from Qin. 
There, Nameless meets Snow and Broken Sword, warring lovers who have holed up together in a calligraphy school along with several dozen students, an old master and a comely young servant named Moon (Zhang Ziyi). Much of the rest of the film and certainly everything that makes this story more than soulless spectacle involves this ravishing ménage à trois, whose passions erupt as fiercely as any of the film's fights though often to more devastating effect. 
Filled with meticulous set pieces, including a showdown between Snow and Moon set among swirls of golden-yellow leaves, ''Hero'' is easy on the eyes, but it's too segmented to gather much momentum and too art-directed to convey much urgency. And at least for this viewer, the founding of the first Chinese empire weighs in as less compelling than Mr. Leung's melting eyes, Ms. Cheung's implacable beauty and Ms. Zhang's ability to flicker from rage to vulnerability with hummingbird grace and speed. This remarkable young actress, who first came to attention here in Ang Lee's ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' will next be seen in Mr. Zhang's ''House of Flying Daggers.'' That more recent period epic, which had its premiere to great acclaim at Cannes in May and comes out later this year, indicates that with ''Hero'' Mr. Zhang was just warming up. 
If ''Hero'' proves to be less than the sum of its attractive parts, it's nonetheless generally pleasurable. That's particularly true if you don't think too hard and long about the implications of the noble sacrifices various characters make in the name of a unified China or what this subtitled version of the film calls ''our land.'' (In at least one DVD copy the same phrase is translated as ''all under heaven.'') 
Many of Mr. Zhang's earlier features were initially banned in China and more recently he has directed state-sponsored films promoting China's successful efforts to serve as host for the next summer Olympics and World Expo. For better or for worse, Mr. Zhang's ability to provide the powers that be with palatable stories is apparently no longer in doubt and neither is his talent for putting on a really big show. 
''Hero'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film includes sword and arrow violence, discreet bloodshed and some emotionally intense exchanges.

‽Exorcist: The Beginning‽,‽Spinning heads, cascades of pea soup and your mother's Army boots are nowhere to be found in ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' but lovers of the ridiculous may be delighted to know that the specter of little Linda Blair a-twitch and a-tremble is not entirely forgotten. A prequel to ''The Exorcist,'' William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent and its very own bag of cheap tricks. But when push comes to demonic shove, hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup just as surely as some producers have no shame. 
''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' which opened nationwide yesterday and given its doleful prospects may soon be known as ''Exorcist: The End,'' is the third feature film to be squeezed from the pulpy remains of Mr. Friedkin's original. (That film spawned two less-acclaimed sequels, and four years ago it was re-released in theaters with some padding and tweaks.) Based on the William Peter Blatty best seller, the first ''Exorcist'' mostly entails the efforts of two priests trying to beat the devil out of Ms. Blair's 12-year-old with the aid of pop metaphysics and some exceedingly dated special effects. A monster hit and very effective for a certain teenager who must remain nameless, Mr. Friedkin's film has not held up well, but compared with this latest effort does vaguely resemble the classic of 1970's cinema its fans tout it as. 
''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was directed by Renny Harlin, whose previous efforts include a solid ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequel, a bad ''Die Hard'' sequel and the diverting thriller ''The Long Kiss Goodnight.'' Slick and devoid of any obvious personal signature, Mr. Harlin's directorial style is serviceable enough for a movie like ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' which exists solely to rake in cash during its opening weekend and settle into a long shelf-life in the DVD hereafter. 
As it happens, the DVD release will be more interesting than the theatrical one if, as floated in Variety, it includes the version of this prequel shot by the director Paul Schrader. Mr. Schrader was fired from the project on grounds that his prequel was not scary. Mr. Schrader, in turn, had replaced the film's initial director, John Frankenheimer, who died during preproduction. 
All this background noise, alas, turns out to be more interesting than what has managed to finally make it on to the screen. Written by Alexi Hawley, who was brought in to revamp William Wisher and Caleb Carr's earlier screenplay, ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' opens centuries ago with a priest stumbling through a landscape littered with bloodied corpses and the writhing bodies of the soon to be dead. From there it's a fast cut to Cairo circa 1949, where amid the putatively exotic third-world sights and sounds the Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard sits in a bar wearing the rumpled white suit and anomie of a B-movie hero. This world-weary traveler is, of course, Merrin, the same character played by the Swedish actor Max von Sydow in ''The Exorcist,'' but now without the sanctity of the priestly collar. 
What ensues essentially conforms to the movie horror manual, though the production does benefit from the talents of the Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who has given the film a nice nicotine-stain patina. Wrapped in this burnished orange glow, Merrin, having taken a mysterious assignment, creases his brow and tries to discover what a Catholic church is doing buried in the sand in northern Kenya (actually Italy's Cinecittà Studios), which is where most of the film's 117 draggy minutes play out. Along for the ride are the usual movie suspects, including a beautiful doctor with peek-a-boo décolletage and a fondness for late-night showering (Izabella Scorupco), a young priest straight from the Vatican (James D'Arcy), a helpful local with a bull's-eye fixed to his forehead (Andrew French) and various other sacrificial lambs, including children, all of whom are lovingly skewered with graphic detail. 
Despite the body count and Mr. Harlin's reliance on shock cuts and loud noises, ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' singularly fails to deliver any palpable shivers. Perhaps more expectedly, given the torturous production history and the unceremonious introduction of the movie (the studio didn't screen the film for critics until the night before it opened), it does afford the occasional and presumably unintended laugh. Still, despite the risible dialogue, the bulging eyeballs, the heaving bosoms, the digitally rendered hyenas and squirming maggots, the movie fails to achieve the status of the instant camp classic. That's partly because the vibe of the film is too torpid. It simply doesn't have the buoyancy of camp, but mostly because it's deeply unpleasant to watch children, even fictional children, murdered on the altar of greed. Thrills rarely get cheaper or more loathsome. 
''Exorcist: The Beginning'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for graphic bloody violence, including images of young children being shot and torn apart by animals.

‽Without a Paddle‽,‽As every red-blooded American male is at least partially aware, 1972 was the year camping trips lost their innocence. That was when the movie ''Deliverance'' introduced a new specter into the horror show of macho nightmares. Thanks to ''Deliverance'' and many subsequent rip-offs, every camper knows that behind every tree may lurk a sadistic, rotten-toothed hillbilly itching to rape a soft city slicker and make him squeal like a pig in front of his friends. 
The homosexual panic instilled by ''Deliverance'' fuels the running joke (if that's the word for it) driving the uneasy laughs evoked by the loathsome comedy ''Without a Paddle,'' which opens today nationwide. Three buddies, 30 going on 13, embark on a ridiculous treasure hunt in the Pacific Northwest. Although no rape actually takes place, the threat of it is a constant source of leering humor. When the treasure hunters run afoul of a pair of gun-toting marijuana growers who resemble outlaw bikers, rape, torture and murder seem probable punishments, should the campers be caught. 
Much of the movie is a frantic chase through the forest, in which the beer-bellied beasts pursue the wimpy city slickers. At one point, the friends hide in a treehouse where two nature-loving beauties are living an environmentally pure life. But even here, the dreaded possibility of androgyny raises its head, when one of the women (who don't shave) reveals a hairy leg. When the beasts arrive, the women's stored-up bags of excrement come in handy as stink bombs dropped from above. 
Later in ''Without a Paddle,'' directed by Steven Brill, the friends, shivering and nearly naked in a downpour, find themselves forced to curl up together in a ball to avoid hypothermia. Homosexual panic is exploited for easy guffaws as the companions, wincing in revulsion, cling to one another fearing the worst (a stray erection), and of course the worst happens. Much is also made of the fondness of Dan (Seth Green), the wimpiest of the three, for the old Culture Club hit ''Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?,'' an affection for which signifies possible gayness. Dan sings it out loud to combat his claustrophobia while squirming through a tunnel. 
To be fair, ''Without a Paddle'' is only the latest in a spate of teenage and post-teen buddy comedies to trade on gay panic for laughs. The movie, which pushes its ugly humor further than most, follows Dan (a doctor with a suitcase full of phobias), and his grownup childhood buddies Tom (Dax Shepard), and Jerry (Matthew Lillard) on their jaunt back to nature. Tom is a pathological liar with a bogus résumé as a whitewater rapids guide, and Jerry is an overstressed insurance executive with infallibly bad judgment when it comes to roughing it. 
The trip is inspired by the death of Billy, the fourth and most glamorous member of their childhood clique. As boys they used to fantasize searching for the $200,000 stash of a legendary bank robber who disappeared in the forests of Oregon. When they reconvene in their childhood treehouse after Billy's funeral, they discover the treasure map he drew, along with a cereal box compass, and decide to honor his memory by venturing into the wild and fulfilling his quest. 
In an early life-threatening mishap, they are menaced by a computer-generated bear with a taste for cellphones. The overlong bear sequence is so poorly coordinated that the animal poses no palpable physical threat. The movie's final joke and homage to ''Deliverance'' is the appearance of Burt Reynolds himself as a shaggy hermit who has lived in the woods for 30 years. With Mr. Reynolds consenting to lend his name to such a shabby enterprise, the joke is really on him. 
''Without a Paddle'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for abundant profanity and sexual innuendo.

‽Nicotina‽,‽''Nicotina,'' a grisly, comical shaggy-dog thriller from Mexico, provides the latest evidence that, a decade after ''Pulp Fiction,'' the international movement we might call Tarantinismo is alive and well. Or maybe just alive. 
''Nicotina,'' which opens today nationally, was directed by Hugo Rodríguez from a script by Martín Salinas, and while it demonstrates some formal ingenuity, it is for the most part a tasteless and derivative stew of overdone jokes, chronological tricks and labored shock effects. Mr. Tarantino has long since moved on (and can hardly be blamed for the extent of his influence), but Mr. Rodríguez and Mr. Salinas are still messing around with his discarded gimmicks, along with bits and pieces from other aggressively cool movies from the recent past, like ''Run Lola Run'' and ''Amores Perros.'' 
At the center of the plot, as you might expect, is a caper gone awry. A computer hacker named Lolo (Diego Luna) has procured some Swiss bank access codes, and his confederates, Nene (Lucas Crespi) and Tomson (Jesús Ochoa), plan to give them to some Russian mobsters in exchange for diamonds. Such work is a bit of a distraction for Lolo, whose vocation is spying on his pretty neighbor (Marta Beláustegui), a cellist whose every word and gesture makes its way to his desktop monitor. It says a lot about the filmmakers' sensibility that Lolo, objectively a creepy, unapologetic voyeur, is the most sympathetic character in the picture. 
Not that his feelings matter much. A movie like ''Nicotina'' runs on travestied emotions and daredevil kineticism. Mr. Rodríguez does have a good eye and an assured sense of timing, and he has assembled a cast of interesting actors, whom the story arranges into quarreling pairs. Nene and Tomson carry on a running debate about the dangers of smoking, which turns into a gangster philosophy seminar on the relationship between fate and coincidence. Meanwhile, two married couples, each running a small business, are drawn into the action: Carmen (Rosa María Bianchi) and Goyo (Rafael Inclán) squabble over money in their modest hairdressing salon, while Beto (Daniel Giménez Cacho) and Clara (Carmen Madrid) fight about mislabeled medicines and smoking in their pharmacy. 
Given the film's title, it is not surprising that smoking figures so prominently in the story. Each pair of characters, including Lolo and his neighbor, consists of a smoker and a nonsmoker, and the picture has the antic, irritable energy of a 90-minute nicotine fit. The narrative, which unfolds in real time, is punctuated by shootings and other acts of violence that are meant to serve as brutal punch lines, truncating colorful and surreal passages of criminal incompetence and domestic disorder. But sudden, violent death is not really all that funny, and the rising body count of ''Nicotina'' suggests that at the end, having boxed themselves into an elaborate and unconvincing story, Mr. Salinas and Mr. Rodríguez found themselves out of ideas and out of breath. 
''Nicotina'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for many scenes of graphic violence.

‽We Don't Live Here Anymore‽,‽For as long as anyone can remember, American movie actors have been exploring their vulnerable and sensitive sides. Masculine displays of unguarded feeling and agonized introspection may be the norm in serious dramas, but the depiction of genuine male weakness remains something of a taboo. Very few leading men are brave enough to risk appearing cowardly, indecisive or passive-aggressive, and ordinary men in the audience, observing these traits onscreen, are likely to decline the invitation to identify with them. 
We would much rather think of ourselves as stoic, fearless and empathetic, however distant our real selves are from these ideals. 
The willingness to appear weak -- to represent, in other words, a familiar variety of real, contemporary American man -- may be Mark Ruffalo's great distinction as an actor. Even when he plays cops, in pictures like Jane Campion's ''In the Cut'' and Michael Mann's ''Collateral,'' he does it with a visible tremble of hesitation. In Kenneth Lonergan's ''You Can Count on Me,'' the film that first brought him widespread attention, Mr. Ruffalo's character was generous and sweet-natured, but also feckless, selfish and unreliable, in perpetual flight from maturity. 
Jack Linden, the straying husband he plays in ''We Don't Live Here Anymore,'' a thoroughly intelligent, half-satisfying story of marital woe that opens today in New York and Los Angeles, is more solidly settled into the trappings (and traps) of adulthood, with a wife, two young children and a job teaching literature at a small New England college. But he is still, underneath his dutiful displays of grown-up responsibility, a petulant and manipulative boy. Jack is a complicated character -- a nice guy skilled in cruelty and betrayal, a thoughtful person who can't think straight about his actions -- and your response to him is likely to hover between sympathy and revulsion. 
This mixed reaction is only fitting. Mr. Ruffalo's asymmetrical face, with its soft mouth and large, worried eyes, was designed to show ambivalence, and the film, adapted from two novellas by Andre Dubus, is more interested in observing the nuances of domestic and sexual behavior than in judging its sad, confused inhabitants. Jack's weakness occupies the foreground of the story. (In the story that gives the film its title, he is the first-person narrator.) 
But he is only one player in an uncomfortable four-way game of envy, longing and dissatisfaction. He is sleeping with Edith (Naomi Watts), who is married to Hank (Peter Krause), a writer who is Jack's colleague, jogging partner and best (if not only) friend. Edith initiated the affair as revenge for Hank's earlier infidelities, and as a way of assuaging his own guilt, Jack nudges his wife, Terry (Laura Dern), into a dalliance with Hank. 
Compared with Jack, whose air of unease and self-doubt are part of his attraction, Hank has the smirk of a man who has it all figured out. Even at his moments of torment, when his writing is going badly, he exudes a smooth, knowing self-confidence. He and Edith have a little more money than Jack and Terry, and their house is quieter, cleaner and more modern. Jack's envy of his friend is palpable, even as it remains mostly unspoken. His affair with Edith is partly a campaign of covert aggression against Hank, and also against Terry, whose disorderly housekeeping and emotional volatility stand in vivid contrast to Edith's cool, genteel melancholy. 
All of this is, perhaps, a bit too schematic. The sneaking and coupling, the revelations and exposures that drive the narrative of ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' at times come close to the hectic door-slamming of bedroom farce; they might, at any rate, if the sex actually took place in bedrooms, or if the movie had a sense of humor. Dubus's plain-spoken prose has an undertone of Yankee wryness; the somber, autumnal quiet that governs his stories is broken, at crucial moments, by a crackle of laughter at the dogged ridiculousness that attends even moments of great distress. A hint of this survives in some of the dialogue that Larry Gross's screenplay has carefully lifted from Dubus's pages: Jack's odd, offhand use of the word carnivorous, for example, or the tinny grandiloquence he falls into during an argument with Terry. 
But this film's director, John Curran, who made the aching, unsettling bohemian romance ''Praise'' in 1998, is not inclined to rescue his characters with levity. The music, by Michael Convertino, lies over the action like a shadow, gathering force from time to time to create a vague, insistent feeling of dread. An uncanny suspense ripples through the movie. Some of its recurrent images -- a railroad crossing, a rushing river -- carry a premonition of mortal danger, and you watch nervously, certain that something terrible is going to happen. 
This anxiety, which is not altogether misplaced, turns ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' from a domestic melodrama into a kind of marital film noir. Emotional violence rarely seems so menacing, or so close to the real thing, and the murk and mystery of marriage, adultery and friendship have seldom been illuminated with such harsh precision. Ms. Dern forsakes all vanity and makes no obvious plays for the audience's sympathy, even though her Terry may deserve it more than anyone else. She and Mr. Ruffalo skulk around each other in a dance of petty resentment and maladroit tenderness, which climaxes in one of the most lacerating and believable scenes of imploding love since Diane Keaton and Albert Finney fell apart in ''Shoot the Moon.'' 
Mr. Curran and Mr. Gross rotate the story on its axis, shifting perspective to allow each couple, married and otherwise, a moment or two of intimate revelation. ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is a cracked, dark crystal of a movie, but what it lacks is an adequate setting. The film's scope is so rigorously limited to the two families that when Hank and Edith give a party (to celebrate the publication of one of his poems), the presence of other people comes as something of a shock. Wait a minute, they have other friends? How could that be? The four of them behave, for the most part, like survivalists stranded in the remote wilderness, dependent on one another almost to the point of cannibalism. 
Dubus wrote ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' and ''Adultery,'' the other novella that is the basis for this movie, in the 1970's, and some of this film's efforts to bring his characters into the present give off a mothbally whiff of anachronism. In some cases this is trivial, as when Hank makes a big show of burning the manuscript of his novel, which is an empty gesture or a redundant one because he composed it on a laptop. 
More awkward is the film's notion of marriage -- in particular of wifehood -- which seems to date not to the stripped-down short-story realism of the 70's but to the campus novels of the 50's. If Edith and Terry ever had professional or intellectual ambitions of their own, we don't hear about them. Their status as unhappy homemakers seems to result not from postfeminist choice, but from prefeminist habit. 
But if the social context of ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is blurry and unreal, what happens inside those marriages is anything but. Compassionate though it is, this is not a movie that offers much in the way of solace. It insists that there is no end to human weakness, and not much cure for it either. That's pretty strong stuff. 
''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sex and strong language.

‽The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement‽,‽In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for the new feature-length fairy tale ''The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,'' the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks English accented by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway), a onetime San Francisco teenager turned old-world pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. 
The story opens with Mia graduating from college (when we last saw her she was in high school) and zipping off to Genovia, which her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), hopes she will govern someday soon. As in the original ''Princess Diaries,'' much of the putative comedy involves the free-spirited Mia working in gentle, contrapuntal harmony with her veddy, veddy proper grandmother. Because the ugly duckling has already molted into a swan, however, the plot this time around hinges on some minor palace intrigue and romances with two blow-dried suitors who take turns holding the royal hand while keeping a safe distance from the royal chastity. In between the cooing and wooing, the pratfalls and product placements, Ms. Hathaway and Ms. Andrews flash smiles of such dazzling wattage they could carry California through its next energy crisis. 
''The Princess Diaries 2'' was directed by Garry Marshall, who has been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in ''Pretty Woman'' and in the first ''Princess Diaries'' movie. Mr. Marshall, whose place in pop-culture heaven was secured long ago by television comedies like ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' on which he served as a writer, is not much of a film director. Depending on the budget, his movies look either cheap (like this one) or studio slick (''Pretty Woman''), and tend to have the same flat, presentational visual style that's familiar from most sitcoms. (That's why his movies fit so snugly into airplane monitors.) And as in those sitcoms shot in front of live audiences, Mr. Marshall's actors often play to the camera and wait for laughs, which can be a serious problem when the screenplay is as deeply unfunny as this one. 
Built on vintage and newly minted clichés, Shonda Rhimes's script combines a classic storybook scenario with the usual self-help uplift. After undergoing a radical makeover in the first ''Princess'' movie, Anne has metamorphosed into a self-possessed young woman. She knows how to walk in high heels, iron the frizz out of her hair and whirl around the dance floor with ineligible partners without making them feel bad. True, her sexuality comes across as weirdly underdeveloped, closer to that of the preadolescents who constitute this G-rated movie's core audience, than that of most typical college graduates. But that's in keeping with the character whose appeal is largely predicated on being essentially unremarkable in every respect in looks, intelligence, personality and that most dubious of designated female traits, niceness. 
There's nothing wrong with being nice if it means giving succor to the poor and being kind to animals, but there's something unsettling about a character as bland, mushy and fiber-free as soggy corn flakes. Once upon a different time, Mia might have found her truest self by hanging out with the soulfully truculent adolescent girls in ''Ghost World.'' Instead, Ms. Andrews whisked in with a face frozen in do-re-mi beatitude and carried Mia off to a world where every unruly hair and thought is as smoothed down as the grass on a windswept Bavarian mountain. In the first film, Mia discovered she was to the manner born. Now, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake too.

‽
‽Collateral‽,‽IN ''Collateral,'' the edgy new thriller from the director Michael Mann, the city never sleeps; it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), and the assassin Vincent (Tom Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. As the pair cover the city, looping over interchanges and down wide open boulevards, they travel a landscape alive with wild animals and wilder men, noisy with unfamiliar music and chatter, and punctured by the hard pop of occasional gunfire. 
Following a few preliminaries, including some flirty minutes with Jada Pinkett Smith as a harried passenger, the story gets down to its dirty business with Vincent jumping into Max's meticulously clean taxicab. Nattily turned out in a gray suit and matching salt-and-pepper hair and light beard, Vincent takes the story precisely seven minutes east of downtown. 
With the meter running, Max waits for his fare, fetishistically poring over luxury-car brochures and fantasizing about the limousine company he hopes to start. Then a body lands splat on the roof of the taxi, shattering the cabbie's nerves and a large section of his front window, and Stuart Beattie's screenplay kicks into overdrive. Vincent, Max discovers to his horror, is a killer for hire, and this is only the first stop on what looks to be a very strange trip. 
Wired for action, ''Collateral,'' which opens nationwide today, initially seems like a return to basics for Mr. Mann, as exemplified by ostensibly straight early films like ''Thief,'' about a safecracker in love, and a retreat from the more self-consciously serious films like ''Ali,'' his underrated movie about the legendary boxer. 
The new film takes place against a backdrop that pits a drug cartel against law enforcement agencies presumably intent on shutting it down, and to that end features big, beefy men wielding big, scary guns and the jolting image of Vincent hitting his marks, specifically with two bullets to the chest and one through the head. But because Mr. Mann makes thrillers the way that John Ford made westerns, using genre as a way into meaning rather than as an escape, ''Collateral'' bears little relation to the usual Hollywood blowout. 
That becomes evident as Max and Vincent drive through the emptied-out streets and the story shifts from a two-hander to a road movie, a tourist-board nightmare and a bloodied valentine to the director's adopted hometown. A portrait of radically different souls clinging to radically different paths, ''Collateral'' hinges on the moment when fate intersects with choice. 
Vincent is clearly a nutcase, seething with inarticulate rage and locked-down demons, but he's also a man seemingly in charge of his destiny. For Max, who's been hanging onto his well-tended fantasy for years (''this is just part time,'' he repeatedly insists of his hack job), his passenger represents an imminent threat, but also a necessary wake-up call. For Mr. Mann, it always seems, there is nothing worse than a life on automatic pilot, not even death. 
Mr. Foxx can't have had an easy time playing foil to the world's biggest movie star, but he holds his own gracefully. For his part, Mr. Cruise, whose famous self-discipline has helped turn him into a bankable personality and a less-than-believable regular guy, makes Vincent scarily convincing. Underappreciated as an actor, Mr. Cruise is most at ease when he can deliver a good portion of his performance through his body. He's an intensely physical performer, one whose jumping muscles and athleticism often express the inner workings of his characters more plausibly than any scripted line. Clad in the sort of form-fitting, slightly too-short slacks favored more by modern dancers and Gene Kelly than (I assume) contract killers, he plays Vincent from the outside in, as a citadel of physical perfection and ability. 
That makes the star an ideal fit not merely for this role but for this director, whose male characters inevitably express themselves more through their deeds than their words. One of the signatures of Mr. Mann's films is that while his male characters tend to be tight-lipped (if often very loud and certainly dogged in their beliefs), the director's visual style and musical choices verge on the extreme, at times the operatic. Filled with incessant rhythms, washes of gaudy color and heartbreaking beauty, the films boldly convey the passions and deep feelings the director's men rarely voice. It's the sort of expressionistic gambit that pointedly makes the case that movies create meaning both with what's on the scripted page and with images of palm trees bobbing against a moonlit sky and the everyday Los Angeles surrealism of coyotes prowling an otherwise urban street. 
Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, ''Collateral'' scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up at night, how cars become prostheses of ourselves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, ''Collateral'' is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job. (It's no wonder the director gives the Sears ''Craftsman'' logo a loving nod.) Whether chasing fictionalized serial killers or those serial killers who run tobacco companies, Mr. Mann's men risk everything -- happiness, women, life itself -- to get the job done, which explains why these fastidiously executed commercial films are not just entertainments, but statements of personal faith. 
It's in this sense that despite the spent bullets and fallen bodies, ''Collateral'' is very much the product of a distinct vision, one as eager to push technological limits (the film was shot with the most advanced video cameras) as to upend the usual studio white-hero/black-villain formula. For the director, such casting isn't a sop to political correctness, but a reflection of his city's demographics. Unmistakably urban, Mr. Mann's Los Angeles is a city where not every black man knows how to handle a gun, where Korean and Latino revelers jam dance clubs rarely seen in pop culture and where a light-rail line nicknamed the Ghetto Blue promises salvation after a really, really bad night behind the wheel. Best of all, it's a city where, if someone asks with corrosive incredulity, ''Do you like it here?,'' the only plausible answer is, ''It's my home.'' 
''Collateral'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes a lot of very intense gun violence, some phony corpses laid out in an autopsy room and strong adult language.

‽
‽Open Water‽,‽In ''Open Water,'' a low-budget, digital-video feature, a vacationing couple spend many hours stranded in the middle of the ocean hoping not to be eaten by sharks. The film, written and directed by Chris Kentis and produced by his wife, Laura Lau, is a minimalist thriller, made without special effects, animatronic monsters or histrionically suffering movie stars. The sharks, whose fins occasionally pierce the surface of the water and whose implacable bodies are glimpsed gliding beneath it, are real. They show no particular hostility toward Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis), even as lunchtime passes and the dinner hour approaches. Susan and Daniel, meanwhile, drift from stoicism to panic toward exhaustion as the tropical sea ripples around them. 
The sharks are scary, and the ocean is vast and indifferent, but the most effective parts of ''Open Water,'' which is ultimately too modest to be very memorable, evoke a deeper terror, one that can chill even those viewers who would never dream of putting on a wet suit and jumping off a boat. Susan and Daniel, nondescript, stressed-out tourists staying in an unidentified Caribbean resort town, set off for a morning dive with a charter company that proves a little too easygoing. 
Somehow, the crew mixes up the head count, and the boat chugs away while Susan and Daniel are still underwater. This casual abandonment seems to fulfill a primal anxiety experienced by children who wander away from their parents -- not just a fear of being lost, but a dread of being forgotten. Whether or not Susan and Daniel survive the sharks and the elements, they have already, in a sense, ceased to exist, an implication driven home when the camera returns now and then to shore, where people dance and drink and shop as if nothing terrible could ever happen. 
The movie succeeds in mobilizing the audience's dread, but it fails to make us care as much as we should about the fate of its heroes. Mr. Kentis has taken pains not to make them too interesting, and Mr. Travis and Ms. Ryan oblige by not trying to act too much. At the beginning, before the boat sets out, we glean that things are not altogether harmonious between them: she is distracted by her work; he is passive-aggressively needy; their sex life seems tepid. 
These unexplored, hinted-at tensions blossom in the movie's best and wittiest scene, a spat that erupts after seven hours of treading water. As Susan and Daniel spit the clichés of modern couplehood across -- ''Are you saying this is my fault?'' ''Let's just drop the subject'' -- you can't help but laugh. 
And it's only under extreme duress that the two of them reveal any humor. ''Feel better now?'' Susan asks Daniel after he curses the incompetent charter company. ''Well I wouldn't say better, exactly,'' he replies. She also forgives him for watching ''Shark Week'' and diving adventure shows on television, though she does note that her preference would have been to go skiing instead. Given the circumstances, it's hard to argue. 
''Open Water'' feeds on the appetite for danger that such programs reflect. Like the semi-documentary ''Touching the Void,'' this film, based on a true story, titillates us with the dread of (someone else's) exotic death, and teases us with the illusion that what we are watching is real. The bland ordinariness of the characters, the flat colors and jerky rhythms of digital cinematography and the constriction of the drama give the picture some impact, but not much resonance. It pulls you in and then pushes you away, so that you leave saying, ''Wow, how awful'' without having experienced a full measure of awe. 
''Open Water'' opens today in New York City, Los Angeles and Orange County, San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, Seattle, Denver, Minneapolis, Detroit, San Diego and San Jose, Calif. The film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has brief nudity, profanity and the constant threat of grisly death.

‽Little Black Book‽,‽Batting the lashes of her large, vacant eyes and sucking her lower lip into a pout, Brittany Murphy suggests a dumbed-down Meg Ryan with a gloss of Melanie Griffith in the sweet but mostly sour comedy ''Little Black Book.'' The movie, which opens nationally today, aspires to be a dewy-eyed self-help fable for ambitious young women folded into a mean-spirited satire of Jerry Springer-style reality television. 
Offering few laughs and a climactic scene of breathtaking cruelty, this plot-heavy movie, directed by Nick Hurran from a screenplay by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell, draws you into its malignant force field against your will. 
Almost from the beginning, the film's sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another way, ''Little Black Book'' would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed ''Working Girl'' (with New Jersey replacing Staten Island as the plucky heroine's home base and Carly Simon's music pushing the story along) and a more acerbic ''Broadcast News.'' (That movie's star, Holly Hunter, appears as Ms. Murphy's most poisonous colleague). In trying to be both at once, ''Little Black Book'' can't hold a candle to either. 
Ms. Murphy's character, Stacy Holt, who narrates the movie in a too-cute voice, begins the film by describing her twin obsessions: Diane Sawyer and the catechism of romance according to Ms. Simon's hits. After a sketch of Stacy's childhood, we meet the grown-up Stacy, who is living in uneasy bliss with Derek (Ron Livingston), a dapper recruiter for a New Jersey hockey team and a man with a past who won't discuss his romantic history. 
Stacy's dreams of a big-time career in television inch one step closer to reality when she lands a job as an associate producer for Kippie Kann (Kathy Bates), a fading talk show host given to topics like ''Grandma's a Hooker, So Handle It.'' When Derek goes on a business trip, Stacy is coaxed by her colleague Barb (Ms. Hunter) into going through the Palm Pilot he accidentally left behind. There Stacy discovers several scrapbooks' worth of material on his ex-girlfriends, along with evidence that he remains in close touch with one in particular. 
The recently jilted Barb (the closest thing to a female Iago to come along in years) persuades Stacy to interview three of them by pretending to consider them as guests on the show. (Any thinking person in her right mind would, of course, say no). But Lulu (Josie Maran), a bulimic supermodel; Rachel (Rashida Jones), a gynecologist with a book to peddle; and Joyce (Julianne Nicholson), a rising chef, are only too happy to oblige. 
Stacy learns to her shock that Joyce, a hockey fan who still pines for Derek, is seeing him regularly as a friend. And in fact, Ms. Nicholson's Joyce is so much more attractive, capable and emotionally honest than Ms. Murphy's whiny, self-centered Stacy that the notion that he would trade in Joyce for Stacy is ludicrous. 
Although Ms. Murphy plays Stacy as an injured princess, the character's relentless treachery speaks for itself and outweighs her shallow contrition once her game is discovered. The movie also defeats both Ms. Hunter and Ms. Bates, two of our finest character actors. Ms. Bates is simply miscast in an unfocused role, and Ms. Hunter's transition from perky sidekick to psychopathic meddler is too big a stretch for anyone. The message sent by her character -- that mean girls only get meaner as they mature, especially without a man -- is hardly an empowering one for women. 
The very elements that the rest of the movie tries to weave together are reconciled in the frequent songs by Ms. Simon, which describe in a blunt, self-assured tone the feelings of jealousy, insecurity and sexual competition that can plague even the best relationships. If only the movie were half as honest and self-aware as its soundtrack. 
''Little Black Book'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sexual situations.

‽The Manchurian Candidate‽,‽THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE,'' which opens today nationwide, is Jonathan Demme's second attempt to update a classic cold war thriller. Two years ago, in ''The Truth About Charlie,'' he tried to drag ''Charade,'' Stanley Donen's suave Hitchcockian romance, into the messy, multicultural modern world, an admirable effort that unfortunately did not yield a very enjoyable movie, in spite of the charms of Thandie Newton. 
This time, using John Frankenheimer's original adaptation of Richard Condon's novel as a touchstone rather than a template, Mr. Demme has been more successful. Not only has he made a political thriller that manages to be at once silly and clever, buoyantly satirical and sneakily disturbing, but he has recovered some of the lightness and sureness of touch that had faded from his movies after ''The Silence of the Lambs.'' 
Some of the fun of his retrofitted ''Candidate,'' which opens with Wyclef Jean's bracing version of John Fogerty's ''Fortunate Son,'' comes from its playful acknowledgment of -- and frequent departure from -- the first version, which was released in 1962, just in time for the Cuban missile crisis. The very first scenes peek in on a long, raucous game of poker, and fans of Mr. Frankenheimer's movie may anticipate the fateful appearance of the queen of diamonds. But this, like other winking evocations of the old ''Candidate,'' is a tease. 
The game Mr. Demme and the screenwriters, Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris, are playing involves a different set of strategies and symbols, as well as altered stakes. 
The first ''Manchurian Candidate'' was an exemplary piece of liberal paranoia, imagining the nefarious collusion between foreign, Communist totalitarians and their most ferocious domestic enemies, a conspiracy of the political extremes against the middle. That film, which climaxed at the 1956 Republican convention in New York, looked back from Camelot at an almost-plausible alternative history with a mixture of alarm and relief. The center, in the solid person of John F. Kennedy's pal Frank Sinatra, had held. 
The new version, after a prologue in the first Persian Gulf war, unfolds at a time succinctly and scarily identified as ''today,'' and proceeds from the nominating convention of a major political party toward a frenzied Election Night finale, feeding on an anxiety about the future that is neither exaggerated nor easily assuaged. Sinatra's character, Maj. Ben Marco, is played by Denzel Washington, and this time Marco is not the cool, rational unraveler of a vast conspiracy, but rather one of its victims. 
The public, coming upon this movie in a fraught political season, may be more interested in identifying the perpetrators. Though the party in question is not identified, it does not much resemble the real-world party currently in power. In the movie the United States is subject to terrorist attacks, which have become so routine that they are mentioned only in passing, and is fighting wars in small countries around the world. 
The chief danger to the republic, however, emanates not from the extremes -- a fanatical foreign enemy combined with a zealous administration -- but from the center, from the moderate wing of the opposition party and its corporate sponsors. In a smokeless back room at the convention, a venerable, liberal senator, played by Jon Voight (who does this kind of thing so often you may think he's playing himself), is dumped from the ticket in favor of Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), a young New York congressman whose mother, Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), is a formidable power broker and a tireless promoter of her son's career. 
You may notice a slight resemblance to a certain real-life New York senator, but Ms. Streep's swaggering, ice-cube-chewing performance is too full of inspired, unpredictable mischief to be mere mimickry. 
Poor Raymond, a queasy-looking fellow who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in the gulf war, turns out to be at the center of a diabolical conspiracy involving military adventurism, maternal monstrousness and big business string-pulling. ''Manchurian'' no longer refers to a region in China, but rather to a multinational defense conglomerate whose mind-control techniques are much more high-tech then the Maoist-Freudian brainwashing methods that were popular back in 1962. (The queen of diamonds is redundant when you can implant subcutaneous chips, though the Oedipus complex does seem to have survived the collapse of Communism.) 
Are we meant to think of Halliburton? Maybe, but this film's political sensibility is less Kerry-Edwards than McCain-Feingold. The shadowy desire for total political control that scared us in the cold war -- the threat of ''powers that will make martial law look like anarchy,'' as Angela Lansbury so memorably put it in the earlier film -- seems impossibly quaint next to the mundane, insatiable drive to wring profit out of the world's instability. 
The conspiracy -- which the chip implanted in my own skin prevents me from discussing further -- seems at once overreaching and curiously undermotivated. Its details and parameters are also not fully explained, which makes the tangle of plot twists at the end feel a little dishonest. But the story, as in ''Silence of the Lambs,'' is designed mainly to keep you alert and on edge so that you can appreciate Mr. Demme's eye for detail and his cast's witty bravado. 
Kimberly Elise slyly revises a part originated by Janet Leigh, and Jeffrey Wright and Bruno Ganz are memorably strange in small roles. Mr. Schreiber looks a lot like Laurence Harvey, the first Raymond Shaw, which may have prevented him from reinventing his character as thoroughly as he might have. 
Like Frankenheimer (and also like Brian DePalma in ''Blow-Out'') Mr. Demme grasps the aesthetic potential of political suspicion. A crucial symptom of clinical paranoia, after all, is the conviction that what seems to be offhand, incidental or meaningless is actually freighted with significance. It is a disorder well suited to movie watching (to say nothing of moviemaking), and Mr. Demme caters to it by filling his busy, hectic frames with tantalizing visual and aural clues that give the movie texture and momentum. 
Our guide through this maze is Mr. Washington, who plays Major Marco with the perfect blend of stoicism and agitation. Marco, who was Raymond's commanding officer in Kuwait, is plagued by strange dreams, and by the growing suspicion that what he remembers of the gulf war is not what really happened. His search for the truth and his struggle to stay sane are fundamentally at cross purposes, since the closer he comes to an accurate version of events the crazier he seems, to himself and everyone else. 
He must contend simultaneously with external events and internal demons, and this two-front battle plays out on Mr. Washington's downcast, noble features. He gives the film's extravagant public scandal a dimension of private sadness. 
Whether it will have any political resonance remains to be seen. The uncanny implications of Frankenheimer's ''Candidate'' after all came into focus long after its initial release, when it re-emerged as a curious period artifact in the waning years of the cold war. Mr. Demme's version, in bright color rather than smoky black and white, is more transparent and less enigmatic. Though its intricate plot is full of surprises, this kind of story no longer has much power to shock. Maybe we've grown used to paranoia as the only sane response to a world beyond our comprehension or control. Or maybe we've been brainwashed. 
''The Manchurian Candidate'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some intense violence, and a lot of the kind of language politicians use when they think the public isn't listening.

‽
‽Intimate Strangers‽,‽In Patrice Leconte's sardonic psychological thriller, ''Intimate Strangers,'' Sandrine Bonnaire portrays a Gallic answer to one of Alfred Hitchcock's sleek blond women of mystery. Imagine the Grace Kelly of ''Rear Window'' or the Kim Novak of ''Vertigo'' sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. 
''Intimate Strangers,'' directed by Mr. Leconte from a screenplay by Jérôme Tonnerre, establishes its mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. 
The film's running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink, William Faber (Fabrice Luchini), is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant whose good friend and recent romantic partner, Jeanne (Anne Brochet), has left him for a gym rat (Laurent Gamelon). Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character, Anna, has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, on the same dark floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult, Dr. Monnier (Michel Duchaussoy), practices a few doors away. 
Before William has a chance to correct Anna's mistake, she begins pouring out the story of her dysfunctional marriage, and he finds himself too intrigued to come clean. As he points out later, a tax accountant's relationship to a client parallels a psychotherapist's. Both professions involve knowing personal secrets and making decisions about what to reveal and what to hide. 
''Intimate Strangers'' takes place less in the real world than in the realm of voyeuristic fantasy -- in other words, in the realm of film itself, which allows us to ogle beautiful people under the cover of darkness. And Ms. Bonnaire is something to ogle. The film, which opens today in New York, presents longing as a kind of romantic science fiction in which the what-if? is risk free, and it is more delicious to imagine a transcendent passion than to engage in the messy, potentially disappointing mechanics of actual consummation. 
Another variation on the same idea drives the recent and wonderful Italian film ''Facing Windows,'' in which attractive neighbors who have surreptitiously observed and desired each other finally connect and face reality. Both films involve a lot of staring out of windows and gazing at reflections. 
''Intimate Strangers'' is also a riff on the Henry James novella ''The Beast in the Jungle,'' whose protagonist spends his life frozen in the expectation of a remarkable destiny that never materializes. Midway in Anna's therapy, William, whose inability to respond to her subtle romantic signals recalls the paralysis of James's protagonist, lends her the novella. On returning it, she complains about its sad ending. 
A dumpy, slightly effeminate middle-aged man with scared saucer eyes, Mr. Luchini's William (who secretly dances around his apartment to Wilson Pickett's ''In the Midnight Hour'') is another of the movie's jokes. It's difficult to explain Anna's discreet romantic interest in him except as a comic illustration of the notion that opposites attract. 
''Intimate Strangers'' has great fun puncturing the mystique of psychoanalysis. When William calls on Dr. Monnier to seek Anna's telephone number, the doctor withholds it but charges William for a session. Monnier, who has more than a passing resemblance to Freud, is as greedy as he is grandiose. He offers William free advice over lunch, then makes him pick up the tab. While they dine, he offers his own pompous (nonsensical) variation on Freud's question ''What do women want?'' (''Once ajar, the door to female mystery is hard to shut again'') and plants the notion in William's head that Anna's abusive husband may be imaginary. William, with his shyness and a sense of propriety that camouflage a burning curiosity, proves a much better therapist than his professionally accredited neighbor. 
Other characters who dart in and out of the movie include Williams's nosy, disapproving secretary, Mrs. Mulon (Hélène Surgère); Anna's wildly jealous husband, Marc (Gilbert Melki), who is aroused by the fantasy of his wife sleeping with William; and Chatel (Urbain Cancelier), a client of Monnier's whose elevator phobia Anna endeavors to cure after encountering him on the way to a session. 
In the spirit of the best Hitchcock, ''Intimate Strangers'' is seriously light. Or is it lightly serious? 
''Intimate Strangers'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for its frank sexual talk.

‽
‽The Village‽,‽The ubiquitous advertisements for ''The Village,'' which opens today nationwide, promise that ''nothing can prepare you.'' Nothing, that is, except M. Night Shyamalan's last three movies and a passing acquaintance with ''The Twilight Zone.'' It is hard to think of another filmmaker so utterly committed to the predictable manufacture of narrative surprise. His supernatural conceits may vary from picture to picture -- ghosts in ''The Sixth Sense,'' comic-book superheroics in ''Unbreakable,'' space aliens and crop circles in ''Signs'' -- but his stories are always built around a carefully disguised, meticulously prepared twist. 
You can pass a pleasant few minutes outside the theater talking it over with your friends, but the conversations, like the movies that inspire them, tend to sound the same. For every innocent who professes amazement, there will be a wiseguy who says he saw it coming all along and an earnest analyst who picks the whole thing apart, looking for clues, foreshadowings and logical inconsistencies. 
The last thing I want to do is spoil the fun, meager though it is. I will say, though, that while I am generally pretty obtuse about these matters, I had an inkling early on of where ''The Village'' was going, which I then dismissed as too ridiculous to consider. When I turned out to be right I felt less vindicated than cheated. The film's ridiculousness would not be so irksome if Mr. Shyamalan did not take his sleight of hand so seriously, if he did not insist on dressing this scary, silly, moderately clever fairy tale in a somber cloak of allegory. 
I suppose it is to his credit that he wants the audience to think -- about fear, security and the fine line between rationality and superstition -- as well as tremble, but his ideas are as sloppy and obvious as his direction is elegant and restrained. He turns an artful gothic tale into a homework assignment. 
His impressive cast, meanwhile, bustles around as if ''The Village'' were the school play -- ''Our Town,'' maybe, or ''The Lottery.'' Their village, which appears not to have a name, is somewhere in the preindustrial wilds of Pennsylvania. It is cut off from the rest of the world (referred to as ''the towns'') by forests inhabited by monstrous, mysterious creatures. 
An elaborate set of rules and customs has been devised to keep the beasts at bay: there are watchtowers, warning bells and amber flags and robes, and anything red (''the bad color'') must be buried. (These colors may, in the film's allegorical scheme, be intended to evoke the government's color-coded terror alerts.) Domestic animals are sometimes found killed and partly skinned, and now and again the monsters emerge from the shadows to frighten and warn the villagers. They are propitiated with fresh meat and earnest meetings of the village elders, a distinguished group that includes William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson and Cherry Jones. 
Otherwise, life goes on in its normal, old-fashioned storybook way. There are barn dances, weddings and big outdoor meals at tables laden with lovely victuals, all of it filmed in grayish reproduction-antique light by the incomparable Roger Deakins. People speak in a stately, wordy idiom, disdaining contractions and using the subjunctive with breathtaking precision. Mr. Hurt was born to talk this way -- he talks this way in all his movies -- which is no doubt why he was elected (or appointed, or whatever) village elder in chief (or school headmaster, or something). The younger folk have a tougher time of it, in particular Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Mr. Hurt's blind younger daughter, Ivy. 
Ms. Howard, making her movie debut, has enough charm to make her way through some of the script's sillier lines. ''Do you find me too much of a tomboy?'' she asks the moody Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). ''I do long to do boy things.'' As, no doubt, does he. So, for that matter, does the village idiot, Noah, played with good-natured hamminess by Adrien Brody. Indeed, the whole village seems to be possessed by barely suppressed yearnings and guilty secrets. These, more than the beasts in the woods, might have been the subject of an interesting, Hardyesque inquiry into small-town life, but Mr. Shyamalan once again uses the psychology of his characters as the ultimate red herring, fooling us into caring more about the people in the movie than he does. 
He does, at least, care about the way his movies look, and his disdain for newfangled special effects is refreshing. His mastery of classic suspense-movie framing and cutting is as impressive as ever, and the sound design, which layers James Newton Howard's spooky score with the equally sinister sounds of the forest, is impressive, especially when it evokes Ivy's blindness. At times you do sit up in your chair and crane your neck, as if you could see around the next bend of the story and glimpse what's coming. Then you do see it, and you burst out laughing. 
''The Village'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violent scenes and an atmosphere of pervasive menace.

‽
‽Garden State‽,‽''Garden State,'' Zach Braff's small, smart, off-kilter comedy, has the cheek to present itself as ''The Graduate 2004,'' although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as ''The Anti-Graduate 2004.'' From its story of the awakening of an emotionally numbed young man -- played by Mr. Braff, who wrote and directed the movie -- to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack that throws in vintage Simon and Garfunkel (''The Only Living Boy in New York''), ''Garden State'' obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. 
The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, Andrew Largeman, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because ''The Graduate'' established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through ''American Beauty'' and beyond, you expect ''Garden State'' to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. 
At one point ''Garden State'' drops a comic reference to Aldous Huxley's ''Brave New World'' in which the author's name is misidentified as Huxtable. Like many passing references in ''Garden State,'' this one is far from accidental. Just as the happy citizens of Huxley's dystopia were pacified by a drug called soma (a sort of idealized hybrid of Prozac and Ecstasy), Andrew has spent years cut off from his darker feelings with the aid of pharmaceuticals (including lithium) prescribed by his father, Gideon (Ian Holm), a pompous psychiatrist. 
What necessitates Andrew's return from the West Coast, where he works in a Vietnamese restaurant while struggling as an actor (he has had one prominent role in a made-for-TV movie), is his mother's death. Paraplegic from a freak accident for which Gideon tacitly blames his son, who was 9 at the time, his mother died at home in the bathtub. The father and son have never confronted the complicated layers of blame and guilt that have festered under Andrew's chemical insulation. 
Because Andrew has left his medications in Los Angeles, his buried emotions begin to stir. If you take ''Garden State'' as a generational statement, the plastics of ''The Graduate'' have been replaced by prescription drugs as the symbolic soul-destroying enemy. Recreational drugs are also questioned in a scene in which Andrew and a bunch of high school friends break through uncomfortable social barriers with the shortcuts of Ecstasy and pot. 
Without his medication Andrew experiences recurrent flash headaches. At his father's urging, he consults a neurologist (Ron Liebman), who finds nothing physically wrong but who gently advises him to switch psychiatrists. 
In the doctor's waiting room Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a charming, uninhibited motormouth and pathological liar who suffers from epilepsy. The friendship they strike up quickly blossoms into something more. Andrew, who found himself unable to cry at his mother's grave, squeezes his first real tear into a paper cup she holds under his left eye. 
As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, ''Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliché by turning it inside out is a worthy one. All the characters are aggressively quirky. Andrew's best friend from high school, Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), is a gravedigger and pothead who takes Andrew and Samantha to a quarry inhabited by a bohemian couple who live in a boat. Another high school friend, Albert (Denis O'Hare), who has made millions from patenting a no-noise version of Velcro, lives in a mansion devoid of furniture. 
There is no Mrs. Robinson to skewer as a predatory spiritual vacuum. The movie goes out of its way to appreciate two unusual moms: Mark's pot-smoking mother, Carol (Jean Smart), and Sam's ultra-homey mother, Olivia (Ann Dowd), who has taken an African student into their home. Ms. Portman's manic Sam and Mr. Braff's depressed Andrew make an appealing couple. 
As an actor, Mr. Braff (familiar from the television series ''Scrubs'') is a homely but handsome screen presence, like Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock. This movie's artfully lightheaded visual style combines the freneticism of vintage Richard Lester with the whimsy of Wes Anderson. When not whizzing to and fro, Lawrence Sher's cinematography occasionally pauses to frame an image with the same care for composition that Conrad L. Hall brought to ''American Beauty.'' 
But a scrupulous avoidance of any solemnity makes ''Garden State'' a bit too light for its own good. Its method of skipping from one incident to another feels scatterbrained, and promising characters are left behind in the rush. The forced feel-good ending seems tacked on, a thudding final sentence with too many exclamation points. 
''Garden State'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language.

‽
‽She Hate Me‽,‽In his angry new comedy, ''She Hate Me,'' Spike Lee carries his political exasperation beyond outrage into chaos. The carelessness with which he hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of last-ditch marketing: grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball, and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. 
This feisty New York filmmaker with a nose for tabloid news has always relished playing provocateur and setting brush fires with his rub-your-face-in-it style of riffing off the headlines. Usually his rampages leave behind at least some patches of scorched earth before burning out. 
''She Hate Me,'' which rattles on for nearly two and a half hours, is the first of his fiery diatribes that repeatedly fizzles as it goes along. 
Lashing out in all directions, Mr. Lee addresses white-collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. 
A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' harangue the next, ''She Hate Me'' can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh. The boilerplate polemics mouthed by stick-figure characters sound like the beery 3 a.m. debates of a college bull session that has outlasted its usefulness. 
The movie begins with a montage of crisp rippling currency that features the face of George W. Bush on a $3 bill. Then it introduces its semihero, Jack Armstrong (Anthony Mackie), a 30-year-old African-American smoothie and vice president of Progeia, a pharmaceutical giant desperate to be the first company to market an AIDS vaccine. 
When the Food and Drug Administration withholds its approval, Progeia's saintly chief researcher dives from an office window along with the company's stock. Reviewing the dead man's computer file, Jack learns of corporate dirty deeds, falsified data, shredded documents and stock manipulation. 
Confronting his bosses, he is told to keep his mouth shut but decides to turn whistle-blower. Summarily fired, his reputation smeared, his bank account frozen, he's suddenly a nobody, and the movie takes an awkward leap by comparing Jack's misfortune to the plight of Frank Wills, the security guard who reported the Watergate break-in and went on to die in poverty while the conspirators prospered. 
Enter Fatima (Kerry Washington), Jack's ex-fiancée, with whom he broke up after catching her in bed with a woman. Showing up with her girlfriend Alex (Dania Ramirez), Fatima offers him $10,000 to impregnate the two of them. Desperate for money, he reluctantly agrees. In short order, with Fatima acting as his agent, his apartment becomes a stud farm for lesbians willing to shell out $10,000 apiece for his seed. Infinitely potent and fertile, Jack takes on four or five women a night, eventually fathering 19 children for happy lesbian couples. His attitude toward his work is comically illustrated with animated sperms bearing his face wriggling toward grinning eggs. 
Long after ''She Hate Me'' has exhausted its material, it refuses to give up. In the last interminable third of the movie, Mr. Lee and his screenwriting collaborator, Michael Genet, throw in a lesbian Mafia princess, Simona (Monica Bellucci), whose father, Don Angelo Bonasera (John Turturro), does an extended, tedious parody of Marlon Brando in ''The Godfather.'' 
The point seems to be that the Mafia's notion of family is kinder and gentler than Progeia's inhuman family values propounded with Orwellian cynicism by its C.E.O., Leland Powell (Woody Harrelson), and his chief lieutenant, Margo Chadwick (Ellen Barkin in a Martha Stewart haircut). 
As usual in a Spike Lee film, the sexual politics are muddled. The director can't resist presenting Jack Armstrong as a yuppie version of the black sexual superman. Unveiling his manhood to a group of lesbians, who are the sort of gorgeous, slithery babes seen writhing in rap videos, his show is greeted with oohs and ahs of lustful appreciation. 
The movie eventually does a turnabout by giving him pangs of conscience brought on by the disapproval of his morally upstanding family. Jack, we're informed, is not to be confused with the negative stereotype of an African-American man who impregnates women and then disappears. In his heart and soul he, too, is a family man. 
Throughout ''She Hate Me'' you can sense Mr. Lee trying to do the right thing. But in spite of itself, the movie supports the adolescent caveman fantasy that a lesbian is really a heterosexual woman who hasn't received proper stud service. 
''She Hate Me'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes, simulated sex, nudity, and profanity.

‽The Bourne Supremacy‽,‽It may sound odd to call a chilly, paranoid thriller like ''The Bourne Supremacy'' entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11, this globe-trotting post-cold-war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal served while riding the world's smoothest roller coaster. 
As the story unfolds at a whirring pace whose tremors flow like the seamless pulses in a sleek, percussive symphony, watching the movie feels like lying back after the meat loaf and mashed potatoes and being spoon-fed gourmet ice cream while the wind whistles in your ears. 
There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies and moles from Russia and the United States tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. Nor are there flashy computerized embellishments or martial arts stunts. This is high-speed action realism carried off with the dexterity of a magician pulling a hundred rabbits out of a hat in one graceful gesture. The crowning flourish is an extended car chase through the streets and tunnels of Moscow that ranks as one of the three or four most exciting demolition derbies ever filmed. 
In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned. Doug Liman, the original director, is now an executive producer, and Paul Greengrass (who oversaw the docudrama ''Bloody Sunday'') has taken over as director. The screenwriter Tony Gilroy is back, as are the cinematographer Oliver Wood and the composer John Powell. 
Crouched in the eye of the storm once again is Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, Jason spends almost the entire movie, which opens today nationwide, on the run. 
The character, created by the novelist Robert Ludlum, is so resourceful that he might be described as Superman With Partial Amnesia. One of his favorite tricks is to call the people he's spying on and describe what he is observing through his telescopic lens. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. 
Other returning cast members include Franka Potente as Jason's sweetheart, Marie (her appearance is brief), and Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Gabriel Mann as C.I.A. agents of varying rank. ''The Bourne Supremacy,'' like its predecessor, is not C.I.A.-friendly. In the light of recent headlines, that skepticism lends it an extra frisson of credibility. 
In a movie in which most of the dialogue consists of curt exclamations, Jason may amount to little more than an embattled cipher. But Mr. Damon, who has shed much of his boyish ingenuousness (he is beginning to suggest the grown-up Robert Wagner), plays him as a cunning escape artist and technophile, with lightning reflexes as well as a streak of sadness. 
The actor's masklike features suit his chameleonic character, but in the rare moments that his face softens, there is the suggestion that he will be the loneliest man in the world the moment that he stops running. The trickle of emotion leaking through his pressurized stress lends the movie an emotional undertone subtly accented by the weary sighs in Mr. Powell's otherwise propulsive score. 
The story begins in Goa, India, where Jason and Marie hide until the arrival of a killer (Karl Urban), dispatched by a Russian oil mogul (Karel Roden), abruptly ends their idyll. At the same time, the C.I.A. is investigating the murder of two agents in Berlin, where a glaring fingerprint left at the scene of the crime points to Jason. 
This time, a C.I.A. deputy, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), pressures her boss, Ward Abbott (Mr. Cox), to reopen a case that was closed two years earlier and bring Jason down. In short order, a C.I.A. team led by Ms. Allen descends on Berlin. As usual, this actress is just about perfect: crisp but not frozen. Meanwhile, Jason's flight takes him from Goa to Naples to Berlin to Moscow as he eludes and battles one assassin after another. 
As an action-movie travelogue, ''The Bourne Supremacy'' is unusually evocative. From its beaches of Goa to Berlin's clotted skyline to Moscow in the snow, its city lights glowing, it imparts a glamorized sense of tourism under duress. 
Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a movie that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride in which every curve and dip is calculated. Where most Hollywood action movies, edited within an inch of their lives, use split-second leaps and flashes as visual jolts to camouflage holes, ''The Bourne Supremacy'' knows what it's doing. Its relentless speed not only puts you in Jason's shoes by suggesting the adrenaline rush of a fugitive who has no time to look around, but also suggests Jason's quick thinking. If you pay close attention, you won't get lost. And even if you do, it doesn't take away from the fun. 
''The Bourne Supremacy'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for scenes of violence.

‽
‽What Is It?‽,‽For more than 20 years, Crispin Glover, actor, has maintained a truly distinctive, oddball persona, existing on his own plane. Unsurprisingly, his directorial debut, "What Is It?" — which plays as part of a double bill with a live, enthusiastically performed slide show in which Mr. Glover displays pages from his recent series of books — is just as unclassifiable as he is. (The film and slide show play tonight through Sunday night at the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village.) 
Unsettling and often quite absurd, his labor of love, almost 10 years in the making, is predominantly inhabited by people with Down syndrome, whose dialogue is often indecipherable. There is also a person with cerebral palsy; three naked women with monkey faces (played by pornographic-film stars); a menacing Shirley Temple doll; Mr. Glover himself, as the apparent ruler of an underworld freak show; numerous  snails; and a man in blackface who injects the snails' slime in hopes of becoming one. What is it indeed. 
There's no point in mentioning plot, as there doesn't seem to be one. Very little connects the characters, some of whom may double as one another's psyches, and their actions, which range from sexually graphic to just plain repellent. (Snails, and people, are killed regularly.) 
Some will deem Mr. Glover a brave visionary unafraid to deliver a kick in the teeth to Hollywood or to address society's discomfort with the handicapped. Others will find him to be a reckless exploiter intent solely on making audiences squirm. Either way, Crispin Hellion Glover, auteur, is a force to be reckoned with. (Two more installments are to follow.) 
WHAT IS IT? 
Opens today in Manhattan.  
Written, directed and edited by Crispin Hellion Glover; director of photography, Wyatt Troll; art director, Floyd Albee; produced by Mr. Glover, Matt Devlen and Ryan Page.

‽
‽See No Evil‽,‽Whether pursuing acting careers or state governorships, professional wrestlers generally fare better with a minimum of dialogue. The makers of "See No Evil" understand this, allotting their star, Kane (a k a Glen Jacobs), a mere handful of syllables to play Jacob Goodnight, a lumbering psychopath holed up in the penthouse of a derelict hotel. 
Resembling nothing so much as a better-exfoliated version of the Thing, Jacob works out his mommy issues by murdering the hapless homeless who wander into his territory. Armed with a meat cleaver and a manicure Barbra Streisand would envy, he excavates their eyeballs and pops them into pickling jars. Yummy. 
When a busload of delinquents from the local detention center arrives at the hotel for cleanup duty, "See No Evil" devolves into an increasingly bloody and creative string of butcherings and impalings. The director, Gregory Dark, and the writer, Dan Madigan, ensure no sympathy for the foulmouthed victims, who spend most of their premutilation time drinking, toking and showering as if auditioning for the Spice Channel. 
Shooting everything with an inebriated camera that bounces off walls, crawls over cockroaches and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the appropriately named Mr. Dark has no use for actors as anything other than body-bag fillers. He does, however, provide us with one of the most inventive cinematic examples of death by cellphone. Parents, please don't try this at home. 
"See No Evil" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for soft-core sex and drugs, hard-core language and violence, and simply dreadful family values.

‽
‽Grizzly Man‽,‽One rainy afternoon in the Alaskan wilderness two years ago, a self-made man named Timothy Treadwell was  mauled and eaten by a grizzly bear. It may be that the animal, a scrawny male about 28 years old and 1,000 pounds, was trying to fatten up in preparation for its winter's sleep. As it happens, Treadwell, who achieved minor celebrity as an expert on grizzlies, publishing a book on the bears and jousting with David Letterman on late-night television, had pitched his tent in a feeding ground. The call of the wild was as irresistible to Treadwell as his flesh proved to be to that bear. 
The strange story of Timothy Treadwell, a Long Island native who came to see himself as some kind of ursine Dr. Dolittle, only to die at 46 from a bear attack,  is the subject of "Grizzly Man," the latest documentary from Werner Herzog. As fans of the German New Wave know, the director has a fondness for stories about men who journey into the heart of darkness, both without and within - men like the deranged 16th-century explorer in "Aguirre, the Wrath of God," who searches for El Dorado in the Amazon, and the early-20th-century esthete in "Fitzcarraldo" who hauls a steamboat up a mountain  to bring Caruso to the Peruvian jungle. Treadwell's journey was no less bold or reckless than these earlier Herzogian tales and certainly no less enthralling. 
Mr. Herzog has been making documentaries for more than three decades, about as long as he has been directing fiction films, but he is not part of any nonfiction tradition. In a statement on his Web site, wernerherzog.com, he declares: "By dint of declaration the so-called cinéma vérité is devoid of vérité. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants." This is a rather crude  attempt to separate himself from the nonfiction crowd, but Mr. Herzog is also no ordinary filmmaker. It is the rare documentary like "Grizzly Man," which has  beauty and passion often lacking in any type of film, that makes you want to grab its maker and head off to the nearest bar to discuss man's domination of nature and how Disney's cute critters reflect our profound alienation from the natural order. 
Beauty enters first in "Grizzly Man," which opens with two bears  grazing on a spectacular stretch of green in the Katmai National Park and Preserve, a nearly five-million-acre swath on the Alaska Peninsula. Dressed in black, his  pageboy stirring in the wind, Treadwell walks into the frame and introduces the grizzlies as Ed and Rowdy. "They're challenging everything, including me," he says as the bears munch away. "If I show weakness, if I retreat, I may be hurt, I may be killed. I must hold my own if I am going to stay within this land. For once there is weakness, they will exploit it, they will take me out, they will decapitate me, they will chop me into bits and pieces. I'm dead. But so far, I persevere,  persevere." 
It is a typical Treadwell recitation - sincere, grandiose and intensely worrisome - a bit of bravura that ends with the self-designated "kind warrior" blowing a kiss and signing off like Kojak: "Love you, Rowdy." Even if you don't know that Treadwell was killed along with his girlfriend, a physician's assistant named Amie Huguenard, his familiarity with, and proximity to, the bears bodes badly, for him and for them. There is something surreal (at least to a committed urbanite) about anyone who would talk to these animals, especially a guy whose blond, bland good looks made him seem like an aging surfer, a kind of Spicoli of the backwoods. But as Mr. Herzog points out in his online manifesto, "facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable." 
Despite some early bumps, Treadwell started off as an average sort.  After an injury put an end to an athletic scholarship, he moved to (where else?) Southern California. There he did the usual bumming around, but his life  soured and, according to his book, "Among Grizzlies," written with Jewel Palovak, he suffered a near-fatal drug overdose. Scared straight, he gradually reinvented himself, and by the early 1990's was summering in Katmai, home to about  2,000 grizzlies. Mr. Herzog lays out this history in voice-over, illustrating Treadwell's ups and downs through the spectacular videos the amateur naturalist shot and interviews with the dead man's family and friends. The filmmaker also taps the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on Treadwell and Huguenard, Dr. Franc G. Fallico, a character around whom an entire reality show could be built. 
Dr. Fallico pops up a couple of times in "Grizzly Man," but the most potent use of his testimony occurs when he expounds  at length in an autopsy room, a scene that illustrates Mr. Herzog's sense of drama beautifully. Sporting a blue smock and a fixed gaze, Dr. Fallico recounts his version of the attack, a  description based on his examination of the bodies and the six-minute audio record found on one of Treadwell's video cameras. (The lens cap was on the camera.) The account is graphic, gruesome and thoroughly riveting, partly because morbid tales always tug at the imagination, but also because Dr. Fallico turns out to be an incredible storyteller. For Mr. Herzog, it's clear that the truth of this story isn't located just in the facts that the doctor strings together with florid gestures and pregnant pauses, but in a performance that is as artful as it is true. 
Treadwell's adventures among his beloved grizzlies were also a kind of performance, built on lies and truth and played out on the stage of celebrity. Even though his choices were dangerous and finally fatal, he traveled a familiar American path shaped by boundless optimism and an almost religious belief in the self. He lived among grizzlies because he believed that he could. Given this, the cheap shots that followed his death, including the appalling snarkiness that crept  into newspaper headlines ("Grizzly bear that killed pair attacked at lunchtime"), are revelatory. For some, Treadwell's death confirmed that animal activists and environmentalists are dangerous wackos; for others, though, his unhappy end may have suggested something equally disturbing: sometimes a smile and  American goodwill aren't enough. 
Throughout "Grizzly Man," men and women pay testament to Treadwell's niceness and naïveté. Some are kind; others less so. Each testifier seems to capture some authentic quality of Treadwell, who from the evidence of his videos and Mr. Herzog's sympathetic inquiry, seemed equally nice and naïve, brave and foolish. At some point that foolishness mushroomed into a welter of delusions about his power to survive the wilderness in which he so recklessly tried to find himself. His death, as inevitable as it was preventable, could mean that he may have been more lost than found. Mr. Herzog remains generous to a fault on this particular point, perhaps because he recognizes that for someone like Treadwell, there is nothing more terrifying than being ordinary, even the claws of a grizzly. 
"Grizzly Man" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some adult language and vivid descriptions of a bear mauling.

‽
‽Stealth‽,‽The sight of Jessica Biel wiggling her shapely rear through the North Korean backcountry in the action flick "Stealth" isn't the most ludicrous image of our current movie season, but it comes close. As it happens, the most preposterous moment in this preposterous crypto-video game occurs after Ms. Biel's character, a United States naval pilot, parachutes from her stealth aircraft through a hailstorm of fiery debris, races across North Korea while chased by thugs with guns, and rushes into the arms of the man who risks worldwide nuclear holocaust to rescue her. Thanks, dude! 
A hash of "Top Gun" and "Behind Enemy Lines," among myriad other influences, and topped with a soupçon of "2001," this story of three comrades up against a villainous miscellany has the makings of a kitsch classic. Any film that places romance above Armageddon and forces a fine actor like Josh Lucas to parade around in a swimsuit like a model for International Male would certainly seem to have the appropriate wrong stuff. Too bad that the screenwriter W. D. Richter and the director Rob Cohen, who has almost extinguished all the good will he built up from "The Fast and the Furious," don't seem in on the joke. Nor do members of  the cast, which includes Jamie Foxx and Sam Shepard, crack many smiles, despite the inherent hilarity of the material. 
Set in the very near future during, as an opening scroll explains, the "mounting threat of terrorism," the story hinges on three stealth pilots - Ms. Biel's Kara, Mr. Lucas's Ben and Mr. Foxx's improbably named Henry Purcell - who zip around the globe putting out fires, fanning flames and swapping chummy barbs with Mr. Shepard's commanding officer. The pilots get along splendidly, but bashful Kara and flirty Ben look as if they would like to do more than pal around. Hence Mr. Lucas and Ms. Biel's swimsuit duet during a pointless sojourn in Thailand, an exotic backdrop for the usual military R&amp;R (beautiful locals with negligible English skills, etc.) and the only foreign country that these happy three visit and don't shoot up. 
One of the pleasures of entertainments like the Bond films is that they work as a sort of travelogue, taking us places we've never been  (or at least to convincing facsimiles) and opening us to the world. Not so "Stealth," which, other than that Thailand layover, inspires no such wanderlust. The reason isn't that the film was mostly shot in Australia, which almost always looks inviting; rather, it's that almost every locale gets blown to bits almost as soon as the pilots come within shooting distance. Among the less fortunate territories: Myanmar, Tajikistan, North Korea and a corner of Alaska, all of which come under intense fire. 
It's no wonder that in "Stealth" the planet usually looks better from 35,000 feet above ground, a vantage point that makes everything - including people, who alternately look like ants and characters in a video game - seem awfully distant and terribly unreal. 
What's interesting about "Stealth" isn't its nitwit story, which largely involves a next-generation aircraft operated by a computer with a voice meant to evoke HAL 9000 that sounds more like an interminably snotty hotel clerk right before a phone bounces off his head. No, what's interesting about this movie - and many others of its kind - is that it continues the love affair Hollywood, that hotbed of liberalism, has long had with militarism. As is almost always the case in these movies, the fall guy here turns out to be a rogue bad apple who, though abetted by black-bag types and a shadowy politician, is lodged in an otherwise unsullied bushel of warriors. Like Kara, these boys fret about collateral damage, but are more obsessed with big bangs than little people. 
 
"Stealth" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lot of explosions, a number of bloodless deaths and some adult language.

‽
‽Bewitched‽,‽Once upon a television time, when witches, genies and homemaker vampires ruled the roost, the war of the sexes was as cute as the button nose on Elizabeth Montgomery's face. As the star of the dimwitted delight "Bewitched," Ms. Montgomery wiggled her protuberance at a husband whose bumbling ways turned a topical power struggle into the stuff of canned laughter. 
For some, 1964 is fondly remembered as the year President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a civil rights act, barring sex discrimination in the workplace, as well as the year Ms. Montgomery materialized as the gauzily sexy witch Samantha. 
"Bewitched" is now a big-screen movie with Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell and a nicely tuned supporting cast. Because the ethereally beautiful Ms. Kidman no longer resembles a real person, having been buffed to almost supernatural perfection in the way of most modern stars, casting her as a witch was inspired. 
Equally clever is the film's core conceit, which finds her playing Isabel Bigelow, a reluctant witch who is  cast as Samantha in a remake of the original sitcom. Anxious to leave behind the world of spells and (especially, it seems) warlocks, Isabel yearns for the simple life, much as Eddie Albert did when he moved next door to a pig on "Green Acres." Instead, the witch becomes a star. 
This multisituational silliness is agreeably watchable for an hour. Isabel, having made a vow to go on the witchcraft wagon, settles into a dream of a house complete with a white picket fence, a garlanded lawn and a tortoise-shell cat. Much like other cultural aliens, both extraterrestrial and those fresh off the boat, sweet Isabel is charmingly overwhelmed by her new world. 
She relishes the idea of shopping like a mere mortal but doesn't give any thought to how to pay for her groceries. And when she tries to hook up the cable, she (understandably) turns on the charms. It's no wonder that her father, Nigel (Michael Caine), casts a skeptical eye at his daughter; he seems to know that relinquishing your power is no easy thing. 
These early scenes unfold smoothly, and it appears that the director, Nora Ephron, who wrote the screenplay with her sister, Delia Ephron, gave some thought to what it might be like to be a witch who suddenly has to live in the human world. 
It's pleasant just to watch Ms. Kidman float through the movie's sets like a visitor from another land; she's as adorable as E.T., though her voice is as baby-breathy as that of Marilyn Monroe. Ms. Kidman has of late become perhaps overly fond of speaking in such undertones (it makes you wonder if she permanently strained her vocal cords), but here the kittenish delivery adds a crucial softness, a sense of comfort, that doesn't come naturally to this actress. 
During the first years of "Bewitched," Ms. Montgomery was one of the era's stealth vixens, a woman whose alert eyes darted under the cover of unthreatening blondeness. Unlike Lucy Ricardo, from whose canyon mouth flowed a river of complaint (and whose restlessness always felt somehow tragic), Samantha really did seem like the girl next door who was happy to become the model wife. 
The great joke of "Bewitched" was that unlike Lucy, Samantha had enormous power but kept it in check to placate her husband, unless it served her purposes. It's a sign of the times - and perhaps of the fact that women wrote, directed and produced this film - that Samantha's surrendering her power in a marriage no longer seems as believable as her becoming a celebrity. 
The story, such as it is, kicks in when the movie star Jack Wyatt (a relatively unplugged Will Ferrell) tries to kick-start a faltering career by starring in a television redo of "Bewitched." Because he's playing Darrin, the witch's genially hapless husband, Jack angles for an unknown as Samantha, the better to hog all the limelight. 
He ends up with Ms. Kidman's Isabel ostensibly because not a single woman in Los Angeles's vast reservoir of acting talent can wiggle her nose like Elizabeth Montgomery. Yet Isabel is also cute, easily improvises with Jack about witch dos and don'ts (you need a permit for a poisoned apple and so forth) and looks mighty fine on camera, which temporarily works against her when she tests better than Jack with the audience. 
Ms. Kidman and Mr. Ferrell are not an intuitive match, and the romantic side of the story is both half-hearted and half-baked. But this self-contained actress has rarely come across as relaxed in the company of another performer. 
For his part, Mr. Ferrell enjoys a few ticklishly funny moments with Ms. Kidman and Jason Schwartzman, playing his sycophant manager. And the sight (and sounds) of his biking onto the set while loudly singing his own name has comic tang, as does a more developed scene in which Jack pretends he's insufferably pampered. Mr. Ferrell looks more streamlined than he has in the past, perhaps in concession to the story's low-wattage romance, but Nora Ephron's attempts to turn him into Tom Hanks Lite are unfortunate. 
Best known for screenplays like "When Harry Met Sally" and for bowdlerizing Lubitsch's "Shop Around the Corner" with her execrable "You've Got Mail," Ms. Ephron is one of those directors whose work is only as good as her cast and crew. Outside of the performers there isn't much to look at here, but given the cavalcade of supporting characters there are some distractions, including Shirley MacLaine, Heather Burns and Stephen Colbert. Along with the two stars, they keep the film in gear until it hits the hour mark, whereupon it dies. (Steve Carell, doing Paul Lynde doing Uncle Arthur, provides some late relief.) 
The film's screenwriters conjured up a very clever gimmick when they decided to revamp a favorite 60's television show. Too bad they forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. 
"Bewitched" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film is pretty tame, though as is his onscreen wont, Mr. Ferrell does go partly bare for one scene.

‽
‽Melinda and Melinda‽,‽The new Woody Allen movie, "Melinda and Melinda," is framed, somewhat in the manner of "Broadway Danny Rose," by table talk. Lingering over dinner at Pastis, four marvelously articulate New Yorkers debate the interpretation of an anecdote, unheard by the audience, involving an unhappy young woman named Melinda. 
Two of the diners happen to be playwrights - perhaps the only two left in New York who could afford to eat at such a restaurant, but never mind - and one of them, a maker of serious dramas (Larry Pine) sees the story as a tragedy, while the other, a cherubic author of comedies (Wallace Shawn), claims it for his own preferred genre. 
That the tragedian turns out to have a sunnier view of life than his colleague is part of the film's point: in life and in art, funny often keeps close company with sad, to the extent that it is sometimes hard to distinguish one from the other. Mr. Allen does not make it much easier. 
As he interweaves two versions of the Melinda story, one meant to be bathed in pathos, the other sprinkled with whimsy, it becomes apparent that his notions of comedy and tragedy do not quite correspond either to scholarly dogma or to everyday usage. You might, for instance, expect the tragic tale to purge your unruly emotions through pity and terror, rather than through bafflement and ennui. You might also expect the comic half of the movie to be funny, in which case the joke is on you. 
The link between the two asymmetrical stories is Radha Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both, surrounded in each case by a different supporting cast. The distinction between comedy and tragedy comes down, ultimately, to her: if she is wild-haired, fretfully smoking and overacting like a contestant in the Jennifer Jason Leigh category on "American Idol," then it must be tragedy. If, on the other hand, her hair is neatly bobbed and her manner ingenue-fresh, then comedy is the name of the game. 
In both renderings, she crashes a dinner party with an air of distress and a tale of woe, and her arrival sets off a chain of marital misunderstanding and emotional collision that swirls through subsequent parties and further dinners in charming Manhattan restaurants. 
The tragic Melinda barges in on some old friends - Laurel (Chloë Sevigny), a Park Avenue trust-fund baby, and her husband, Lee (Jonny Lee Miller), an intermittently employed actor with a bit of a drinking problem. This Melinda arrives demanding single malt Scotch and brandishing a florid life story that includes a bitter divorce, an unhappy love affair and a suicide attempt. (An even darker chapter is revealed later on.) 
Her comic counterpart, whose misery is less Gothic, lives downstairs from another couple, an intermittently employed actor named Hobie (Will Ferrell) and his wife, Susan (Amanda Peet), an independent filmmaker. In both scenarios, Melinda's presence stirs up latent instabilities within her friends' marriages and causes some upheaval in their social and professional lives. 
Not that the two plots are exactly parallel, though they are connected by ingeniously placed details and motifs. In the comedy, Hobie falls in love with Melinda, while in the tragedy she and Laurel become rivals for the affections of a gallant pianist and composer with the extraordinary name of Ellis Moonsong, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Love, Actually," "Dirty Pretty Things"). 
Mr. Ejiofor's presence, along with that of Daniel Sunjata in a smaller, similar role in the film's comic half, is perhaps the biggest shock in "Melinda and Melinda." In the fifth decade of his career as a New York filmmaker, Mr. Allen has written not one but two black characters into a movie, without sensationalism or stereotyping. Better late than never, I suppose. 
In every other respect, though, Mr. Allen's Manhattan remains a fantasy world, which is both a serious limitation and a minor source of delight. By now, there is nothing to be gained from complaining about the inaccuracies and anachronisms that color his view of the city or the strange, stilted idioms its inhabitants use in his films. It is better to appreciate him as a kind of preservationist, carefully restoring a cultural niche where the hectic elegance of old studio comedies and serious Broadway plays might still flourish amid the vulgar madcap of the 21st-century metropolis. 
"Melinda and Melinda" is perhaps best thought of as an offering to the memories of Ernst Lubitsch and George S. Kaufman, half-forgotten culture heroes whose examples of crisp sophistication deserve to be kept alive for future generations. 
Mr. Allen pries his actors away from their naturalistic habits, evoking a pre-Method style of performance that has all but vanished from the modern stage and screen. The results are mixed. Ms. Sevigny, Mr. Ejiofor and Ms. Peet seem liberated, freed of the necessity to plumb psychological depths and able to explore behavior rather than motive. Mr. Miller, struggling with an underwritten part and a badly fitting accent, has a harder time, as does Mr. Ferrell, who is miscast in the Woody Allen surrogate role of soulful schlemiel. 
Mr. Ferrell, with his large, shambling body and bland features, is hardly the ideal mouthpiece for the jittery, hostile one-liners that afflict Mr. Allen's writing like a tic. Coming into a pretentiously decorated vacation house in the Hamptons, Mr. Ferrell seems much more likely to trip over the furniture than to insult it, and Mr. Allen grudgingly allows him a single moment of physical comedy, involving a bathrobe that gets stuck in a door. 
Which brings me to the real reason to appreciate Mr. Allen, which is as an unrivaled pornographer. I'm not talking about sex; there is some bed-hopping in "Melinda and Melinda," but the camera always stops at the bedroom door. These days, in any case, the kind of New Yorkers likely to see a Woody Allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate, and the long hallways, high ceilings and open kitchens on display in this movie are likely to keep local audiences sighing and moaning for the full 99 minutes. 
To make the fantasy even more delicious and indecent, these apartments are inhabited by struggling actors, filmmakers and musicians who amusingly complain about being broke when the combined market value of their property could finance another installation of "The Gates." Which is, come to think of it, both funny and sad. 
"Melinda and Melinda" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many sexual references and situations, and some off-color language.

‽
‽Are We There Yet?‽,‽Since he burst "Straight Outta Compton" on the record of that name in 1988, Ice Cube (born O'Shea Jackson) has gone through multiple incarnations as an entertainer, from the controversial front man for the rap group N.W.A. to film roles as the self-destructive gang member in "Boyz N the Hood" and the genial stoner in "Friday" and its sequels (of which he is also co-writer and co-producer). In the "Barbershop" films of recent years, Ice Cube began to reinvent his on-screen persona as a warmhearted family man. In the new comedy "Are We There Yet?," he takes that persona from PG-13 to PG territory, focusing on a new demographic of preteenage fans. 
Ice Cube plays Nick Persons, the easygoing owner of a sports memorabilia shop in Portland, Ore. Nick is a bachelor and confirmed ladies' man who hates children the way Ebenezer Scrooge hates Christmas: as a matter of principle. But when he casts his eye on a luscious divorced woman named Suzanne (Nia Long), he is forced to reconsider his antichild policy. 
Unfortunately for Nick, Suzanne's two children, 11-year-old Lindsey and 8-year-old Kevin (Aleisha Allen and Philip Daniel Bolden), have vowed to sabotage their mother's suitors by any means necessary, including booby-trapping the front doorstep with a carpet of slippery marbles. So Nick courts Suzanne while steering clear of the two terrors until, stuck in Vancouver on a business trip, Suzanne asks him to take the youngsters up for a visit. 
Their journey is predictably star-crossed: luggage is lost, planes missed and cars wrecked and abandoned, until finally Nick is chasing the children on horseback as they stow away on a boxcar. The inexorable logic of breakdown and disintegration in "Are We There Yet?" is the best thing about it; like the John Hughes comedy "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," it posits travel as a Dante-esque ordeal in which the hell of the transportation system serves as a gateway to the paradise of love and family. By the time the battle-scarred Nick and his charges arrive in Vancouver, he has become the children's de facto father. 
Though the presence of the always charismatic Ice Cube makes "Are We There Yet?" watchable, the movie suffers from one insurmountable problem: as scripted by a too-many-cooks screenwriting team and cloyingly played by the young actors, little Lindsey and Kevin are such insufferable brats that the hero's change of heart remains a mystery. As Nick goes from despising his young charges to dandling them on his knee, viewers are likely to experience the same process in reverse; the children are so relentlessly shrill, their behavior so dreadful and consequence-free, that childless viewers of "Are We There Yet?" (who, to be fair, are likely to be few) may find themselves rethinking their stance on reproduction. 
"Are We There Yet?" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It contains mild profanity and a few bodily fluid-related jokes.

‽Mughal-E-Azam‽,‽NEW DELHI, India, Aug. 5—The brighter side of Indian life was dazzling tonight. The reason was the gala premiere in more than 200 theatres throughout the country of "Mughal-Azan" (the Great Mughal Ruler). It is billed as the greatest film extravaganza in years.For the Indian people, who are yet to get their first glimpse of television, this three-hour fifteen-minute saga of the sixteenth-century Moslem empire of Akbar the Great is just the escape from modern hardships that they crave. When seats went on sale at six Delhi theatres two weeks ago, the police were called to quell near riots.The film, produced in Bombay, is said to have cost 10,500,000 rupees ($2,250,000) and to have taken ten years to make.

‽Saving Marriage‽,‽An in-the-trenches, defiantly partisan and exuberantly big-hearted movie, “Saving Marriage” documents the Massachusetts imbroglio over same-sex unions with moving candor and unflagging spirits. 
When the Massachusetts Supreme Court declared the ban on gay marriage unconstitutional in 2003, the immediate backlash soon coalesced into a proposed constitutional amendment to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. Chronicling the battle to defeat that amendment, the directors, Mike Roth and John Henning, intercut tense political skirmishes with the emotional journey of a young lesbian couple whose relationship has been profoundly affected by these events. 
Defined by swells of success and troughs of despondency, the legal tussle is engrossing and sometimes revelatory; but it’s in the small, personal moments that “Saving Marriage” breaks through. When the gay rights lobbyist Arline Isaacson frets that a lifetime of discrimination may have sapped the self-esteem necessary for her supporters to defeat the amendment, or when the gay, newly elected state representative Carl Sciortino balks at publicly hugging his male supporters, the movie achieves a rare eloquence. The roots of puritanism run deep, but they’re far from invisible. 
Rambunctious and hopeful, “Saving Marriage” asks us to re-examine an institution  and a word  most of us take for granted. By the end, we may feel that saying “I do” is no different than saying “I am.” 
"Saving Marriage" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Homophobic language.

‽10 Questions for the Dalai Lama‽,‽When the filmmaker Rick Ray arrived in India to direct a travel video, an interview with the Dalai Lama was supposed to be part of his compensation. When he discovered that he would have to arrange it himself, he did, by e-mail. 
The result is “10 Questions for the Dalai Lama,” a tedious title for an anything-but-tedious film. Expertly merging the mystical and the mundane, Mr. Ray presents a warm and well-rounded portrait of his subject, his Buddhist philosophies and the painful circumstances of his exile to a modest monastery in Dharamsala, India. 
Though it touches on Tibet and China’s discordant political history (with amazing archival film and an interview with a former Chinese political prisoner), the movie is more charmed by the Dalai Lama’s personality than by his politics. 
Impish, self-deprecating and an infectious giggler, he is an unorthodox spiritual exemplar with an insatiable scientific curiosity. (“When science contradicts faith, he’s prone to choose science,” Mr. Ray marvels.) This 14th incarnation of the Dalai Lama would rather be reading about neuroscience than enduring a festival in his honor. 
As for Mr. Ray’s questions, his interviewee doesn’t hold back, whether discussing his environmentalism or the outmoded Indian caste system. He even ventures onto the thin ice of birth control. 
“Quality is more important than quantity!” is his emphatic opinion. Mother Teresa might have had something to say about that.

‽The Real Dirt on Farmer John‽,‽"What do you do when nothing is left?" is the question that drives "The Real Dirt on Farmer John," Taggart Siegel's fascinating documentary about loss and reinvention. If you're John Peterson, the progressive Illinois farmer whom Mr. Siegel filmed through 25 years of friendship and multiple crises, you pick yourself up and start again — with the camera running, of course. 
An amiable rebel who likes to taste his soil and drive his tractor while wearing a feather boa, Mr. Peterson — who also wrote and narrates the film — has always lived in front of a lens. From the home movies shot by  his mother to Mr. Siegel's epic attentions, the wildly fluctuating fortunes of the Peterson family farm provide the backdrop to a life driven as much by art as by agriculture. 
And as 1960s wiener roasts give way to frolicking '70s hippies and the farm auctions of the '80s (captured in Mr. Siegel's first documentary, "Bitter Harvest"), the movie becomes a palimpsest of images depicting the struggle between tradition and modernity. 
Firmly anchored by its protagonist's love of the land, "The Real Dirt on Farmer John" offers one man's extraordinary life as a gateway to a larger history of tragedy and transition. It's an unflinching account of what farming takes — and, more important, what it gives back.

‽
‽G.I. Jesus‽,‽This feature by Carl Colpaert, who wrote and directed, may be a mixed bag, but it is so impressive in so many ways that it demands to be taken seriously. It's a black comedy about a returning Iraq war veteran named Jesús (Joe  Arquette) that aims for an absurd, satirical tone (think "Dr. Strangelove" by way of "Coming Home") but rarely hits the mark. 
Some of the scenes between Jesús and his flirty, materialistic wife, Claudia (Patricia Mota), and their precocious daughter (Telana Lynum) are too didactically conceived, though they do boast culturally specific details rarely seen in American movies. For instance, the décor in the family's trailer home mixes traditional, seemingly antique Mexican furniture and artwork and junky modern consumer goods. 
Throughout, the film's writing is too emphatic, some of its devices are corny (particularly an Iraqi apparition played by Maurizio Farhad, who engages Jesús in Socratic dialogues about wartime violence), and its likable performances a bit wobbly in places, as if the actors weren't quite sure what was expected of them. But the film offers other pleasures, most of them visual and rhythmic. 
Chief among these is Mr. Colpaert's daring structure, reminiscent of later David Lynch films like "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Drive" — movies in which the story is told with so many odd flourishes that you aren't quite sure you can trust it, and then it literally becomes a different movie. Mr. Colpaert gets away with this by putting us inside Jesús's head from the start and making the whole onscreen world a projection of his upbringing and personality. (He's an immigrant Mexican-American Roman Catholic who longs to assimilate and who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.) 
The film's most striking element is the interweaving of grainy green night-vision imagery into Jesús's everyday existence. It's such a clever visualization of wartime trauma infecting postwar life that it's bound to be ripped off by movies with bigger budgets and less serious ambitions. 
"G.I. Jesús" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sex, nudity and violence.

‽Black Christmas‽,‽It’s been more than 30 years since the original “Black Christmas,” directed by Bob Clark from a script by Roy Moore, revealed how much fun — and how economical — it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Filled with shifting perspectives, ingenious tracking shots and a memorable performance from Margot Kidder as the sorority slut, the movie virtually invented the slasher film and inspired genre classics like “When a Stranger Calls” and “Halloween.” 
Glen Morgan’s disastrous remake not only sidelines the original’s hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Burdened with a murdered father, a grotesquely abusive mother and the fruits of an incestuous teenage quickie in the  attic, as well as a  bad case of jaundice, this killer can barely muster the energy to pick off his indistinguishably bland victims. Recast as the star instead of the creep on the other end of the phone, he blunders around, chewing on eyeballs and shrinking from the camera’s attention. He’s about as scary as the family dog. 
With a peephole-riddled set and a flashback-heavy screenplay, “Black Christmas” smothers terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, revealing too much and teasing too little. And despite some nifty camerawork — a shot of an asylum inmate gobbling Christmas dinner cuts seamlessly to a couple snogging in a car — the movie is a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. Ms. Kidder, we miss you. 
“Black Christmas” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has bloody sex, bloody murder and bloody Christmas ornaments.

‽The Good Shepherd‽,‽“The Good Shepherd,” a chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. In between there is a spicy, lively interlude in the 1930’s at Yale University, where little boys are made of skull and bones and secret societies. Yale leads to World War II, cloak and dagger and a British spy cut from the same bespoke cloth as Kim Philby. Then it’s over to Washington, where the citadels of power loom against the cheerless sky like tombstones. 
Mr. Damon, who plays a super-spy warrior in the “Bourne” films, excels at secretive men, and few are as mysterious as Edward Wilson, the spy catcher in “The Good Shepherd.” (The title refers to the Bible passage in which Jesus says: “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”) Though a composite,  Wilson seems largely based on the fascinating, freakishly paranoid James Jesus Angleton, a Yale graduate and poetry lover who served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and ran C.I.A. counterintelligence from 1954 to 1974.  Mr. Angleton cultivated orchids; Wilson builds the more prosaically symbolic miniature ships in bottles. 
Mr. Angleton is now widely thought to have hurt the C.I.A. more than he helped it, and articles on the agency’s Web site (cia.gov) frame his tenure in generally unfavorable terms (it had “devastating results,” for one). Written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro, “The Good Shepherd” doesn’t address the full consequences of that devastation, partly because it wants to take on the institution as well as the man, and partly, one imagines, because Mr. Angleton’s crippling paranoia would have been too difficult to shape into a neat narrative. “The Good Shepherd” is an origin story about the C.I.A., and for the filmmakers that story boils down to fathers who fail their sons, a suspect metaphor that here becomes all too ploddingly literal. 
Certainly fathers and sons offer a serviceable alternative to martinis and Aston Martins. Created in 1947, the C.I.A. has been responsible for many deeds, including our abiding fascination with spooks. No matter which way public sentiment shifts about the agency and its handiwork (Chile, Nicaragua), we remain fascinated with spies, or at least an idea of them, an idea in which matchbox cameras and microphones invariably figure more prominently than miles of locked filing cabinets. Secrets make agencies like the C.I.A. sexy, no matter how rumpled the raincoats. The most interesting thing about “The Good Shepherd” is how hard the filmmakers work not only to demystify the agency, but also to strip it of its allure, its heat. 
In “Betrayal,” a book about Aldrich Ames,  the double agent who for years ferried C.I.A. secrets to the Soviets, the agency is characterized as “a cross between Yale’s secret Skull and Bones society and the post office.” In its basic outline Mr. Roth’s overly busy screenplay takes the same approach to the agency as it follows Wilson’s journey through institutions of power. At Yale he joins the Skull and Bones, where the power elite helps reproduce itself by bonding and dressing like the orgiastic partygoers in “Eyes Wide Shut.” The all-male members of this clandestine group don’t have sex with one another, at least on screen, but they do mud-wrestle naked, a ritual that underscores the homosocial nature of Wilson’s world. 
Yale and World War II are the juiciest bits of the story, partly because they involve the charismatic Dr. Fredericks, played by a superb Michael Gambon. A Yale professor with a leer as insinuating as his walking stick, Dr. Fredericks tries to seduce Wilson into some antidemocratic chicanery through their shared love of poetry. (At Yale, Mr. Angleton helped found a poetry magazine in which he published Ezra Pound, a family acquaintance.) This attempted seduction parallels a rather more comical one involving Angelina Jolie, who plays Margaret Russell, the sister of  another Yale student. With her poppy-red lipstick and raucously aggressive sexuality, Margaret proves a far more successful seducer than Dr. Fredericks, as female pulchritude and power triumph over manly poetry and secrets. 
Ah, but not for long. This is a man’s world, after all, filled with specters skulking through alleys with blood on their hands and the world on their shoulders. Conscripted into the O.S.S., Wilson travels to London, where he apprentices in espionage and intelligence and meets Arch Cummings (Billy Crudup), a fop with a posh accent patterned on Kim Philby. The film shies away from the more provocative aspects of Mr. Angleton’s long acquaintance with Mr. Philby, and the years they lunched together while Mr. Philby worked for the Soviets. Whatever its true nature, the friendship hurt Mr. Angleton’s marriage, as he later admitted: “Once I met Philby, the world of intelligence that had once interested me consumed me. The home life that had seemed so important faded in importance.” 
That spells trouble for Ms. Jolie, alas, who after her spectacular entrance has to spend most of the film as the aggrieved, abandoned wife. It is not a good fit. A force of nature, Ms. Jolie reads more believably when she’s running through the jungle in boots and a bikini, as she does in the “Tomb Raider” flicks, than when standing on the sidelines in a domestic nightmare. But stand and screech and gamely slosh the booze she does while Mr. Damon’s spy helps win the war and later helps turn the C.I.A. into a shadow empire with some dependable character actors: Mr. De Niro as one of the agency’s founders, the dependably great Alec Baldwin as an F.B.I. agent and an equally fine William Hurt as the pipe-smoking head of the C.I.A. 
Mr. De Niro does fine in his avuncular role and, in the main, even better as the film’s director. He imbues “The Good Shepherd” with a funereal vibe that works especially well on the dark, dank streets of London, where Wilson learns his first repellent lesson in spy-catching, and during his early years in Washington. Among the film’s most striking visual tropes is the image of Wilson simply going to work in the capital alongside other similarly dressed men, a spectral army clutching briefcases and silently marching to uncertain victory. In silhouette the men recall the gangsters in a Jean-Pierre Melville film, even as their anonymity evokes the drones in Madeleine L’Engle’s book “A Wrinkle in Time” who are ruled by an evil disembodied brain called IT. 
Who rules the drones in “The Good Shepherd”? Who is IT? The president, the people, American mining and banana companies, the ghosts of fathers past, the agency itself? It’s hard to know, though now the C.I.A. answers to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. These are hard questions, but they are also too big, too complex and perhaps too painful for even this ambitious (2 hours, 37 minutes) project, which can only elude and insinuate, not enlighten and inform. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, and the postwar Berlin rubble looks as real as the documentary footage of Fidel Castro slipped between the lightly fictionalized intrigue, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. 
 “The Good Shepherd” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying  parent or adult guardian). There is some violence, including a scene of torture, as well as adult language and tactful sex.

‽Night at the Museum‽,‽In “Night at the Museum,” gigantism rules. This season’s answer to “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” it’s an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. 
Yes, the bag does hold some clever robotic toys, but many are broken. If you were to line up the niftiest thingamajigs created for this tale of a would-be inventor-turned-night-watchman, you might have something resembling “ ‘Jumanji’ Meets ‘The Wizard of Oz’ With a Dash of ‘Home Alone.’ ” But the fable arrives smothered in an uneasy blend of wisecracks and pallid inspirational blather. 
A self-described action-adventure comedy, “Night at the Museum” is exactly that: it wants to be all things to all people under a certain age. Shawn Levy (“Cheaper by the Dozen,” the “Pink Panther” remake), who directed from Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon’s adaptation of a book by Milan Trenc, subscribes enthusiastically to the current Hollywood philosophy that coherence doesn’t matter if enough stuff is thrown onto the screen. Contributing to the bulk is a score (by Alan Silvestri) that rivals the “Star Wars” soundtracks in pounding grandiosity. 
It’s fair to say that “Night at the Museum” is better than the insufferable Jim Carrey “Grinch,” a landmark of holiday film excess. It knows how to build excitement by steadily accelerating the pace and widening the spectacle. Almost in spite of itself, it sets off occasional little bursts of cinematic magic. 
The movie begins as a droopy family comedy about the divorced, unemployed Larry Daley (Ben Stiller, ably going through the motions), who is so down and out he may have to move from Manhattan to (gasp!) Queens. It quickly builds to a C.G.I. extravaganza unleashed in the halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. There (where the movie wasn’t actually filmed, except for exteriors), its hapless protagonist takes a job as the museum’s night watchman. 
Larry, oblivious to the strange looks on the faces of the three guards he’s replacing — Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) — has no idea what’s awaiting him. No sooner have they departed, handing him the keys with strict instructions that nothing  leave the museum, than the place  stirs to life. In no time Larry is playing frightened ringmaster to a rampaging circus of exhibits that have come to life through the magic of a priceless Egyptian tablet. 
A Tyrannosaurus rex hops off its pedestal and like a famished zombie begins clumping after Larry, who discovers that if he throws it a bone, it fetches like a dog. Cute. A stone head from Easter Island demands bubble gum. And a cheeky monkey named Dexter steals Larry’s keys, tears up his instructions and engages him in a face-slapping routine. 
At first it seems as though the menacing wild animals (both prehistoric and contemporary) will be Larry’s nemeses. But “Night at the Museum” squeezes the most juice from its historical figures, some life-sized, others miniature, some in dioramas and others on pedestals. The most amusing image is of Mr. Stiller, wide-eyed and floppy-eared, besieged by bands of tiny, finger-sized warriors furiously hurling spears and darts at him. 
Of the historical figures, Robin Williams’s Teddy Roosevelt is the noisiest. Once this statue steps off his equestrian roost, he behaves like a bossy, slogan-dispensing drill instructor, whipping Larry into moral shape. But beneath his bluster, the facsimile of the 26th president is an emotional basket case, who admits in a weak moment that he is a synthetic product manufactured in Poughkeepsie. For most of the film, he pines silently after Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck), the famous Indian tracker locked inside the glass case of a Lewis and Clark diorama. 
Profitable screen time is devoted to the continuing territorial squabble between tiny figurines of Octavius (Steve Coogan), the Roman general, and Jedediah (Owen Wilson, uncredited), a rootin’-tootin’ American cowboy. Bizarrely, the movie gives their dispute a gay subtext. In a slip of the tongue, Octavius addresses Larry as Mary, and Jedediah, quoting from “Brokeback Mountain,” tells Octavius, “I can’t quit you.” I guess it means that nowadays such smidgens of “South Park” humor are thrown into family movies to make everybody feel terribly knowing. 
But when “Night at the Museum” returns to Larry’s personal life, it dies. The movie doesn’t even make a pretense of being interested in the scenes between Larry and Nick (Jake Cherry), the 10-year-old son whose respect he is losing. And its cynical lack of concern for giving the characters human feelings is a grave drawback for a movie that wants to engage children. 
“Night at the Museum” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.

‽We Are Marshall‽,‽“We Are Marshall” is the kind of crassly formulaic movie in which everything hinges on a single play in the final seconds of a big football game. Such manipulative, adrenaline-stimulating tricks are all too commonplace, and sometimes they work. Rarely, however, has one been drawn out as shamelessly and to such damaging effect as the moment of truth in “We Are Marshall.” 
Once the ball is tossed, it hovers in slow motion while the movie pauses to reprise itself in a flashback montage that seems to last forever (20 seconds can be a lifetime). Because the snippets bear no dramatic resonance, you have the queasy sensation of a movie devouring itself in one final, desperate act of cannibalism. 
That a climactic scene meant to be charged with unbearable suspense produces nothing but impatience is all the sadder because “We Are Marshall” tells a potentially inspiring true story. On Nov. 14, 1970, a chartered jet carrying the Marshall University football team from North Carolina back to its hometown, Huntington, W.Va., crashed in the Appalachian Mountains less than a minute before its scheduled landing; 37 players, 8 coaches and university staff members, the flight crew and 25 other Huntington citizens died. There were no survivors. 
In one of its only signs of restraint, “We Are Marshall” doesn’t show the final seconds before the crash. One minute we are inside the plane during a thunderstorm; the next, the movie stops for an instant, as though the power had gone out in the projection booth. Then it resumes. 
In the months after the crash, Huntington endured a collective trauma. The story of “We Are Marshall” is of a town regaining its spirit by putting together a new college team that goes back on the field less than a year later. Its savior is Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), a goofy outsider from the College of Wooster (in Ohio) who applies for the job of head coach after a long list of candidates turn it down and molds a motley assortment of new recruits into a functioning football team. 
Mr. McConaughey, in a change of pace from his pecs-flexing duties as a romantic dreamboat, sweats hard to bring some life into his zany, sartorially challenged character, whose hairstyle (long and slicked down, with sideburns) and wardrobe (hideous flowered shirts with oversize neck-to-shoulder collars) suggests a Mad Magazine parody of early-’70s fashion horrors. 
A movie like “We Are Marshall” stands or falls on its ability to make you feel the pain and loss of individuals in a place where community pride and football are one and the same. As the film, directed by McG (the “Charlie’s Angels” movies) from a wooden screenplay by Jamie Linden, follows a handful of Huntington residents during the months after the accident, not one of them comes fully to life. 
Crucial time that should be devoted to observing people is wasted studying game strategies. And the football sequences convey little  visceral sense of participation, either as a player or as a spectator.  Had the director studied “Friday Night Lights,” a football movie that gets right everything “We Are Marshall” gets wrong, it might have been otherwise. 
Mr. McConaughey, even in hyper-cornball mode, can’t generate dramatic (or even comic) friction between himself and the script’s stick figures. Those who show some signs of life are Red Dawson (Matthew Fox), the depressed assistant coach who missed the tragic flight and lacks the heart to go back onto the field, and the stiff university president, Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn), who neither knows nor cares about football. 
The player given the most screen time is Huntington’s other savior, Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie), a gung-ho varsity athlete who also missed the flight. Almost single-handedly he mobilizes the town to demand that football be continued after the president announces his plans to suspend the program for at least a year. But Nate still comes across as little more than a shrill, rah-rah mouthpiece. 
And “We Are Marshall” is nothing if not rah-rah. By the end of the movie, the three words of its title, which become the community’s rallying cry, have been shouted into your ears so insistently you will never want to hear them again. 
“We Are Marshall” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

‽Rocky Balboa‽,‽Aw, ya can’t help but love da big Palooka! Under all dem muscles the champ’s still got a heart o’ gold. 
Who else could that be but Rocky Balboa? Sylvester Stallone’s endearing alter ego with the droopy eyes and dungeon-master croak has slouched back onto the screen, bowed but unbroken, to fight the good fight one more time. Since he was last seen 16 years ago in “Rocky V,” this two-time former heavyweight champion, now pushing 60 (Mr. Stallone’s age), has evolved a philosophy of the ring that befits an older, slower athlete. 
The measure of a prizefighter is not how much punishment you can give but how much you can take, he declares more than once. In other words, heroism equals masochism; no gain without pain. Mel Gibson would understand. 
Mr. Stallone’s body is a sight. A weightlifter’s slab of aged meat, knotted with tiny hard veins popping out of the shoulders, it is just this side of muscle-bound and somewhat grotesque. It is something you might see hung in the window of a steak house and wonder what kind of carnivore would order such a leathery, sinewy carcass. 
When I first learned of this film, presumably the final episode in the “Rocky” franchise, the idea of the 60-year-old Rocky going at it one last time sounded risible. Reports of audiences snickering derisively at trailers for the movie seemed to confirm my expectations. 
Surprisingly “Rocky Balboa,” is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It’s all heart and no credibility except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. 
For what T. S. Eliot wrote about humans being unable to bear “too much reality” is doubly true for moviegoers. Most of us go to the movies to sit in the dark and dream the impossible dream, whether it’s fighting a heavyweight bout or playing love scenes with Brad and Angelina. 
Like “Rocky,” the Bicentennial fantasy that inaugurated the series, “Rocky Balboa” is a skeletal movie, a live-action cartoon that operates on cartoon logic. Don’t ask why this former heavyweight champion still lives in squalor in South Philadelphia while owning a popular restaurant named after his sainted wife, Adrian (now five years gone from cancer)? Don’t ask why his whiny son, Robert (Milo Ventimigilia), a charmless yuppie manqué with a chip on his shoulder, does not bear the slightest resemblance to his father. 
Be happy to relive the good old times and to appreciate the touchstones that are dutifully trotted out. Here comes Rocky’s combative brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), a character seen in every Rocky movie and looking much the worse for wear, to loiter disconsolately at the restaurant for no particular reason. And here comes Bill Conti’s familiar blaring theme music when the action finally picks up. 
Now more than ever Rocky Balboa seems a throwback to the era of the chaste noble athlete who is too pure for sex. He’d rather pray at the shrine of his dead wife than think of finding a new one. When the possibility of romance presents itself in the person of Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a barmaid and single mother, who in the original “Rocky” was a teenager who hurled abuse at him, he is oblivious. But she too is a throwback. Wide-eyed and pug-faced, tough but understanding, she is a true-blue sidekick for a Dead End Kid, and Rocky, in his infinite generosity, invites her to work in his restaurant. 
“Rocky Balboa” drags its feet for a dangerously long time before the main course sashays onto the screen. When a computer-simulated match between Rocky (in his fighting prime) and the current heavyweight champion Mason (The Line) Dixon (the light heavyweight Antonio Tarver), determines that Rocky would win, people get excited. Dixon, though undefeated, has earned so little respect after a series of easy victories that his management decides that an exhibition match in which Dixon holds back his full power would be good for his career. 
A grunting and heaving training montage follows, and finally the bout, a 10-round cliffhanger in Las Vegas with every bell and whistle activated, in which neither fighter holds back. And that’s it. Gonna fly now. 
“Rocky Balboa” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has violence, but it’s confined to the ring.

‽
‽Charlotte's Web‽,‽“It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both.” So ends “Charlotte’s Web,” by E. B. White, not only one of the most beloved children’s books, but as close to perfect as any book I can think of. The arrival of a new movie version — to update the junky-looking but serviceable cartoon musical from 1973, with a voice cast that included Debbie Reynolds and Paul Lynde — is cause for anxiety as well as eagerness. On the one hand, it’s hard to ruin such fine material. On the other hand, even the smallest misjudgment might feel like a desecration. And what combination of digital imagery and traditional camera work could match the eloquence of Garth Williams’s pen-and-ink illustrations? 
But these apprehensions are no reason to blame filmmakers for trying, or to withhold praise when they succeed. Gary Winick’s film, from a script credited to Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick, may not be perfect, but it honors its source and captures the key elements — the humor and good sense, as well as the sheer narrative exuberance — that have made White’s book a classic. 
The rural setting of the book, first published in 1952, suggests a homespun, small-town simplicity, which Mr. Winick evokes with shots of clapboard farmhouses and downtown brick storefronts. No era is specified, but the clothes, cars and kitchen appliances have a vintage look. This nostalgic tableau of county fairs and wood-sided pickup trucks is not, however, the only element in White’s fictional world. Much as he cherished the bucolic quiet of Brooklin, Me., he possessed a thoroughly modern, Manhattanite sensibility. He was a country mouse only by the standards of The New Yorker. 
And “Charlotte’s Web” is a sneakily sophisticated fable. White certainly appreciated the joys of life on the farm (while evading some of its bloodier aspects), but the book is really about the benevolent, even miraculous power of celebrity. It is, most simply, the story of a spider, Charlotte A. Cavitica, who saves the life of a pig named Wilbur by making him famous. She is a gifted writer whose chosen genre is what we might now call the pull quote  — her oeuvre consists of the words “terrific,” “radiant,” “some pig” and, in a stroke of public relations genius, “humble,” all emblazoned in webbing for the world to see. Charlotte is a self-effacing manufacturer of celebrity. An eight-legged flack. It’s not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good publicist. 
It is perhaps fitting, then, that in the movie, Wilbur (voiced by Dominic Scott Kay) should hang out in a V.I.P. barn, inhabited by the likes of John Cleese (as a sheep), Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer (as geese) and Robert Redford (as a horse). Charlotte’s lines are spoken by the biggest star of all, Julia Roberts, whose voice is as precise and melodious as a well-tuned piano. (She’s much better here than she was in “The Ant Bully,” by the way. I never really bought her as a social insect.) Ms. Roberts clearly understands that what makes Charlotte such an unforgettable character is not only her generosity, but also an intellectual rigor that stops just short of pedantry and a slightly starchy sense of her own dignity. In Wilbur’s eyes, she is the ideal grown-up: a mentor, teacher and protector whose love has no stickiness or strings attached. 
The physical form of the spider — and also of her foil, Templeton the rat (Steve Buscemi) — is rendered in realistic, unflashy computer animation, which blends seamlessly with the live-action people and animals. Dakota Fanning, on the verge of outgrowing such roles, is Fern, who rescues Wilbur, the runt of the litter, from her father’s ax. When the little pig grows too big to be a house pet, he moves to the farm run by Fern’s uncle (Gary Basaraba) and aunt (Siobhan Fallon), who provide some human comic relief. A pair of crows (Thomas Haden Church  and André Benjamin) are on hand for vaudevillian banter and a few chase scenes involving Templeton. 
Mr. Winick, who previously directed “Tadpole” and “13 Going on 30,” captures the various moods of White’s clear, sprightly prose: the wry, sometimes uproarious humor, the keenly observed characters, and the unapologetic and entirely appropriate moments of high sentiment. Like the book, the film is grounded in the rhythms of the natural world, observing the progress of the seasons and, in its understated and tremendously moving conclusion, illuminating the cycle of life, death and reproduction that governs any good story. The only serious flaw in “Charlotte’s Web” is that Danny Elfman’s musical score, which is perfectly adequate if not terribly imaginative, plays under the action loudly and virtually without interruption, robbing the picture of a sense of rustic tranquillity that would ground its antic flights. 
But otherwise the movie is a delight: never coarse, rarely preachy and less concerned with proving its own cleverness than with paying tribute to the wisdom of White’s book. I am tempted to plagiarize the immortal words of its heroine: “Charlotte’s Web” is humble, and also terrific. 
“Charlotte’s Web” is rated G.

‽The Pursuit of Happyness‽,‽A fairy tale in realist drag, “The Pursuit of Happyness” is the kind of entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your craw. Inspired by a true story, as they like to say in Hollywood, the film traces the fleeting ups and frightening downs of Chris Gardner, whose efforts to keep his family from sinking into poverty evolve into a life-and-death struggle of social Darwinian proportions. It’s the early 1980s, and while Ronald Reagan is delivering the bad economic news on television, Chris is about to prove you don’t need an army to fight the war on poverty, just big smiles and smarts, and really sturdy shoes. (It also helps that the star playing him is as innately sympathetic as Will Smith.) 
Given  how often Chris breaks into a run on the streets of San Francisco, it’s a good thing his shoes are well built; his lungs, too. Written by Steven Conrad and directed by Gabriele Muccino, “The Pursuit of Happyness” recounts how Chris, plagued by some bad luck, a few stupid moves and a shrew for a wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), loses his apartment and, with his 5-year-old, Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith’s own beautiful son), joins the ranks of the homeless, if not the hopeless. Evicted from the mainstream and bounced from shelter to shelter, Chris holds firm to his dignity, resolve, faith, love and independence. His optimism sweeps through the film like a searchlight, scattering clouds and dark thoughts to the wind. 
It’s the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold. To that calculated end, the filmmaking is seamless, unadorned, transparent, the better to serve Mr. Smith’s warm expressiveness. That warmth feels truthful, as does the walk-up apartment Chris’s family lives in at the start of the film, which looks like the real paycheck-to-paycheck deal. As does the day care center, which is so crummy it can’t even get happiness right (hence the title). 
This is no small thing, considering the film industry’s usual skewed sense of economic class, a perspective encapsulated by the insider who described the middle-class family in “Little Miss Sunshine” to me as working class, perhaps because the mother drives a gently distressed Miata rather than next year’s Mercedes. 
Money matters in “The Pursuit of Happyness,” as it does in life. But it matters more openly in this film than it does in most Hollywood stories that set their sights on the poor, largely because Chris’s pursuit of happiness eventually becomes interchangeable with his pursuit of money. He doesn’t want just a better, more secure life for himself and his child; either by scripted design or by the example of the real Chris Gardner, he seems to yearn for a life of luxury, stadium box seats and the kind of sports car he stops to admire in one scene. His desires aren’t just upwardly mobile; they’re materialistically unbound. Instead of a nice starter home, he (and the filmmakers) ogles mansions. It’s no wonder he hopes to become a stockbroker. 
That may sound like a punch line, at least to some ears, but it’s the holy grail in “The Pursuit of Happyness.” A self-starter, Chris has sunk all of the family’s money into costly medical scanners that he tries to sell to doctors and hospitals. But the machines are overpriced, and the sure thing he banked on has landed them in debt. Forced to work two shifts at a dead-end job, Linda angrily smolders and then rages at Chris, which seems reasonable since he has gambled all of their savings on an exceptionally foolish enterprise. (And, unlike her, he hasn’t signed up for overtime.) But this is a film about father love, not mother love, and Linda soon leaves the picture in a cloud of cigarette smoke and a storm of tears. 
Chris and the filmmakers seem happy to see her go, but life only gets tougher once she and her paychecks disappear. Much of the film involves Chris’s subsequent efforts to keep himself and his child housed and fed while he is enrolled in an unpaid internship program at a powerful stock brokerage firm. Bright and ferociously determined, Chris easily slides into this fantastical world of shouting men, ringing phones, gleaming surfaces and benevolent bosses. He goes along to get along, and when one of his bosses asks for money to pay for a cab, he quickly opens his wallet. Chris himself stiffs another working man for some money because that wallet is so light. But this is a film about him, not the other guy. 
How you respond to this man’s moving story may depend on whether you find Mr. Smith’s and his son’s performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. Both performances are certainly likable in the extreme, though Mr. Smith shined brighter and was given much more to do when he played the title character in Michael Mann’s underrated “Ali.” That film proves an interesting comparison with this one, not in filmmaking terms, but in its vision of what it means to be a black man struggling in America. In one, a black man fights his way to the top with his fists; in the other, he gets there with a smile. 
 “The Pursuit of Happyness” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild adult language and some parental fighting.

‽Eragon‽,‽“Eragon” is what happens when misguided studio executives option a novel written by a teenager (Christopher Paolini) with a head full of Anne McCaffrey and Ursula K. Le Guin. Not full enough, however; this boy-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen’s manager. Even the scaly star, a Delft-blue beastie whose tint suggests either royal lineage or hypothermia, seems unsure of her motivation. 
Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, “Eragon” boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Ed Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. A hint of the exotic is provided by a dreadlocked Djimon Hounsou — who seems to be phoning in his lines from a booth in the Bahamas — while the marvelous Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, playing a steadily decomposing wizard, hisses incantations from a mouth resembling a nicotine-stained graveyard. 
The film’s few moments of hilarity are no less welcome for being completely unintended (the young hero’s heavy-breathing romp with a strapping male cousin could only have been envisioned by someone completely lacking in subtext radar), though “Into the sky, to win or die!” doesn’t have quite the same mythic flair as “One Ring to Rule Them All.” And if some of the characters won’t be returning for the sequel, no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. 
“Eragon” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some medieval-style violence (impalings, bashing with heavy objects) and dragon-on-dragon mauling.

‽
‽Dreamgirls‽,‽The dramatic and musical peak of “Dreamgirls” — the showstopper, the main reason to see the movie — comes around midpoint, when Jennifer Hudson, playing Effie White, sings “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going.” That song has been this musical’s calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic. A former Disney cruise-ship entertainer with a physique to match her robust voice, Ms. Hudson was notoriously dismissed from “American Idol.” This sad instance of pop-cultural philistinism is echoed on the cover of the January 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, which omits her in favor of her better-known, thinner “Dreamgirls” co-stars Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx and Beyoncé Knowles. 
Of course such slights are consistent with the character Ms. Hudson plays in Bill Condon’s film version of the show, originally written by Henry Krieger (music) and Tom Eyen (book and lyrics). Effie is, at first, the lead singer in a Detroit vocal trio called the Dreamettes (later the Dreams), and also the lover of Curtis Taylor Jr. (Mr. Foxx), the car salesman turned musical entrepreneur who serves as the group’s manager. She is replaced, both onstage and in Curtis’s affections, by Deena Jones (Ms. Knowles), her skinnier, lighter-skinned and more pliable sidekick, and relegated to poverty and obscurity while the group ascends into the pop firmament (and also leaves the crumbling Motor City for Los Angeles). 
“And I Am Telling You,” for all the defiance of its lyric and the triumphal swell of its orchestration, is thus an anthem of impotence, a proud woman’s protest in the face of humiliation and defeat. Like it or not, Effie is going. She has no choice in the matter. But it’s not often you go to the movies and see a big-boned, sexually assertive, self-confident black woman — not played for laughs or impersonated by a male comedian in drag — holding the middle of the screen. And when was the last time you saw a first-time film actress upstage an Oscar winner, a pop diva and a movie star of long standing? Ms. Hudson is not going anywhere. She has arrived. 
The vehicle that delivers her, however, does not always run smoothly. “Dreamgirls” is a souped-up, collectors’-edition replica of a model that Detroit — I mean Hollywood — used to turn out with ease and regularity. At the moment,  and maybe only for a moment, stage musicals seem to be in reasonably good health, with solid revivals and lively new shows filling Broadway theaters. At the multiplexes, however, it’s a grimmer story. 
Periodic attempts to reinvigorate the form have a way of embalming it in nostalgia or tricking it out with frantic novelty. Or both. See “Moulin Rouge.” Audiences who go to “Dreamgirls” will have a good time, but they’ll be going for old time’s sake rather than to encounter anything vital or new. 
And if “Dreamgirls” is disappointing, it is not for lack of effort by Mr. Condon or his cast, who do their best to combine the big, showy gestures of stage performance with the finer-grained demands of naturalistic screen acting. Like Mr. Condon’s other films — “Gods and Monsters,” “Kinsey” and “Chicago” (which he wrote but did not direct) — “Dreamgirls” takes place at the intersection of fame and desire, where sexual longing gets mixed up with hunger for public recognition. 
No one in the movie expresses this tension better than Mr. Murphy, whose character, a soul singer named James (Thunder) Early, fights addiction, obsolescence and the demands of his own ego. Resorting frequently to the shorthand of montage, Mr. Condon for the most part succeeds in sustaining a narrative and emotional flow that links one song to the next. 
But the problem with “Dreamgirls” — and it is not a small one — lies in those songs, which are not just musically and lyrically pedestrian, but historically and idiomatically disastrous. This is a musical, after all, about music, about an especially vibrant and mutable strain of rhythm and blues that proclaimed itself, boastfully but not inaccurately, to be “the sound of young America.” 
Curtis is modeled — loosely enough to escape litigation — on Berry Gordy Jr., who turned Motown from a regional record label into a powerhouse. (The Dreams are a parallel-universe version of the Supremes.) The story of Curtis’s Rainbow Records is a familiar and potent tale of Faustian show-business ambition, as his climb to the top involves betraying and hurting the people closest to him. But without the right soundtrack, only half the story is being told. The performances are gratifyingly spirited, but what this movie most obviously lacks is soul. 
The great Motown songwriters — Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, the trio of geniuses known to posterity as Holland-Dozier-Holland — turned out great pop songs by the dozen, cutting bolts of blues, gospel and rock ’n’ roll into clean, trim, shiny garments. It is vain to imagine that Mr. Krieger and Mr. Eyen, who died in 1991, could replicate the Motown sound in all its variety, but as it is, the film barely acknowledges its existence. 
As the cushioned blasts of overorchestrated thunder assaulted my ears, I would have given anything for a crisp horn chart, a clean drum line, a chattering rhythm guitar or even a memorably witty or catchy verse. Periodically, a character — Curtis, James or Effie’s songwriter brother C. C. (Keith Robinson) — will announce the arrival of a “new sound.” But even though the chronology and the costumes march from doo-wop to disco, everything in “Dreamgirls” sounds more or less the same, as the splashy imperatives of show-tune composing overwhelm everything in their path. 
The music has the effect of compromising one of the crucial ambitions of the film: to refract the recent history of black America (and, by implication, America itself) through the prism of popular culture. Part of Curtis’s dream is to cross over and in the process permanently redefine the mainstream, and you hear a lot of talk about what kind of music will appeal to black or white ears. 
You also see archival images (the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; riots in Detroit) that register the aspirations and disappointments of America in the 1960s. But the music provides no guidance through the times, and as it tries to negotiate a period of profound change, it comes to rely on the talents of its production and costume designers, John Myhre and Sharen Davis, both of whom do brilliant work. The decades are marked by the progression of hairstyles, lapels, jewelry and dresses; after a while the experience starts to feel like a long, noisy guided tour through a museum. 
Except of course that the dioramas occasionally spring to life when the singers transcend the limitations of the songs. This happens, most memorably, twice: when Ms. Hudson lays claim to “And I Am Telling You,” and when Ms. Knowles, late in the movie, lets loose in a recording booth on “Listen,” one of a handful of new songs written for the film. 
Until that point her character, Deena, has been something of an enigma and, for Curtis, the passive vessel of his ambitions.   Ms. Knowles’s performance has been static and detached. In her limited work in movies she has never seemed comfortable with acting, shying away from any emotional display that might compromise her steely, hieratic dignity. But when she sings, she is capable of warmth, vulnerability, even ferocity, all of which she demonstrates in “Listen.” You cannot help but obey the imperative of the song’s title, even as you may wish the movie offered more that was worth listening to. 
“Dreamgirls” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some sexual content, profanity and drug use.

‽Unaccompanied Minors‽,‽“Unaccompanied Minors,” directed by Paul Feig and written by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark, presents a nightmarish, dystopian vision of contemporary America in which airline deregulation and the prevalence of divorce have turned our airports into grim holding pens for feral children and embittered workers. Not for the faint of heart, the movie is unsettling and startlingly true to life. 
At least that’s how it seemed to me. To the minors I happened to be accompanying, it seemed to be reasonably good fun. Far from horrifying or enraging them, the failure of just about every grown-up except Wilmer Valderrama to behave decently and responsibly filled them with delight, much as the pervasive adult cluelessness provided the movie’s main characters with opportunities for mischief and friendship. 
Set on Christmas Eve at a snowed-in Midwestern airport, “Unaccompanied Minors” assembles a squad of familiar adolescent movie types. There’s the nice guy, unfairly labeled a loser (Dyllan Christopher); the rich girl (Gina Mantegna); the angry delinquent girl (Quinn Shephard); the anti-social fat boy (Brett Kelly). In a remarkable feat of economy, the nerd, the black kid and the Jew are all rolled into the agile, jug-eared person of Tyler James Williams. Individually and then collectively, these children run afoul of Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), who is the airport’s director of passenger relations and the movie’s designated Scrooge. His underling, Zach (Mr. Valderrama), is torn between the demands of his boss and his compassion for the kids. 
Mr. Black’s fellow alumnus from “The Daily Show,”  Rob Corddry, plays an environmental-activist dad who tries to rescue his children in a biodiesel-powered Mercedes. The explosion of that vehicle is one of a few moments of loud, obvious comic action that seem to have been included to justify the status of “Unaccompanied Minors” as a theatrically released motion picture, rather than the kiddie-cable seasonal special it should have been. In any case, this movie may be too much for sensitive parents to bear. Send your kids alone. 
“Unaccompanied Minors” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some crude humor and a few very mild sexual innuendoes.

‽Ever Again‽,‽You may wonder why you’re not feeling more outrage as you watch “Ever Again,” a documentary that seeks to shine a spotlight on recent examples of anti-Semitism, primarily in Europe. Perhaps it’s the disjointed presentation, frustratingly short on context and complexity. Perhaps it’s Kevin Costner’s narration, which is somewhere between a low-grade whine and an aid-to-sleep tape. Perhaps it’s the natural human resistance to being lectured, no matter how noble the intent; the film is by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and displays its one-sidedness unabashedly. 
Certainly “Ever Again”  could have been  more powerful without much more effort.  It undercuts itself by being an indiscriminate grab bag. Legitimate discussion points — for instance, that some of today’s Jews invoke the suffering of the Holocaust to excuse whatever actions they care to take — are lumped in with the most preposterous of statements (“Muslims love everybody, but the Jewish hate Muslims,” one man asserts), as if they’re all self-evidently anti-Semitic. 
Just as irksomely, the film is afraid to explore its most compelling ideas. Early on, Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard legal scholar (who is heard from frequently in the film), suggests that even people who don’t much care about the Jews should be alarmed by rising anti-Semitism. “The Jews have always been the canary in the mine,” he says: the same extremism that takes aim at them eventually comes looking for other targets. Also interesting is the notion that anti-Semitism is no longer the exclusive province of the far right; it is also becoming fashionable on the left. But neither idea is fleshed out because  the film is too eager to get to the next outrageous clip of hate speech. 
Yet perhaps, dismayingly, bad filmmaking isn’t really to blame for the lack of punch in “Ever Again.” Perhaps it’s the familiarity of it all. A documentary using this same formula could be made by homosexuals, blacks, Muslims, immigrants and a hundred other aggrieved groups, and probably has been. In this film and in the world at large, the chorus of complaints seems a whole lot louder than the voices of tolerance and enlightenment.

‽The Holiday‽,‽The director Nancy Meyers gets a kick out of romantic love, but she also grooves to its agonies, particularly those of the more prolix kind. In her neo-screwball world of dizzy dames and the heartbreakers who do and done them wrong, love is a drug, an escape, an ordeal and a ready excuse for a lot of chatter. The men and women in a Nancy Meyers film don’t just fall in love; they talk about falling in love, about falling out of love, about needing, fearing and surrendering to love. They would, I imagine, have driven Raymond Carver crazy. 
Ms. Meyers can also drive her fans crazy, largely because her ravenous need to please the audience sometimes gets in the way of her talent. In the fizzy “Something’s Gotta Give,” a romantic comedy that holds up to repeat viewings, even on airplanes, where it nicely fills the small screen, this eagerness dovetails beautifully with Diane Keaton’s fidgety performance as a woman stunned by new love. (And with Jack Nicholson, no less.) The underlying anxiousness of the filmmaking, the almost obsessive reliance on patter and pratfalls, and even the neurotic tastefulness of the costumes and sets (every outfit is just right, every bibelot just so) find a perfect corollary in each of Ms. Keaton’s artful, becoming twitches and blushes. 
There are similar currents of unease in “The Holiday,” most generated by Iris, a lovesick English rose played by Kate Winslet, and by the wobbliness of the narrative framework. Employed by The Daily Telegraph in London, where she has improbably scored an office for writing the wedding column, Iris is in love with Jasper (Rufus Sewell). She has also committed to an unfortunate type of romantic masochism because while he’s the flame, these days she’s only the keeper. 
Though he now makes time with a twiggy brunette (as Iris cries into her computer), the exes nonetheless come across as cozy as old slippers. It’s not clear if the relationship was ever consummated, but it has puttered along for years, fired by her desire and fanned by his need for her adoration. 
Ms. Winslet is always a welcome screen presence, and if this were the story of how Iris eventually chucked Jasper aside for someone worthier, say, like Hugh Grant in “Love Actually” or the dodgier (if sexier) Hugh Grant of the Bridget Jones comedies, it might be easier to fall for “The Holiday.” But Ms. Meyers, whose ambitions are telegraphed by her film’s title, which directly invokes George Cukor’s lovely 1938 romp “Holiday,” has created a cumbersome vehicle by saddling Iris with a flamboyantly glamorous Los Angeles double, Amanda. As played by Cameron Diaz with oodles of charm and not an ounce of persuasion, Amanda doesn’t as much mirror Iris’s love troubles as throw them into wincing relief. 
On the brink of Christmas, these two strangers trade homes for the holidays and land smack in each other’s lifestyles. Amanda ends up in a sweet country cottage that looks as if it has been drawn by Beatrix Potter, while Iris moves into a Los Angeles mansion with a maid and a pool large enough for the Olympics. There is a huge Robert Longo  hanging over the staircase and a flat-screen TV on which Iris delights in Hollywood treasures with Barbara Stanwyck that Ms. Meyers fires up like beacons. In case Iris or anyone else misses the point, there is also a sweet-and-sour old-studio screenwriter (a sly Eli Wallach) who waxes indignant about what has happened to the movies while his dusty Oscar stands watch. 
“The Holiday” is a tale of two women, two houses, two love interests — Jude Law pairs with Ms. Diaz, Jack Black gets lucky with Ms. Winslet — but it’s also about movie love. There is something touching if willfully naïve about Ms. Meyers’s nostalgia for Hollywood’s golden age, when Louis B. Mayer ruled the very lot on which she shot part of this film. If her name had been Ned, not Nancy, she might have thrived then. She wouldn’t have been allowed to go amusingly (or maddeningly) off point, but her commercial instincts would have been encouraged, her indulgences — like filling mouths with speeches, not dialogue — squelched. An old-studio producer would have recognized that there are several films jammed into this one and maybe called in Ben Hecht for a polish, even as he recognized that Ms. Meyers always has something to give. 
“The Holiday” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some adult language and suggestions of lovemaking.

‽
‽Blood Diamond‽,‽The makers of “Blood Diamond,” an exceptionally foolish thriller starring a most excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger.  The story involves so-called conflict diamonds, illicitly mined stones that have been used to finance some of the most vicious wars in Africa. If films were judged solely by their good intentions, this one would be best in show. Instead, gilded in money and dripping with sanctimony, confused and mindlessly contradictory, the film is a textbook example of how easily commercialism can trump do-goodism, particularly in Hollywood. 
Mr. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler  who, having been orphaned during his native country’s violent struggles in the 1970s, has spent most of his 30-some years crisscrossing the continent as a soldier of fortune and a merchant of misery. Tousled and tanned, with a long, slicing gait and a killer smile, Danny looks as if he were born for trouble of the sweetest kind. But Mr. DiCaprio, perhaps because he knows that much of the audience has already crawled into his pocket, plays the smuggler as the scum he is.  Even as the film coaxes Danny toward redemption, the actor fights to hold his ground and the truth of a character who has inspired the most fully sustained performance of his adult life. 
This being an Edward Zwick film, it’s no surprise that redemption is on the menu. Mr. Zwick likes to make epic-size movies about men of anguish and conscience who, whether they wear Civil War blue (“Glory”) or a Meiji kimono (“The Last Samurai”), invariably land on the side of the angels. Danny is initially on the side of the devils, and when we first meet him in 1999 he is trying to cross the border of  a perilously unstable Sierra Leone with a stash of diamonds tucked into some goats.  Busted by a patrol from Sierra Leone, he lands in jail, where he soon hears of a precious pink diamond  unearthed by a fisherman turned unwilling miner, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). 
The chase is on, and on. Written by Charles Leavitt, “Blood Diamond” more or less plays like an exotically situated action flick as each man races toward his respective goal. Solomon hopes to reunite with his wife and three children, from whom he has been violently separated; Danny just wants a score big enough to pay his way permanently out of Africa. Theirs might be a match made in movie-genre heaven if the filmmakers didn’t insist  on wagging their fingers in our faces and delivering dire statistics by the ream, the intimations of Antwerp intrigue and an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), whose preferred interview method involves shimmying up to her subject like a pole dancer. 
If the sociopolitical context weren’t so appalling,  this ludicrous characterization and Ms. Connelly’s equally woeful performance would be easy to laugh off. But both are insulting because they transpire against a backdrop of human suffering, suffering that Maddy sternly lectures Danny for exploiting even as she snaps another photograph of the very same. (Say what!?) Any question that the filmmakers might be clued into Maddy’s cluelessness, might be directly engaging the contradictions involved whenever misery becomes fodder for entertainment, is answered by the documentarylike images of children roaming a mound of garbage, by the blank-looking men and women sitting in trash-strewn streets and by the periodically brandished arm and leg stumps. The horror, the horror. 
Like “The Constant Gardener,” this film betrays an almost quasi-touristic fascination with images of black Africans, who function principally as colorful scenery or, as in the gruesome scenes inside rebel training camps, manifestations of pure evil. Pure evil that, incidentally, likes to listen to rap and, in one case, wears a Snoop Dogg T-shirt along with his gat. Good as gold, Solomon earns a sizable share of screen time, and though the performance is expectedly sympathetic, the character has none of Danny’s complexity, which means that he’s inherently less interesting. Mr. Hounsou, who first came to attention as a noble African in “Amistad” and has often had to play the same role since, must be awfully tired of holding his head up so high. 
“Blood Diamond” means well, but it also means box-office business. Hollywood has always traveled to faraway places (or at least tricked out sound stages) to spin yarns about moral calamity perfumed with the exotic. Whether down Mexico way or in Morocco, it generally kept the atmospheric extras — the snake-hipped dancing girl, the scoundrel in the burnoose, the smiler in the fez — stashed in the background, where they wouldn’t distract from the star attractions. “Blood Diamond” wants to bring those blurred figures closer into view, notably through Solomon. But the rushing camerawork, breakneck editing, compulsion to go, go, go onto the next genre beat mean that there is next to no time for such niceties. The faces remain obscured, the voices muted, even as Danny comes sharply into focus. 
The tragedy of Sierra Leone and the complicity of Americans, who buy more diamonds than any other consumers in the world, deserve louder, more clamorous attention than the occasional news report.  And certainly big-budget Hollywood action films are plenty loud and plenty clamorous, and the volume is only    turned up to shrieking with the addition of the international heartthrob who, by sacrificing himself on the altar of love in “Titanic,” conquered a generation of young female fans (the same demographic most likely to brandish a rock on its ring finger). 
Yet while Mr. DiCaprio turns out to be an ideal fit for “Blood Diamond,” there’s an insolvable disconnect between this serious story and the frivolous way it has been told. There is no reason to doubt the filmmakers’ sincerity; only their filmmaking. 
“Blood Diamond” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes scenes of extreme violence, some of which involve child soldiers.

‽
‽Off the Black‽,‽In “Off the Black” Nick Nolte dives beneath the blubber to bare the weary soul of Ray Cook, an automobile junkyard operator pushing 60 who also umpires high-school baseball games. A heaving wreck of a man, Ray lives alone in a seedy cottage near a railroad track and drinks himself into a stupor each night in front of the television. 
Although he leaves Post-it messages in the refrigerator reminding himself to keep to a three-beer limit, he is incapable of following his own rules. In more sober moments he videotapes himself recounting the day’s activities for a diary. As he leaves a medical examination, his doctor throws up his hands in frustration; he wouldn’t know where to begin operating. We get the message: Ray’s days are numbered. 
“Off the Black,” the feature-film debut of the director James Ponsoldt, tells the formulaic story of Ray’s last hurrah, in which he blackmails a teenager into posing as his son and accompanying him to his 40th high-school reunion. As he and the pretender, Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), go through the ritual, Mr. Nolte’s craggy face and phlegmy growl register every seismic rumble of Ray’s troubled psyche. And he and Mr. Morgan (likeably fresh but far from dewy-eyed) sustain a convincing rapport. 
This modest film could easily have skidded into the mawkish marshland where countless mentor-protégé, father-son dramas have suffocated. But for the most part it steers away from the worst clichés of that tear-drenched genre. 
Ray and Dave first cross paths in a male version of meeting cute. Umpiring a ballgame in which Dave is pitching, Ray makes a critical call that walks a batter who scores the winning run. (The title “Off the Black” refers to a pitch that just misses the strike zone.) In revenge Dave and two teammates vandalize Ray’s property, strewing the trees with toilet paper, scrawling graffiti on the pavement outside the house and breaking one of his car windows. 
As they flee, Ray wakes from his haze, grabs a gun and rushes outside, where he catches Dave and drags him into the house. Once they calm down, the frightened boy agrees to clean up the mess if Ray doesn’t call the police. 
As Dave undoes the damage, the two become acquainted, and Ray develops enough of a liking for the vandal to take him fishing on the local river (the movie was filmed in upstate New York) and to offer him fishy advice. (“If you haven’t fished, you don’t know anything about women.”) 
The movie follows Dave into his own troubled home where his father, a professional photographer (Timothy Hutton in an underwritten role), has been depressed since his wife left two years earlier. Frustratingly, the movie offers no explanation of why she left. 
Dave’s family history is only one of several plot strands that seem as if they might have been edited out of the movie. Dave also has an uneasy relationship with his younger sister (but why?) and develops a flirtatious friendship with a single mother (Rosemarie DeWitt) who is a friend of Ray’s (but how good a friend and from where?). As a rehearsal for the reunion, Ray drags Dave to a hospital to visit Ray’s father (Michael Higgins), who has Alzheimer’s, and play the old man’s grandson; Dave passes the test. 
“Off the Black” is so much Mr. Nolte’s movie that it couldn’t exist without him. His character is the latest in a long line of Hemingway-esque ruins, marinated in beer and testosterone, who have become Mr. Nolte’s specialty. 
As fond as he is of these guys, Mr. Nolte has the wisdom and acting smarts not to sentimentalize them. In these roles you often have the sense of this wonderful actor casting a pitiless, smirking gaze into the mirror as he contemplates his own decaying magnificence. 
 “Off the Black” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some profanity.

‽
‽Apocalypto‽,‽“I’m going to peel off his skin and make him watch me wear it.” This grisly threat is delivered by one of the main bad guys in Mel Gibson’s  “Apocalypto.” The promised flaying never takes place, but viewers who share this director’s apparently limitless appetite for gore will not be disappointed, since not much else in the way of bodily torment has been left to the imagination. There are plenty of disembowelings, impalings, clubbings and beheadings. Hearts are torn, still beating, from slashed-open chests. A man’s face is chewed off by a jaguar. Another’s neck is pierced by darts tipped with frog venom. Most disturbing, perhaps, is the sight of hundreds of corpses haphazardly layered in an open pit: a provocative and ill-advised excursion into Holocaust imagery on this director’s part. 
Violence has become the central axiom in Mr. Gibson’s practice as a filmmaker,  his major theme and also his chief aesthetic interest. The brutality in “Apocalypto” is so relentless and extreme that it sometimes moves beyond horror into a kind of grotesque comedy, but to dismiss it as excessive or gratuitous would be to underestimate Mr. Gibson’s seriousness. And say what you will about him — about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews — he is a serious filmmaker. 
Which is not to say that “Apocalypto” is a great film, or even that it can be taken quite as seriously as it wants to be. Mr. Gibson’s technical command has never been surer; for most of its 2-hour 18-minute running time, “Apocalypto,” written by Mr. Gibson and Farhad Safinia, is a model of narrative economy, moving nimbly forward and telling its tale with clarity and force. It is, above all, a muscular and kinetic action movie, a drama of rescue and revenge with very little organic relation to its historical setting. Yes, the dialogue is in various Mayan dialects, which will sound at least as strange to American ears as the Latin and Aramaic of “The Passion of the Christ,” but the film’s real language is Hollywood’s, and Mr. Gibson’s, native tongue. 
When I first heard about this project, and later when I saw the early trailers, I halfway hoped that Mr. Gibson might turn out to be an American (or half-Australian) version of Werner Herzog, setting out into the jungle to explore the dark and tangled regions of human nature. Once you get past the costumes and the subtitles, though, the most striking thing about “Apocalypto” is how comfortably it sits within the conventions of mainstream moviemaking. It is not an obsessive opera like Mr. Herzog’s “Aguirre: The Wrath of God,” but rather a pop period epic in the manner of “Gladiator” or “Braveheart,” and as such less interested in historical or cultural authenticity than in imposing an accessible scheme on a faraway time and place. 
The setting is Central America before the arrival of the Spanish, when the Maya empire, in Mr. Gibson’s version, was already in the process of collapsing from within. The basic moral conflict — as it was in “Braveheart,” directed by and starring Mr. Gibson, and in “The Patriot,” a vehicle for him directed by Roland Emmerich — is between a small group of people trying to live simple, decent, traditional lives and a larger, more powerful political entity driven by bloodlust and greed. This kind of conservative anti-imperialism runs consistently through Mr. Gibson’s work;  whether the empire in question is Roman, British or Mesoamerican, and whatever its political resonance might be, it allows the viewer to root for an unambiguously virtuous underdog. 
“Apocalypto” begins with a group of young men out on a hunt and lingers for a while in their happy, earthy village, a place that might double as a nostalgic vision of small-town America were it not for the loin cloths, the tattooed buttocks and the facial piercings. Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) is nagged by his mother-in-law and teased by his buddies because he hasn’t yet made his wife pregnant, but he accepts his humiliation in good humor, like the jolly fat kid on a family sitcom. 
Meanwhile Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose father (Morris Birdyellowhead) is an admired hunter and warrior, snuggles down with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their young son, Turtle Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). There’s fresh tapir meat on the grill and an old-timer telling stories by the fire. Life is good. 
Needless to say, this pastoral idyll cannot last. The ominous strains of James Horner’s score indicate as much. Before long the village is set upon by fearsome marauders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), who rape, burn and kill with ruthless discipline and undisguised glee. The locals resist valiantly, but the survivors are led away to an uncertain fate. Seven and Turtle Run stay behind, hidden in a hole in the ground. 
Jaguar Paw’s mission will be to rescue them and also to avenge his friends and kin. First, though, he will accompany us on a Cecil B. DeMille tour of the decadent imperial capital, a place of misery, luxury and corruption, where priests and nobles try to keep famine and pestilence at bay with round-the-clock human sacrifices. 
Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of “Apocalypto” is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director’s skill. 
Perhaps because he is aiming for an audience wary of subtitles, Mr. Gibson rarely uses dialogue as a means of exposition, and he proves himself to be an able, if not always terribly original, visual storyteller. He is not afraid of clichés — the slow-motion, head-on sprint toward the camera; the leap from the waterfall into the river below — but he executes them with a showman’s maniacal relish. 
And it is, all in all, a pretty good show. There is a tendency, at least among journalists, to take Mr. Gibson as either a monster or a genius, a false choice that he frequently seems intent on encouraging. Is he a madman or a visionary? Should he be shunned or embraced? Censured or forgiven? 
These are the wrong questions, but their persistence reveals the truth about this shrewd and bloody-minded filmmaker. He is an entertainer. He will be publicized, and he will be paid. 
“Apocalypto” is rated R (Under 17 must be accompanied by parent or adult guardian). See the first paragraph above.

‽
‽Quantum Hoops‽,‽Well now, if this isn’t just the cutest thing I don’t know what is. “Quantum Hoops,” a documentary by Rick Greenwald, tells the story of the California Institute of Technology’s men’s basketball team — a topic that in the context of college sports is approximately as farcical as the history of aspiring semioticians among the contestants on “America’s Next Top Model.” 
Established in 1919, the Caltech Beavers (so named after “nature’s engineer”) cull players from one of the most rigorously selective, academically demanding universities in the world. These boys are quite literally rocket scientists —  or, more accurately, double majors in rocket science and applied math. 
David Duchovny, who narrates this wry, good-natured picture with affable bemusement, informs us that Caltech lays claim to both the highest ratio of Nobel Prize winners to faculty and a men’s basketball team that at the time of filming was distinguished by a record 243 consecutive conference losses dating to 1985. Mr. Greenwald follows the Beavers’ try at breaking that losing streak during the final week of the 2006 season, while chronicling the handful of ups and many, many downs in the history of a team remembered less for its athletic prowess (or even competence) than for once including the father of modern computational fluid dynamics. 
QUANTUM HOOPS 
The Caltech Basketball Story 
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.  
Written, directed, produced and edited by Rick Greenwald; director of photography, Lauren Langford,; music by Brian Arbuckle; released by Green Forest Films. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes. This film is not rated. 
‽
‽Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem‽,‽The second “Aliens vs. Predator” film is, like its predecessor, one very dark movie. Not psychologically dark; dark  dark, as in, not very generously lighted. 
The first film took place largely underground, in Antarctica. The new one, which opened Tuesday, first finds itself in the sewers of a Colorado town, where the title, um, characters are doing battle. And then, after the intergalactic struggle moves to the local power plant, the electricity for the whole region is knocked out. Bring your night-vision goggles to this one. 
You might wonder if the shadowiness is a subtle admission of shame: “We don’t want anyone looking too closely at this thing.” But “Requiem,” as the new film is subtitled, has nothing to be ashamed of. It may not be classic sci-fi like the original “Alien,” which it has in its DNA, but it’s a perfectly respectable next step in the series. 
Reiko Aylesworth from “24” and Steven Pasquale from “Rescue Me” provide some acting cred as two residents of a small town in which a spaceship crash-lands. The film doesn’t seem interested in drawing any new fans to the series, because it doesn’t bother to provide any back story, but here’s the gist of it: The predators from the “Predator” films hunt the aliens of the “Alien” films, using Earth as a sort of practice range because the aliens breed inside humans. 
The first film ended with a new wrinkle: An alien bred inside a dead predator. As “Requiem” opens, the hybrid hatches aboard a predator space ship, all heck breaks loose, and the crash-landing is the result. 
Another predator is dispatched to Earth to track down the aliens, which have escaped from the crashed ship and are busily suction-cupping onto the faces of every Coloradoan in sight. 
Greg and Colin Strause, the directors, and Shane Salerno, the screenwriter, give the humans in the story much more attention than they received in the first film, which makes for a far more watchable movie. The story is fairly generic try-to-get-away stuff, but it’s decently rendered. There are a couple of classic horror-film bits in among the sci-fi — oh, you young people, don’t you know that skinny dipping attracts malevolent creatures? — and even one pretty funny joke. 
There is also a nice life-or-death choice for the survivors: go await a promised airlift, or go with the resourceful Ms. Aylesworth to look for a helicopter? Robert Joy is a perfect low-key villain in military guise. 
“Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem” is rated R (Under 17  requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence, gore and salty language.

‽The Water Horse‽,‽Many lonely children yearn for a pet to call their own. In “The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep,” based on a novel by Dick King-Smith, a  boy, Angus (Alex Etel), finds not only that, but a best friend as well, after the mysterious egg he stumbles across hatches a creature unlike any he’s ever seen. Adorable and full of mischief, his new companion, Crusoe, who looks something like a cross between a dinosaur and a snail, immediately adds spice to his drab life. 
Set in 1942 in coastal Scotland, the film consistently evokes an authentic sense of time and place and features remarkable computer-generated graphics work from Weta Workshop, the company responsible for the groundbreaking visuals of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. 
When Crusoe grows into the magnificent Loch Ness Monster and must be released to sea, its survival skills are put to the test, and the aggressive pursuit of the creature by townspeople and visiting soldiers alike stirs up “King Kong”-esque feelings of dread. 
Brian Cox appears briefly, serving as the film’s present-day narrator. His character’s identity offers no surprise — nor does much else in the film — but that detracts little from this family-friendly escapist fare that should enthrall, without insult, fantasy-minded viewers of any age. 
“The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has mild violence.

‽The Great Debaters‽,‽Its steadfast humanity, its literacy, its passionate belief in education, its faith that history teaches invaluable lessons and its strong, emotionally grounded performances: There are enough things to admire about “The Great Debaters,” the heavily fictionalized true story of The Little Debate Team That Could, that your impulse is to forgive the movie its shortcomings. 
The second film directed by Denzel Washington, “The Great Debaters” may not aspire to be more than inspirational pop entertainment in the Oprah Winfrey mode (Ms. Winfrey is one of its producers), but unlike so many films of its ilk,  it doesn’t insult your intelligence. And it reminds you that social history airbrushed for the screen by Hollywood is preferable to none at all. Despite its cosmetic embellishments, “The Great Debaters” obviously emanates from the heart. It makes you nostalgic for prototypes like Stanley Kramer’s socially conscious message movies of the 1950s and ’60s and for the era that produced them. 
As an enduring American myth, the triumph of the sanctified underdog, an intrepid spirit who doesn’t compromise his integrity on the slippery path to victory, may be much the worse for wear in these Darwinian times, but it can still produce a lump in your throat. The real tale  of the unlikely ascendance  of the debate team at Wiley College, a small all-black institution in Marshall, Tex., in 1935, follows the template of countless sports movies. Perseverance and teamwork lead to untarnished glory. 
In its tone, though not in its content, “The Great Debaters” is the sequel to Mr. Washington’s 2002 directorial debut, “Antwone Fisher,” in which he played a Navy psychiatrist whose tough love helps save a broken soul. Here he portrays the noted poet, social activist and educator Melvin B. Tolson, who coached the Wiley College team. Righteous, autocratic and fearless, Mr. Washington’s Tolson is a screen descendant of the stern East London schoolteacher played by Sidney Poitier 40 years ago in “To Sir, With Love.” If Mr. Washington’s two films are considerably richer in content than that civil rights-era weepie, at heart they are no less sentimental. 
Tolson is not only a ferocious coach but also a political firebrand (there are mutterings about his being a Communist) who runs afoul of the local sheriff (John Heard) for his organizing of the mixed-race Southern Tenant Farmers  Union. But whether Tolson is teaching or organizing, Mr. Washington imbues him with the authority of a persuasive orator and a moral Rock of Gibraltar. 
“The Great Debaters” is aware that debating, an activity synonymous with nerdiness, needs a shot of adrenaline to be sexy to a mass audience. Early in the movie Tolson barks with the ferocity of a Marine Corps drill instructor, “Debate is a blood sport.” As the team starts winning, his severity never diminishes. The debates themselves are swiftly edited compendiums of best-of moments. 
The four teammates handpicked by Tolson are Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), a handsome,  clean-cut youth with a lurking bad-boy streak; Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), a dutiful eager beaver whose family pressures him to drop out when Tolson’s radical political organizing comes to light; Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), a strait-laced aspiring lawyer and soft-edged proto-feminist; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a preacher’s son whose father (Forest Whitaker) keeps him on a tight leash. 
Despite his name, the actor playing James Jr. is unrelated to either Mr. Washington or to Forest Whitaker. It is worth noting that the senior Farmer was the first African-American in Texas to earn a doctorate. His son, a leader of the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s, founded the Congress of Racial Equality. 
This being Hollywood, a soupçon of romance is required. The movie dawdles only as long as necessary on the pudgy, cow-eyed young James’s hopeless infatuation with Samantha, who becomes romantically involved with Henry. 
“The Great Debaters” doesn’t shy away from showing the humiliation and persecution of blacks in the Jim Crow South. When James Farmer Sr., accompanied by his family, accidentally runs over a pig, his humiliation at the hands of the owner and his redneck buddies makes your stomach turn. 
Later, Tolson, driving home from a debate with his students, comes upon a lynching. The flashes of the hideous atrocity sear your mind, and when the mob, still riled with blood lust, chases the car, your heart is in your throat. Afterward, Henry’s shame and stifled fury drive him to a self-destructive spree. 
Robert Eisele’s screenplay imagines a smooth historical arc. The characters’ reactions to these events, it implies, sow the seeds of the civil-rights movement, which is also foreshadowed in the debates, whose topics too conveniently address civil-rights issues. Strangely, the Wiley College team always argues the progressive view. Its initial push to break the color barrier in college debating by competing with a white college in Oklahoma is too neatly paralleled by the debate topic: whether blacks should be allowed to attend state universities. A more intellectually subtle, less manipulative movie would have had the Wiley team arguing at least once against African-American interests. 
Even though the film makes it clear that the team’s speeches are prepared in advance by Tolson, the literary and historical references blithely tossed around by the team members show astounding erudition, and their speaking voices carry only the tiniest hint of an East Texas twang. 
For dramatic purposes the setting of the climactic debate has been changed in the movie to Harvard from the University of Southern California, where it actually took place. Again the issue is too neatly selected: nonviolent civil disobedience versus the rule of law. 
The wonder is that “The Great Debaters” transcends its own simplifying  and manipulative ploys; it radiates nobility of spirit. 
“The Great Debaters”  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and some strong language.

‽
‽Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street‽,‽Tim Burton makes fantasy movies. Stephen Sondheim writes musicals. It is hard to think of two more  optimistic genres of popular art, or of two popular artists who have so systematically subverted that optimism. Mr. Sondheim has always gravitated toward the dissonance lurking in hummable tunes, and has threaded his song-and-dance spectaculars with subtexts of anxiety and alienation. Mr. Burton, for his part, dwells most naturally (if somewhat uneasily) in the realms of the gothic and the grotesque, turning comic books and children’s tales into scary, nightmarish shadow plays. 
And so it should not be surprising that “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” Mr. Burton’s film adaptation of Mr. Sondheim’s musical, is as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the “Saw” franchise. Indeed, “Sweeney” is as much a horror film as a musical: It is cruel in its effects and radical in its misanthropy, expressing a breathtakingly, rigorously pessimistic view of human nature. It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme — I am tempted to say evil — genius. 
As it was originally performed onstage, with all the songs Mr. Sondheim composed for it, “Sweeney Todd” balanced its inherent grisliness with a whimsical vitality. The basic story is a revenger’s tragedy more Jacobean than Victorian, but Mr. Sondheim nonetheless wrings some grim, boisterous comedy out of both the impulse for vengeance and the bustling spirit of commerce. A barber, wronged by a powerful judge, returns to London and sets up shop, cutting throats as well as hair. The bodies of his victims are turned into savory meat pies by Mrs. Lovett, his energetic partner in business and crime. Cannibalism and mass murder as the basis for a hit show — what a perverse and delicious joke. 
It seemed a lot less funny in the recent revival, which starred Michael Cerveris and Patti Lupone in roles originated on Broadway by Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in 1979. Mr. Burton’s film, in spite of the participation of Sacha Baron Cohen (as a mountebank barber in a skin-tight costume) and Timothy Spall (as a louche bailiff) pretty much casts out frivolity altogether. Mr. Burton’s London is a dark, smoky oil slick of a city. Dante Ferretti’s production design, which owes something to the Victorian city confected for Carol Reed’s “Oliver!,” can make even daylight look sinister. Innocence, represented by a pair of young would-be lovers (Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower) has virtually no chance in this place; it is a joke played by fate, something to be corrupted, imprisoned or destroyed. 
Mrs. Lovett the pie maker is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a witchy fixture of Mr. Burton’s cinematic universe as well as the mother of his children. If the director has an alter ego, or at least an actor consistently able to embody his ideas on screen, it would have to be Johnny Depp. He was the hurt, misunderstood man-child in “Edward Scissorhands,” the cracked visionary in “Ed Wood” and the cold, creepy candy mogul in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” in each case giving  form to an emotional equation that had never quite been seen on film before. As Sweeney, his hair streaked with white and his eyes rimmed in black, he is an avatar of rage. 
Mr. Depp’s singing voice is harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful. He brings the unpolished urgency of rock ’n’ roll to an idiom accustomed to more refinement, and in doing so awakens the violence of Mr. Sondheim’s lyrics and melodies. Some of the crowd-pleasing numbers, like “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” have been pared away, but their absence only contributes to the diabolical coherence of the film, which moves with a furious momentum toward its sanguinary conclusion. 
Like nearly every other horror-film serial killer — the outcast teenager abused by the cool kids; the decent man whose suffering has been  ignored or mocked — Sweeney starts out as a sympathetic figure. Once upon a time, he was a happy husband and father, until his lovely wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) caught the eye of a malignant judge (Alan Rickman), who transported the poor barber to Australia. Now, after many years, he has returned to find that his daughter, now a teenager, has become the judge’s ward. Finding his old straight razors — “my friends” — under the floorboards of his former shop, Sweeney sets out to ensnare the judge, a project that requires the deaths of quite a few customers along the way. 
“They’ll never be missed,” sings the practical Mrs. Lovett. Sweeney’s view is harsher, almost genocidal. “They all deserve to die,” he says, looking out over the rooftops of the city. And Mr. Burton depicts those deaths ruthlessly. The initial geyser of blood may seem artificially bright, but when the bodies slide head first from the chair down a chute into the cellar, they crash and crumple with sickening literalness. You are watching human beings turned into meat. 
It may seem strange that I am praising a work of such unremitting savagery. I confess that I’m a little startled myself, but it’s been a long time since a movie gave me nightmares. And the unsettling power of “Sweeney Todd” comes above all from its bracing refusal of any sentimental consolation, from Mr. Burton’s willingness to push the most dreadful implications of the story to their blackest conclusions. 
“Sweeney Todd” is a fable about a world from which the possibility of justice has vanished, replaced on one hand by vain and arbitrary power, on the other by a righteous fury that quickly spirals into madness. There may be a suggestion of hopefulness near the end, but you don’t see hope on the screen. What you see is as dark as the grave. What you hear — some of the finest stage music of the past 40 years — is equally infernal, except that you might just as well call it heavenly. 
“Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It’s not “Hairspray.”

‽
‽Charlie Wilson's War‽,‽Most of the recent films we’ve seen about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us what a drag those conflicts are, which may be why so few of us have bothered to go see them. Of course all wars are terrible, but good movies have a way of mitigating that dreary fact even as they acknowledge it. Take the cold war: a “long twilight struggle” (as John F. Kennedy put it) that brought the world to the brink of annihilation and provided a persistent source of tension, anxiety and dread for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Horrible, to be sure. But also kind of a blast. 
That, at any rate, is pretty much the gist of “Charlie Wilson’s War,” which may be more of a hoot than any picture dealing with the bloody, protracted fight between the Soviet Army and the Afghan  mujahedeen has any right to be. As the film observes, that fight, in which the United States semi-secretly armed Muslim anti-imperialist  freedom fighters for much of the 1980s, was a prequel to later trouble with anti-Western Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and elsewhere. 
But let’s not get ahead of the story. Before the blowback, after all, a mighty blow for freedom was struck by a congressman with an alleged fondness for snorting blow. And let’s not be too quick to dismiss the wisdom of his sidekick, a C.I.A. operative with a bad temper and a worse haircut: “If you’re gonna do this, you might as well have fun with it.” 
Fun is this movie’s unlikely and persuasive motto. If it’s the best politically themed movie to come around in a while, that may be because the director, Mike Nichols, and the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, grasp that politics, for all its seriousness, is an essentially comic undertak- ing. Their film is never glib or flippant, but instead shows a lightness of touch and a swiftness of attack — 96 minutes to drink some cocktails, make some deals and send the Russians packing —  that stand in welcome contrast to the plodding, somber earnestness of some recent movies I will tactfully refrain from naming. 
Not that discretion is necessarily the better part of valor. And it’s hard to imagine a hero as indiscreet as Charlie Wilson, a Democrat who represented Texas’s Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. Mr. Wilson, who retired from the House in 1996, is played with sly, rascally charisma by Tom Hanks. It is always a pleasure to see Mr. Hanks play against clean-cut type, and here he has the devilish smile of a middle-aged playboy who has woken up in a long-lost guilt-free sequel to “Bachelor Party.” 
An unapologetic womanizer —  the type whose lechery seems like a higher form of gallantry — Wilson staffs his office with long-stemmed babes and casually seduces a pious constituent’s daughter (Emily Blunt). He’s a sharp political operator all the same, and also a man of conscience, as his patient, all-seeing assistant (Amy Adams) is pleased to discover. 
When we first encounter Wilson, he’s very much in his element: soaking in a Las Vegas hot tub with a Playboy model and a sleazy television producer, among others, his hand wrapped around a glass of Scotch and his mind focused on the consequences of Soviet aggression. God bless America! As understood by Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sorkin, who have filleted George Crile’s fascinating 500-page bestseller into a trim and lively history lesson, Wilson is both an anomaly and a paragon. 
A liberal as well as a libertine, he finds common cause (among other satisfactions) with Joanne Herring, a right-wing Houston socialite who loves Jesus and martinis and hates Communism. She is a splendid American contradiction, standing up for liberty and godliness while getting into bed (literally) with a bachelor congressman and (metaphorically) with President Zia  (Om Puri), the military ruler of Pakistan. 
Julia Roberts, as golden as an Oscar statue, incarnates Ms. Herring as if paying tribute at once to Barbara Stanwyck and to the legions of anonymous Julia Roberts impersonators toiling in drag clubs across the land. I mean this entirely as praise: Not many movie stars have the wit or the moxie to embrace the camp elements of their own personas, and the character is clearly something of a performer in her own right. 
The third player in this high-living, hard-partying jihad  is Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a C.I.A. operative whose first appearance in Charlie Wilson’s office sends the movie tipping, momentarily and deliciously, into pure door-slamming farce. Gust, whose Greek blood and rust-belt background make him something of a misfit among the blue bloods of the Agency, is as frustrated as Charlie is by the refusal of the United States to arm the Afghan resistance, and so the two of them cook up an elaborate scheme involving Israel, Pakistan, a belly dancer and a compliant House Subcommittee chairman (Ned Beatty). 
It’s quite a yarn, and the filmmakers relate it with clarity and verve. The film’s high spirits are inseparable from its sober purpose, which is to present a gentle corrective to the idea that American heroism resides only in square-jawed, melancholy stoicism. That has been the preferred post-9/11 stance, and there is some evident nostalgia in “Charlie Wilson’s War” for the simpler world of the 1980s, when the bad guys flew MIGs and American political life was perhaps a touch less sanctimonious. 
But there is nonetheless a bracing, cheering present-day moral to be found in Charlie Wilson’s story, a reminder that high principles are not incompatible with the pleasure principle. The good guys are the ones who know how to have a good time, and who counter the somber certainties of totalitarianism with the conviction that fun is woven into the fabric of freedom. 
“Charlie Wilson’s War” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, drug references and violence.

‽
‽Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story‽,‽“Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” has a good beat and you can dance to it, though mostly you’ll probably just tap your foot. It’s a cleverly packaged story about a patently phony musician — er, John C. Reilly is Dewey Cox — who conquers the nation’s eardrums with a song in his heart, a guitar in his hands and a million clichés in his DNA. He’s a tuneful pastiche: a little bit country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll, topped off with a pinch of Ray Charles, a dash of Buddy Holly and a whole mess of Johnny Cash as filtered through Joaquin Phoenix’s impersonation and mischievously repurposed through the Judd Apatow laugh factory. 
Mr. Apatow wrote the screenplay with the director Jake Kasdan, though given how close the two follow the recent biopic template some credit rightly belongs to the writers of “Ray” and “Walk the Line.” Like those films, “Walk Hard” tells an upbeat story about a great talent who finds renown, but also stumbles into temptation. “Ray” and “Walk the Line” are soft targets, near-parodies of the form, which suits this film just fine since Mr. Apatow and Mr. Kasdan have no plans to burn down the house. Dewey doesn’t shoot up backstage or beat his woman, much less drown in his vomit or hang himself in the family kitchen, as Ian Curtis does in “Control,” the downbeat version of the same old rock ’n’ roll story. 
Born to be mild, Dewey is cuddly and cute, not Iggy or pop. Partly as a consequence, the film is more funny ha-ha than LOL; it’s a smarty-pants satire that mocks and embraces almost every cliché in the biography playbook. The usual characters enter on cue, hitting their marks and the expected emotional notes, including Ma Cox (the wonderful Margo Martindale) and Pa Cox (Raymond J. Barry), who rear  Dewey in a shotgun shack not far from where Ray Charles played in the dirt before he grew up to become Jamie Foxx and win an Academy Award. Like Ray, Dewey is a musical prodigy, and it isn’t long before he’s making the girls swoon. But by then he’s become Buddy Holly with a child bride more befitting Jerry Lee Lewis. 
Mr. Kasdan is an observant student, and “Walk Hard” glitters with recycled biopic verisimilitude, from the cars to the clothes to the nagging first wife (Kristen Wiig) and especially the music. Written by a team of collaborators, the close to 20 songs jump from early rock ’n’ roll (“Take my ha-ha-hand”) to the Johnny Cash-style anthem of the film’s title and a genius Dylan-esque rune delivered in twanging singsong, in which “mailboxes drip like lampposts in the twisted birth canal of the coliseum,” “fairy teapots mask the temper tantrum/O’ say can you see ’em,” “stuffed cabbage is the darling of the Laundromat,” and 
The mouse with the overbite explained 
how the rabbits were ensnared 
’N the skinny scanty sylph trashed the apothecary diplomat 
Inside the three-eyed monkey within inches of his toaster-oven life. 
Dewey’s “Don’t Look Back” period takes place in the black-and-white 1960s familiar from D. A. Pennebaker’s documentary and now, of course, the Todd Haynes-Cate Blanchett take on that same period in “I’m Not There.” Mr. Kasdan shifts visual styles, or at least color schemes, as often as Dewey changes outfits. But despite the kaleidoscopic twirling, time traveling and a giddy visit with the Beatles in India, “Walk Hard” is surprisingly flat. Part of the problem is that it sticks so close to the films that inspired it that it actually echoes some of their flaws. The June Carter-Reese Witherspoon story in “Walk the Line” was pretty much a drag; the sendup in “Walk Hard,” which features Jenna Fischer as Darlene, is so accurate that it is too. 
The reliably enjoyable Mr. Reilly doesn’t bring any real modulation to Dewey or his phases, just good vibrations. He’s fun to hang around, even though I wish he and the film had made room for madness and not only faithful mimicry. Like all of Mr. Apatow’s films, “Walk Hard” is naughty, but it’s also awfully nice, a word that has no place in rock ’n’ roll. Maybe that’s why I kept waiting (hoping) for the Dewey Cox promised in the film’s poster, which shows Mr. Reilly — in homage to Jim Morrison — wearing only a necklace and a goofy, what-me-worry gape. He still looks more like Alfred E. Neuman than the Lizard King, true, but there he also seems on the actual verge of letting it all hang out. 
“Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.

‽
‽National Treasure: Book of Secrets‽,‽The hyperactive sequel “National Treasure: Book of Secrets” sends its archaeologist hero, Ben Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage, flexing his deadpan), on a globetrotting quest that might have been devised after a long night of Wikipedia surfing. 
Returning characters include Ben’s archaeologist daddy, Patrick Gates (the improbably dignified Jon Voight); Ben’s techie sidekick, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), who extricates Ben from impossible situations and serves up expository softballs; and Ben’s now-ex-girlfriend, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), whose dalliance with the press secretary (Ty Burrell) of the president of the United States enables the gang to hunt for clues in the Oval Office. 
New faces include Patrick’s ex-wife, Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), a scholar of ancient languages, who is sly and sexy even while translating pre-Columbian glyphs; and a rival archaeologist and Confederate sympathizer named Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), who brazenly accuses a Gates ancestor, Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch), of collaborating with Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth. 
Booth just happened to shoot Lincoln on the same night that he and a co-conspirator pressured Thomas Gates into translating a diary page that disclosed the location of Cibola, the fabled lost city of gold. To clear the Gates family name, the good guys must prove the existence of Cibola by finding the long-dispersed fragments of a map, one of which is hidden in a compendium of secrets handed down from president to president. 
To acquire the cleverly named Book of Secrets, Ben plots to kidnap the current president (Bruce Greenwood) and blah, blah, blah purple monkey dishwasher. 
Like its predecessor, “National Treasure,” this sequel amounts to a bunch of crossword puzzle answers stitched together with explosions, chases and displays of intuitive reasoning that the “Twin Peaks” F.B.I. agent Dale Cooper would reject as too right-brained. 
Granted, coherence and plausibility matter as much here as they did in the Indiana Jones films and “North by Northwest” (a film whose Mount Rushmore set piece “Book of Secrets” unwisely invokes). But Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock’s escapist pictures were more than time wasters. They offered dreamily intense predicaments, lived-in relationships (like Indy’s with his estranged father in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”), for which the prickly banter of Ben and Patrick is a pale substitute, and action scenes built from dynamic shots that interlocked like stained-glass window panels. 
As directed (covered, really) by Jon Turteltaub, the “National Treasure” films substitute trivia for poetry and busyness for thrills. The protracted climax of “Book of Secrets,” set in a dimly lighted, waterlogged Cibola (you thought they wouldn’t find it?), plays like a promotional reel for a forthcoming Disney World attraction. A London car chase that should be nerve-racking is merely noisy. 
The best one can say for this franchise is that almost every character is educated and proud of it. Even the brusque Parisian cops who interrupt Ben and Riley’s inspection of the Statue of Liberty in Paris can’t resist joining Ben in a discussion of the Baron de Montesquieu’s role in creating constitutional democracy. 
Such eccentricities are welcome, but they can’t approach memories of Indy outrunning a boulder and Eva Marie Saint dangling near George Washington’s face. 
“National Treasure: Book of Secrets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for bloodless violence and mild innuendo.

‽
‽P.S. I Love You‽,‽It would be easy to dismiss “P.S. I Love You,” about the agonies visited on a young married couple, as the big-screen equivalent of a paperback romance. Certainly the refined critical mind understands that this is the kind of artful emotion machine that the movies have been making since the very first tear slid down an actress’s face, the droplet seen — and experienced — around the world by audiences who answered that bead of dew with a grateful flood of their own. Cry us a river, Mary Pickford! 
Movies that make you bawl were sometimes called five-hankie weepies, a sneery label calculated to insult the film and the teary filmgoer alike. There aren’t a lot of these made anymore in America, mainly because most of our movies now are about men and not women. Even so, there are plenty of covert male weepies, films that transform emotions into actions, including acts of violence. “Michael Clayton” is a male weepy, as is “American Gangster,” which turns a duel between tough guys into a veritable drum circle of two. “P.S. I Love You” is more obviously a weepy, but because it leavens sorrow with laughter, it probably requires no more than three hankies. I wouldn’t know: I just used the back of my hand. 
The film stars Hilary Swank, a square-jawed beauty at once angular and bosomy, vaguely masculine and unequivocally feminine, whose greatest roles — in “Boys Don’t Cry” and in particular “Million Dollar Baby” — have exploited her ambiguous physicality to enormous advantage. Like some of the greatest sob sisters of the big screen — think of Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford — she has a kind of working-class toughness bordering on hardness that makes the eventual cracks in her armature all the more effective. Unlike Stanwyck and Crawford, though, Ms. Swank can come across as intensely, almost desperately eager to please, which invests her with tremulous pathos or makes you feel embarrassed on her behalf. Stanwyck would have booted her offscreen. Crawford would have eaten her for breakfast. 
Perhaps because of this masculine-feminine ambiguity, Ms. Swank has not often been cast as a romantic foil opposite men. She wooed another woman beautifully in “Boys Don’t Cry,” and in “Million Dollar Baby” played the adoring daughter to a surrogate father, a symbolic romance conducted principally inside the confines of a boxing ring. One reason she was so good in Brian De Palma’s convoluted noir “The Black Dahlia,” in which she crept around like poison ivy, is that her performance as a femme fatale is set inside quotation marks. She didn’t register as a toxically dangerous woman but as an idea of that irresistible sexist cliché. She filled out her character’s snug gown as  a drag queen would. 
“P.S. I Love You” looks squeaky clean and utterly straight and very much removed from the shadow worlds in which Ms. Swank has done her best work. Yet as directed by Richard LaGravenese, who shares screenwriting credit with Steven Rogers, it has a curious morbid quality. Ms. Swank plays Holly Kennedy, a 29-year-old New Yorker who, shortly after the story takes off, becomes a widow. Her husband, Gerry (Gerard Butler), however, doesn’t fully disappear. Instead he visibly lingers in her apartment — he seems less like a ghost than like a manifestation of mad grief  — and in the letters he left behind. These letters are full of bossy instructions for Holly on how to grieve and live. They are, in essence, a primer on how to be a widow. 
Mr. LaGravenese, who last directed Ms. Swank in the sympathetic drama “Freedom Writers,” is in sync with his star from the get-go. He puts her in the middle of the frame and in a succession of mostly flattering outfits, and smartly surrounds her with well-ripened second bananas, notably Kathy Bates, as Holly’s protective mother, and Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon, as her best friends. Harry Connick Jr. swings in and out as a possible love interest, as does the temperature-raiser Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a television actor (“Grey’s Anatomy,” “Weeds”) who bears a striking physical resemblance to Javier Bardem. Mr. Morgan’s appearance in “P. S. I Love You” finishes off Mr. Butler (last seen slaughtering Persians in “300”) far more effectively than does Gerry’s terminal illness. 
“P. S. I Love You” won’t win any awards; it isn’t the sort of work that flatters a critic’s taste. It’s preposterous in big and small matters (Holly complains about a Lower East Side apartment that any sane New Yorker would kill for), and there are several cringe-worthy set pieces, some involving Mr. Butler and a guitar. The film is not a beautiful object or a memorable cultural one, and yet it charms, however awkwardly. Ms. Swank’s ardent sincerity and naked emotionalism dovetail nicely with Mr. LaGravenese’s melodramatic excesses: Together the director and his star create a swell of feeling that helps blunt your reservations about being played as an easy mark, a sap or, worse, a girl, even if that’s exactly what you are. 
“P.S. I Love You” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Caution: this film may cause sniffles. 
‽
‽The District‽,‽The Hungarian cartoon feature “The District!” is a last-minute shoo-in for the title of 2007’s most original animated film, no small triumph in a year that also included  the releases of “Persepolis,” “Ratatouille,” “Beowulf” and “Paprika.” 
The movie is a sexually explicit, scabrously funny portrait of multiethnic European urban culture, similar to Ralph Bakshi’s early-1970s adults-only animated movies “Fritz the Cat” and “Heavy Traffic,” but richer and more coherent than either of those. It’s set in contemporary Budapest, where a group of streetwise Hungarian teenagers use a time machine (invented by their school’s resident nerd genius) to travel back to the prehistoric era and bury mammoths beneath what will eventually become their city’s streets. 
They plan to return to the present and drill those spots for oil, but that get-rich-quick scheme is complicated by the attentions of Vladimir V. Putin, Tony Blair and George W. Bush (who, in a bit of satire Michael Moore would enjoy, adds Hungary to his list of oil-rich nations worth attacking). 
Beyond goofy geopolitical riffing, “The District!” also offers a gangsta-flavored, surprisingly heartfelt update of “Romeo and Juliet” filled with loving directorial nods to “West Side Story” and Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing.” The cartoon’s trash-talking hero, Ricsi Lakatos, affiliated with a Gypsy street gang, hatches the time-travel plot, hoping to acquire enough money to win the beautiful but ethnically off-limits Julika Csorba, a Hungarian gang boss’s daughter. 
Their star-crossed romance and the social tension enfolding it are expressed in verbally acrobatic hip-hop numbers, envisioned by Aron Gauder, the director, with a mix of direct-address close-ups and anime-inspired combat poses, complete with blurred backgrounds. 
On top of its other considerable achievements, this is a dazzlingly assured piece of filmmaking. Merging seemingly hand-drawn, two-dimensional characters and deep-focus, intricately shadowed, simulated 3-D backdrops, “The District!” is like a dirty, thrilling pop-up book  you can step into. 
‽
‽The Singing Revolution‽,‽Can singing change history? “The Singing Revolution,” a documentary by James Tusty and Maureen Castle Tusty about Estonia’s struggle to end Soviet occupation, shows that it already has. 
The first part of “Revolution” provides a thumbnail  sketch of 20th-century Estonian history, and it’s not pretty. This small nation was a satellite state of the former Soviet Union for much of  that time, except for a brief period when the Germans controlled it. 
Under the Soviets, especially, Estonian culture was brutishly suppressed, but it welled up every five years in July, when Estonians gathered in Tallinn for the Estonian song festival, which often drew upward of 25,000 people. The  images  of these festivals  are moving already; the force of the singers and the precision of their conductors are stunning to behold. 
But the emotion swells further when Estonians defy their occupiers by singing nationalist songs. This bold act reclaimed Estonian identity and set the stage for a series of increasingly daring rebellions under the Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who advocated glasnost and got more than he bargained for. 
Imagine the scene in “Casablanca” in which the French patrons sing “La Marseillaise” in defiance of the Germans, then multiply its power by a factor of thousands, and you’ve only begun to imagine the force of “The Singing Revolution.”

After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Mamo (Ismail Ghaffari), a famed Kurdish musician living in Iran, gathers his many sons for a trip across the border to Iraqi Kurdistan and a long-planned celebratory concert. Despite failing health and his offspring’s fluctuating commitment to the dangerous enterprise, Mamo is resolute; neither callous border guards nor his own recurring premonitions of disaster will derail the performance. 
Fateful and funny, haunting and magical, “Half Moon” balances delicately between the harsh realities of its location and the mystical power of Mamo’s visions. Shooting mainly in Iranian Kurdistan, the cinematographers Nigel Bluck and Crighton Bone find an unearthly beauty amid the gambling frenzy of a cockfight and the silent ranks of exiled female singers lining the rooftops of a mountain village. As the end of the journey draws near, the line between the natural and the supernatural becomes increasingly difficult to discern. 
Inspired by Mozart’s “Requiem” and commissioned by the New Crowned Hope festival in Vienna, “Half Moon” is an affecting contemplation of resilience in the face of tragedy. When a higher purpose beckons, death itself must take a back seat.

‽
‽I Am Legend‽,‽“Not if you were the last man on earth!” Plenty of guys have heard that line at some point in their lives, but it’s unlikely that Will Smith is one. His irresistible charm has been proved, above all, by his ability to attract audiences to bad movies like “Hitch” and “Wild Wild West,” as well as to better ones like “Ali” and “The Pursuit of Happyness.” In spite of its third-act collapse into obviousness and sentimentality, “I Am Legend” — in which Mr. Smith plays somebody with every reason to believe that he really is the last man on earth — is among the better ones. 
And this star, whose amiability makes him easy to underestimate as an actor, deserves his share of the credit. There are not many performers who can make themselves interesting in isolation, without human supporting players. Tom Hanks did it in “Cast Away,” with only a volleyball as his buddy, foil and straight man. Mr. Smith has a few more companions, including an expressive German shepherd, some department store mannequins and a high-powered rifle. (There are also some flesh-eating, virus-crazed zombies, about which more in a moment.) But it is the charismatic force of his personality that makes his character’s radical solitude scary and fascinating, as well as strangely appealing. 
In this Mr. Smith is helped, and to some degree upstaged, by the island of Manhattan, which the movie’s director, Francis Lawrence, has turned into a post-apocalyptic wilderness. Three years after an epidemic has caused the evacuation and quarantine of New York City, Robert Neville (Mr. Smith) is its sole diurnal human resident, and he spends his days roaming its desolate neighborhoods, at once wary and carefree. The streetscapes he wanders through will be familiar to any visitor or resident, but the way Mr. Lawrence and his team of digital-effects artists have distressed and depopulated New York is downright uncanny. Weeds poke up through the streets, which are piled with abandoned cars, and a slow, visible process of decay has set in. 
A nightmare, of course, but not without its enchantments. In some ways Neville, dwelling in a highly developed urban space that is also a wilderness, experiences the best of both worlds. From his home base in the elegant Washington Square town house he was lucky enough to own (on a government employee’s salary) before the big die-off, he makes daylight forays that are like an adventure-tourist fantasy. He does a little deer hunting on Park Avenue and some indoor fishing at the Temple of Dendur, picks fresh corn in Central Park and smacks golf balls across the Hudson from the deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid. 
Mr. Lawrence, who previously directed the hectic, obnoxious “Constantine” and many music videos, uses elaborate, computer-assisted means to create simple, striking effects. While “I Am Legend,” the latest in a series of film versions of a novel by Richard Matheson, fits comfortably within the conventions of the sci-fi horror genre — here come those zombies! — it mixes dread and suspense with contemplative, almost pastoral moods. And without taking itself too seriously, the movie, written by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich, does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization. 
Neville, a scientist and a soldier, constitutes a civilization of one. His daily routines are at once practical — he wants to find a cure for the virus that wiped everyone else out, and he needs to be home before sundown — and spiritual. Under the streets of the city and in its empty buildings are the infected, transformed by the virus into pale, hairless, light-allergic cannibals. “Social de-evolution appears to be complete,” Neville observes as he makes notes in his basement lab. And his habits are a way not only of protecting himself from the zombies, but also of maintaining the distinction between them and him. 
The zombies, like the rabid dogs that are their companions, nonetheless display rudimentary pack behavior and are even able to set traps and make plans. Once they begin swarming, “I Am Legend” inevitably loses some of its haunting originality, since they look a lot like the monsters in “28 Days Later” (and its sequel, “28 Weeks Later”). They also represent a less compelling application of computer-generated imagery than all those empty avenues and silent buildings. 
And in its last section “I Am Legend” reverts to generic type, with chases and explosions and a redemptive softening of its bleak premise. The presence of the lovely Brazilian actress Alice Braga does seem promising; if she and Mr. Smith were to reboot the species together, Humanity 2.0 would be quite a bit sexier than the present version, as well as friendlier. But really the movie is best when its hero is on his own, and Mr. Smith, walking in the footsteps of Vincent Price and Charlton Heston, who played earlier versions of the Robert Neville character, outdoes both of them. There is something graceful and effortless about this performance, which not only shows what it might feel like to be the last man on earth, but also demonstrates what it is to be a movie star. 
“I Am Legend” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has virus-crazed, flesh-eating zombies.

‽Alvin and the Chipmunks‽,‽Hollywood continues its tired milking of old television properties with “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” a slick updating of the musical-cartoon franchise created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. in 1958. Remodeled over the years on television and recordings, the ’munks have been given a digital coat of paint this time out, but the movie doesn’t skimp — lasso those nostalgic parents! — on the memories of old. 
Jason Lee (doing a perfect “Alvin. Alvin! Alvin!”) plays David Seville, a rejected songwriter who meets the mischievous Alvin, brainy Simon and pudgy Theodore, transplanted tree dwellers who have raided his kitchen. When he discovers their unique vocal harmonies, he’s off to a record executive (a delightfully despicable, movie-stealing David Cross), who whisks the trio away to exploit their talent for all it’s worth. 
As fans of the television series know, Dave is the critters’ surrogate dad, and the film concerns his need to embrace that responsibility and save the boys from a showbiz life they’re too young for. The movie gets mileage out of the chestnuts “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late)” and “Witch Doctor” (you remember: “Oo-ee, oo-ah-ah, ting-tang, walla-walla, bing-bang”), its digs at the music industry and the cheap laughs of the big-beseeching-eye effect of Puss in Boots in the “Shrek” movies. 
But, alas, its animated protagonists are egregiously eclipsed by the live-action characters. Despite its shout-outs to the holiday season, this is essentially airplane fodder, not a perennial. Don’t hold your breath waiting for the sequel. 
“Alvin and the Chipmunks” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some mild rude humor. 
ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS

‽The Perfect Holiday‽,‽In “The Perfect Holiday” Nancy (Gabrielle Union), a divorced mother of two boys and a girl, glumly faces Christmas in New Jersey without a man in her life. Rubbing salt in her wounds is her ex-husband, J-Jizzy (Charlie  Murphy), a preening rap star with whom she is locked in a custody battle. Swathed in chinchilla, he is stymied on his current project, a Christmas album that includes gems like “I Love the Ho Ho Hos.” 
When Nancy’s daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), overhears Mom confiding to a friend that all she wants for Christmas is a compliment from a man, she passes along the wish to the handsome Santa at the local mall. In real life he is Benjamin (Morris Chestnut), a conveniently unmarried, struggling songwriter whose latest opus, a squishy mound of seasonal goo of the sort J-Jizzy could never write, reaches the rapper’s hands at an opportune moment. 
Benjamin, who noticed Nancy at the mall, takes Emily’s cue, tracks down the mother and delivers the requested compliment, then disappears. Nancy and her posse eventually find him, and romance blossoms. The only obstacle to happily-ever-after is Nancy’s older son, John-John (Malik Hammond), who takes an instant loathing to Benjamin. But the chances that Santa is Mr. Right are about as good as those of hearing “Jingle Bells” in a department store during the Christmas season. 
Santa and J-Jizzy each have comic sidekicks. Santa’s is Jamal (Faizon Love), a plus-size elf who, when called upon, has trouble squeezing into a Santa suit, and Jizzy’s is his exasperated manager, Delicious (Katt Williams).  Lurking on the sidelines are Queen Latifah as the unctuous Christmas angel who narrates the story, and Terrence Howard as her troublemaking opposite, Bah-Humbug. 
“The Perfect Holiday,” directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn’t believe in itself. The farcical contortions are stiff, the jokes flat, the romance half-baked, the acting rote and the familial bonhomie lukewarm. Watching the movie is like reaching into a Christmas stocking and pulling out handfuls of cheap plastic toys that are broken. 
“The Perfect Holiday”  is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some mildly off-color humor.

‽The Golden Compass‽,‽A fantastic bestiary inhabits “The Golden Compass,” prowling and flapping and slithering and fluttering. The animals, most of which are called daemons and are manifestations of the human soul, hover at the side of their people and near the story’s edge, where their coos and barks mix with the ambient clatter and clang. Every so often, an animal leaps forward, its fur raised in alarm, its feathers fanned in flight. And because these are no ordinary animals, they also offer words of comfort, advice, warning. In this otherworldly realm, humans have no dominion over these creatures, yet they are not merely equals, either. They are one. 
This beastly attitude and the conception of the soul as being somehow separate from its corporeal vessel are, as far as I can tell, the most irreligious conceits in the movie adaptation of “The Golden Compass,” a novel that was first published in Britain as  “Northern Lights.”  Written by Philip Pullman, it quickly became a critical and commercial success for the most obvious of reasons: It’s a charming romp set in a parallel universe stuffed with magical creatures, spooky villains and mythopoetic conceits, and propelled by a young  orphan, Lyra Belacqua, who embarks on the hero’s journey with her shape-shifting daemon, Pantalaimon (Pan for short). The book has attracted voluble criticism for equally obvious reasons: Its army of darkness is a totalitarian institution called “the Church.” 
That ecclesiastical entity is pretty much nowhere evident in the film, which otherwise hews as close to the original source as can be expected from a 114-minute, big-screen translation of a 400-or-so-page novel. Directed by the American Chris Weitz, who wrote the heavily condensed script, “The Golden Compass” has many of the virtues of a faithful screen adaptation and many of the predictable flaws. Agnostics and atheists may, for starters, regret the explicit absence of the Church (others may see lingering traces), but the movies have never been a particularly good pulpit for any gods other than those of cinema’s own creation. It’s a tradition that this film honors with a goddess of icy perfection played by the wickedly well-cast Nicole Kidman. 
As Mrs. Coulter, an emissary of the reigning powers (known only as “the Magisterium” in the film), Ms. Kidman has rarely looked more beautifully and exotically alien. When she first appears, she pours across the screen like liquid gold, her body provocatively shifting inside a shimmering, form-fitting gown, her gilt-blond hair and alabaster skin all but glowing. She’s the film’s most spectacular special effect (her wonderfully vicious little daemon-monkey runs a close second), and for once, the smooth planes of her face, untroubled by visible lines, serve the character. This masklike countenance  helps hide Mrs. Coulter’s malignant designs from Lyra (the newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, spunky and serviceable), who, not long after the story lifts off, falls into her care through a series of complicated developments. 
Mr. Weitz crams so many events, characters (computer-generated and otherwise), twists and turns, sumptuously appointed rooms and ethereally strange vistas into his film that he risks losing you in the whirl. It zips from the Gothic grandeur of Jordan College, the Oxford institution where Lyra has been raised and somewhat educated by her guardians (“Scholars”), to Mrs. Coulter’s swank London home, where the Art Deco touches bring to mind the dreamiest Astaire-and-Rogers cheek-to-cheek. Much like the neo-Victorian aristocrats in Neal Stephenson’s science-fiction novel “The Diamond Age,” the characters in “The Golden Compass” populate a world that resembles our own,  despite being also seductively foreign. In Lyra’s universe zeppelins putt-putt through a period twilight zone, evoking both a knowable past and a possible future. 
Despite the pit stops and lovely clutter, some of it visibly influenced by David Lynch’s “Dune,” the story unwinds in fairly straightforward fashion. Lyra, using a nifty, compasslike device called an alethiometer, must face danger and destiny, along with some hard truths. Among the hardest and headiest are those involving her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), an adventurer who dashes in and out of her life accompanied by an elegant snow leopard for a daemon. Aided and abetted by assorted quirky types and acting legends (Tom Courtenay in person, Ian McKellen in voice), Lyra follows Lord Asriel to the snowy north, where further perils await, along with a creepy intrigue involving stolen children and hints that the book’s two sequels are ready for their big-screen close-ups. 
The sequels are a welcome idea, if only because they might persuade Mr. Weitz and his team to take it slower next time. “The Golden Compass” is an honorable work and especially impressive, given the far smaller, more intimate scale of his last film as a director (with his brother, Paul), “About a Boy.”  But it’s hampered by its fealty to the book and its madly rushed pace, which forces you to dash through the story like Lord Asriel. 
Among other things, I would have liked to spend some quality time with Lyra’s friend and protector the warrior bear Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Mr. McKellen), a gorgeous creature whose ferocity is, alas, tempered by his resemblance to some familiar cuddly polar bears. It is, I discovered, hard to keep your mind off the concession stand when you are waiting for Iorek to offer Lyra a Coke. 
“The Golden Compass” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some intense scenes involve children in danger and warfare between bears and humans.

‽
‽Juno‽,‽Juno MacGuff, the title character of Jason Reitman’s new film, is 16 and pregnant, but “Juno” could not be further from the kind of hand-wringing, moralizing melodrama that such a condition might suggest. Juno, played by the poised, frighteningly talented Ellen Page, is too odd and too smart to be either a case study or the object of leering disapproval. She assesses her problem, and weighs her response to it, with disconcerting sang-froid. 
It’s not that Juno treats her pregnancy as a joke, but rather that in the sardonic spirit of the screenwriter, Diablo Cody, she can’t help finding humor in it. Tiny of frame and huge of belly, Juno utters wisecracks as if they were breathing exercises, referring to herself as “the cautionary whale.” 
At first her sarcasm is bracing and also a bit jarring — “Hello, I’d like to procure a hasty abortion,” she says when she calls  a women’s health clinic — but as “Juno” follows her from pregnancy test to delivery room (and hastily retreats from the prospect of abortion), it takes on surprising delicacy and emotional depth. The snappy one-liners are a brilliant distraction, Ms. Cody’s way of clearing your throat for the lump you’re likely to find there in the movie’s last scenes. 
The first time I saw “Juno,” I was shocked to find myself tearing up at the end, since I’d spent the first 15 minutes or so gnashing my teeth and checking my watch. The passive-aggressive pseudo-folk songs, the self-consciously clever dialogue, the generic, instantly mockable suburban setting — if you can find Sundance on a map, you’ll swear you’ve been here before. 
But “Juno” (which played at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals, not the one in Park City, Utah) respects the idiosyncrasies of its characters rather than exaggerating them or holding them up for ridicule. And like Juno herself, the film outgrows its own mannerisms and defenses, evolving from a coy, knowing farce into a heartfelt, serious comedy. 
A good deal of the credit for this goes to Ms. Page, a 20-year-old Canadian who is able to seem, in the space of a single scene, mature beyond her years and disarmingly childlike. The naïveté that peeks through her flippant, wised-up facade is essential, since part of the movie’s point is that Juno is not quite as smart or as capable as she thinks she is. 
It’s not simply that she has impulsive, unprotected sex with her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), or that she decides, against the advice of parents and friends, to have the baby and give it up for adoption. These, indeed, are choices she is prepared to defend and to live with. Rather, Juno’s immaturity resides in her familiar adolescent assumption that she understands the world better than her elders do, and that she can finesse the unintended consequences of her decisions. 
The grown-ups, at first, seem like familiar caricatures of adolescent-centered cinema: square, sad and clueless. But Juno’s father (J. K. Simmons) and step-mother (Allison Janney) turn out to be complicated, intelligent people, too, and not just because they are played by two of the best character actors around. Ms. Cody’s script and Mr. Reitman’s understated, observant direction allow the personalities of the characters to emerge slowly, and to change in credible and unpredictable ways. 
This is especially true of Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), the baby’s potential adoptive parents. The audience’s initial impression of them, like Juno’s, is of stereotypically smug yuppies trapped in rickety conventions of heterosexual domesticity. Vanessa is uptight and materialistic, while Mark tends the guttering flame of his youthful hipness, watching cult horror movies and trading alternative-rock mix CDs with Juno. 
Juno is, on the surface at least, a familiar type, surrounding herself with and expressing herself by means of kitschy consumer detritus (she calls the clinic on a hamburger phone) and pop cultural ephemera. She could be the hero of a Judd Apatow comedy (like, say, Mr. Cera, the boneless wonder of “Superbad” and a purely delightful presence here). Except, of course, that she’s female. Ms. Cody, Mr. Reitman and Ms. Page have conspired, intentionally or not, to produce a feminist, girl-powered rejoinder and complement to “Knocked Up.” Despite what most products of the Hollywood comedy boys’ club would have you believe,  it is possible to possess both a uterus and a sense of humor. 
“Juno” also shares with “Knocked Up” an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood. It follows its heroine — and by the end she has earned that title — on a twisty path toward responsibility and greater self-understanding. 
This is the course followed by most coming-of-age stories,  though not many  are so daring in their treatment of teenage pregnancy, which this film flirts with presenting not just as bearable but attractive. Kids, please! Heed the cautionary whale.  But in the meantime, have a good time at “Juno.” Bring your parents, too. 
“Juno” is,  somewhat remarkably,  rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations, obviously, but no nudity or violence and not much swearing.

‽We Pedal Uphill‽,‽Applying a microscope to 21st-century America, “We Pedal Uphill: Stories From the States 2001-2008” sees a country mired in paranoia, injustice and intolerance. 
Arranged in 13 fictional vignettes, each unfolding in a different state, the movie slides smoothly from racism in Tennessee to election fraud in Ohio, from corporate greed in Oklahoma to railroad chicanery in Nebraska. The performances are across-the-board solid (most of the cast is theater-based), and although the quality of the segments varies, the thoughtfulness of the writing (by Roland Tec, who also directs) does much to atone for the monochromatic palette and rudimentary camerawork. 
As a concerned overview of the post-Sept. 11 political landscape, “We Pedal Uphill” balances the heavy-handed (a liberal talk-radio host looking beneath his car for explosives) and the delicate (a camera tracking backward through an abandoned factory, while the voices of long-gone employees chatter eerily on the soundtrack). 
In the film’s most compelling story, a Massachusetts librarian discovers the perils of resisting the Patriot Act, and it’s well worth straining your eyes to see the title of the book she’s reading in the final scene. 
Neither self-righteous nor bombastic, these wide-ranging mini-tales coast on a gently insistent tone of regret. Without pointing fingers or naming names, Mr. Tec reminds us that change does not happen overnight.

‽Pageant‽,‽“Pageant” goes behind the scenes, dreams, breakdowns, freakouts, sequins, glitter and fabulous falsies of the Miss Gay America pageant, an annual competition for female impersonators who are every bit as dedicated (and hysterical) as mainstream beauty queens. 
And they are also, within the context of drag, just as traditional as their scepter-wielding sisters. Not for these divas the punk-inflected stylings you find on the cutting edge of the drag scene. This is female impersonation of the old school: lip-synching, Hollywood glamour, Liza, Judy and Fosse, Fosse, Fosse! 
This classicism is not without its charm, and it’s touching, in a goofy sort of way, to see how seriously everyone takes it. Directed by Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern, “Pageant” follows a manicured handful of fiercely committed drag masters with their eyes on the prize: a tiara, scepter, seven grand in cash and the priceless claim on bragging rights as America’s queen supreme. 
Supported by family, friends and leopard-print stilettos, the hopefuls primp and tuck and rehearse their routines en route to the 34th competition in Memphis. The location inspires one contestant to call for a moment of silence for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but for the most part the festivities are more in line with the pantomime by a plus-size diva (“Call me Pork Chop — everybody does!”) to an inevitable round of “And I Am Telling You.” Dream, girl, dream.

‽The Curious Case of Benjamin Button‽,‽“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” which occupies around 25 pages in the collected works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a slender piece of whimsy, a charming fantasy about a man who ages in reverse, descending through the years from newborn senescence to terminal infancy. As Fitzgerald unravels it, Benjamin’s story serves as the pretext for some amusing, fairly superficial observations about child rearing, undergraduate behavior and courtship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
From this odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source. “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” more than two and a half hours long, sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist’s condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald. 
While the film’s plot progresses, with a few divagations, in a straight line through the decades of Benjamin Button’s life, the backward vector of that biography turns this “Curious Case” into a genuine mystery. And the puzzles it invites us to contemplate — in consistently interesting, if not always dramatically satisfying ways — are deep and imposing, concerning the passage of time, the elusiveness of experience and the Janus-faced nature of love. 
Above all, though, “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is a triumph of technique. Building on the advances of pioneers like Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and Robert Zemeckis — and on his own previous work adapting newfangled means to traditional cinematic ends — Mr. Fincher (“Fight Club,” “Zodiac”) has added a dimension of delicacy and grace to digital filmmaking. While it stands on the shoulders of breakthroughs like “Minority Report,” “The Lord of the Rings” and “Forrest Gump” (for which Mr. Roth wrote the screenplay), “Benjamin Button” may be the most dazzling such hybrid yet, precisely because it is the subtlest. While he does treat the audience to a few grand, special-effect showpieces, Mr. Fincher concentrates his ingenuity on the setting and the characters, in particular — and most arrestingly — on the faces of his stars, Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt. 
Ms. Blanchett is Daisy, a dancer, bohemian and all-around free spirit who ages gracefully, before our eyes, into a stately modern matron and then into a wasted, breathless old woman. Mr. Pitt, for the most part, plays Benjamin, who is born, looking like a man in his 70s, into a prominent New Orleans family in 1918. I say for the most part because near the end of the movie Mr. Pitt is replaced by younger and younger children and also because, at the beginning, he is evoked by an uncanny computer-generated confection that seems to have been distilled from his essence. This creature, tiny and wizened, is at once boy and man, but in every scene the ratio is readjusted, until the strapping figure of a familiar movie star emerges, gradually and all but imperceptibly. 
The inner life of Benjamin Button, abandoned at birth by his stricken father (Jason Flemyng) and raised by the infinitely kind caretaker of a nursing home (Taraji P. Henson), is harder to grasp than his outer appearance, in part because Mr. Pitt seems more interested in the nuances of reticence than in the dynamics of expression. It’s true that Benjamin’s condition imposes a certain detachment: he is at once innocent and ancient, almost never who he appears to be. 
But even though Mr. Pitt’s coolness is a perfectly defensible approach to this character, his elusiveness, from one film to the next, is starting to look more defensive than daring. His recent performances have been devoted mainly to the study of his own magnetism, a quality he earnestly explores in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” and playfully subverts in “Burn After Reading.” It goes without saying that Mr. Pitt has charisma to burn, and he is a capable and inventive actor, but he will only be a great one if he risks breaking himself open on screen as he did, briefly, in “Babel.” 
And so, while Benjamin’s progress through life drives the narrative of “The Curious Case,” he is (as the title suggests) more an object of contemplation than a flesh-and-blood (or bit-and-byte) candidate for our empathy. His jaunt through the 20th century is certainly fun to watch, with an episodic rhythm that recalls old movie serials or, even more, the endlessly dilated adventures of newspaper comic-strip heroes. After some initiation into the pleasures of the flesh and the bottle in the city of his birth, Young Button (Old Button) hires onto a tramp steamer. He tarries a while in Russia, sampling caviar and adultery (with a superbly soignée Tilda Swinton) before World War II intrudes. 
Later there will be sailboats and motorcycles as the ambient light turns gold along with Mr. Pitt’s hair. There will not be much in the way of big events or public happenings — Benjamin Button is, finally, no Forrest Gump — and though he is a white Southerner raised by a black woman, he seems untouched by racial turmoil or by much of anything beyond the mysteries of his peculiar destiny. 
But the movie’s emotional center of gravity — the character who struggles and changes and feels — is Daisy, played by Ms. Blanchett from impetuous ingénue to near ghost with an almost otherworldly mixture of hauteur and heat. The story of Benjamin’s life is read to Daisy by her daughter (Julia Ormond) in a New Orleans hospital room in 2005, just as Hurricane Katrina is approaching the city. The imminence of the storm is a superfluous and unduly portentous device, since Katrina brings to mind precisely the hard, real-life miseries the movie has done everything in its power to avoid. 
That power, though, is something to be reckoned with, and it resides in Mr. Fincher’s ability to use his unbelievable skills to turn an incredible conceit into a plausible love story. The romance between Daisy and Benjamin begins when both are chronologically pre-adolescents and Benjamin is, physically, a codger, but the initial element of pedophilic creepiness in the relationship gives way to other forms of awkwardness. Their love is uniquely perfect and enduring. At the same time, like any other love — like any movie — it is shadowed by disappointment and fated to end. In the case of “Benjamin Button,” I was sorry when it was over and happy to have seen it. 
“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scenes of sex and violence.

‽
‽Valkyrie‽,‽There are no discernibly nasty Nazis in “Valkyrie,” though Hitler and Goebbels skulk about in a few scenes, shooting dark, ominous looks at the heroic German Army officer played by Tom Cruise. Perhaps they’re wondering what this Hollywood megastar is doing in their midst, a sentiment that you may come to share while watching Mr. Cruise  —  who gives a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor  —  strut about as one of history’s more enigmatic players. 
That enigma was Claus von Stauffenberg, a count and a colonel   who, though he lost one eye, an entire hand and several fingers while fighting on behalf of the Reich, made several attempts to assassinate Hitler and seize control of the government. At the core of  Stauffenberg’s spectacularly ambitious plot was Valkyrie,  Hitler’s plan  for the mobilization of the home army that  Stauffenberg hoped to hijack in order to quash the SS and its leaders.  It didn’t work, of course, for  complicated reasons, though also because by 1944, as William L. Shirer bluntly puts it in “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,” the conspirators were “terribly late.” 
You don’t learn how belated the  coup d’état was in “Valkyrie,” which might matter if  this  big-ticket production with Mr. Cruise in an eye patch and shiny, shiny boots had something to do with reality. But the director, Bryan Singer (of the “X-Men” franchise), and the writers, Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, aren’t interested in delivering a history lesson: that’s why Ken Burns was born. Slick, facile entertainment is the name of the game here, as it is in all Mr. Singer’s films, including “Apt Pupil” (about a Nazi war criminal and the American boy next door who outs him) and “The Usual Suspects,” an  intricately plotted story with men and guns, secrets and shadows that Mr. McQuarrie wrote. The secrets have already begun swirling by the time “Valkyrie” opens with Stauffenberg, stationed in North Africa, bitterly recording his opposition to Hitler in a diary right before losing various body parts to the war. After his convalescence he meets Maj. Gen.  Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), who, sometime earlier, tries to blow up Hitler with a bomb hidden in bottles of French liqueur. (Russian vodka might have been more effective.) Stauffenberg soon joins the conspiratorial party that includes other British class acts brandishing high military rank and speaking in lightly accented or unaccented English: Bill Nighy as Gen.  Friedrich Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm, Terence Stamp as Gen.  Ludwig Beck and Eddie Izzard as Gen. Erich Fellgiebel. 
Most of the crucial rebellious officers are played by British actors, while some of the Nazi diehards are played by Germans, which wouldn’t be worth mentioning if this cacophony of accents weren’t so distracting. But, as with the casting of Mr. Cruise, whose German voice-over quickly eases into English, this international acting community invokes an earlier studio age, when Peter Lorre and Claude Rains delivered their lines in exotically flavored English and everyone pretended that Rick’s Cafe really was located in Casablanca and not on a back lot. If Mr. Cruise doesn’t work in “Valkyrie,” it’s partly because he’s too modern, too American and way too Tom Cruise to make sense in the role, but also because what passes for movie realism keeps changing, sometimes faster than even a star can change his brand. 
Though Mr. Singer’s old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily. Hitler (David Bamber) doesn’t need spooky music or low camera angles to be villainous: he just has to show up. Mr. Singer’s fondness for exaggeration can even undercut his strongest scenes, as when Stauffenberg visits Hitler to secure approval for the rewritten Valkyrie plan. If implemented, the plan will bring down the Führer who, for his part, seems intent on bringing down the house with leers and popping eyeballs. Mr. Singer appears to have taken cues here from “Black Book,” Paul Verhoeven’s World War II romp, but he’s too serious to make such vaudeville work. 
Stauffenberg, who hated Hitler but worshipped the Reich, sacrificed himself on the dual altar of nationalism and militarism, which makes him a more ambiguous figure than the one drawn in “Valkyrie.” He’s a complex character, too complex for this film, which like many stories of this type, transforms World War II into a boy’s adventure with dashing heroes, miles of black leather and crane shots of German troops in lockstep formation that would make Leni Riefenstahl flutter. It’s a war that offers moral absolutes (Nazis are evil) and narratives (Nazis are evil and should die) that seem easier to grasp than any current conflict. Truly, World War II has become the moviemaker’s gift that keeps on giving, whether you want it to or not. 
“Valkyrie” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Bombs, guns and executions, though little blood.

‽
‽The Spirit‽,‽Out in the blogosphere you frequently run across invocations of Godwin’s Law, which can be paraphrased as stating that sooner or later every argument will come around to a Hitler analogy. A similar axiom, applied to Hollywood, would stipulate that every movie star must eventually dress up in a German war uniform. 
This is not the review of “Valkyrie,” by the way, a film that upholds this rule with respect to the special case of Tom Cruise. I’m just trying to figure out why, somewhere in the middle of “The Spirit,” Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson arrive on screen decked out in swastikas and jackboots. Nothing in the logic of the film explains it, but then, to use the phrase “the logic of the film” when talking about “The Spirit” may be to take the “oxy” out of “oxymoronic.” 
To ask why anything happens in Frank Miller’s sludgy, hyper-stylized adaptation of a fabled comic book series by Will Eisner may be an exercise in futility. The only halfway interesting question is why the thing exists at all. The most plausible answer lies in its pedigree. Eisner, who died in 2005, is worshiped by aficionados of what he called “sequential art” for his graphic brio, literary flair and naughty wit. For his part Mr. Miller occupies a special spot in the modern geek pantheon as the author of high-gloss comics and graphic novels like “Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,” “Sin City” and “300.” 
Though he was involved in the film adaptations of “300” and “Sin City,” “The Spirit” marks Mr. Miller’s first solo effort as a director, and his bold visual style is not well served by his clumsiness as a cinematic storyteller. The movie seems to be trying to combine a knowing, winking sense of pop-culture history with an embrace of the more soulful aspects of that history, but the result is a talky, pretentious stew of film noir poses and crime-fighter clichés. 
Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johansson at least seem to enjoy themselves, which is their prerogative since they are the villains. Gabriel Macht, who plays the fedora-wearing, skirt-chasing, undead hero (a former policeman brought mysteriously back to life as a vigilante), works hard to give off an air of hard-boiled insouciance. Unfortunately whatever natural charisma he may possess is disguised by his  hat, his mask and the murky shadows of the mise-en-scène. 
What is most striking about “The Spirit” is how little pleasure it affords, in spite of its efforts to be sly, sexy, heartfelt and clever all at once. Or perhaps the movie flounders because its multiple ambitions are fundamentally at odds, like the various femmes, fatale and otherwise, who do battle for the hero’s heart. 
The 108 overstuffed, interminable minutes of “The Spirit” yield exactly two memorable moments: when one of Mr. Jackson’s genetically engineered minions (all played by Louis Lombardi) appears as a tiny, hopping foot with a head grafted on to it, supplying an odd, creepy morsel of Surrealism; and when Eva Mendes, playing a character called Sand Saref, sits on a copy machine and presses the button. She produces what may be the only true-to-life image in the movie, as well as the most interesting. 
“The Spirit” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its intense brutality is carefully edited and shaded to emphasize its fantastical nature. 
THE SPIRIT 
Opens on Thursday nationwide.  
Written and directed by Frank Miller, based on the comic book series by Will Eisner; director of photography, Bill Pope; edited by Gregory Nussbaum; music by David Newman; art director, Rosario Provenza; produced by Deborah Del Prete, Gigi Pritzker and Michael E.

WITH: Gabriel Macht (the Spirit), Eva Mendes (Sand Saref), Sarah Paulson (Ellen), Dan Lauria (Dolan), Paz Vega (Plaster of Paris), Eric Balfour (Mahmoud), Jaime King (Lorelei), Scarlett Johansson (Silken Floss),  Samuel L. Jackson (the Octopus) and Louis Lombardi (Phobos). 
‽
‽Bedtime Stories‽,‽Adam Sandler is at that difficult age. Now 42, he’s too old to continue with the bungling, man-child shtick of yore, yet too young to transition to old-fogey infantilism. In “Bedtime Stories” the pain of this artistic limbo is written all over his character, a resentful hotel handyman named Skeeter. Astonishingly, his name is not the source of his umbrage. 
Skeeter’s pique (though he may not know it) is reserved for his dead father, an inept businessman whose cozy motel once occupied the lot where Skeeter’s current employer has erected an upscale resort. Gone, along with the homespun vibe, is Skeeter’s dream of one day running the property; so when his divorced sister, Wendy (a frighteningly taut Courteney Cox), asks him to baby-sit for his young niece and nephew (Laura Ann Kesling and Jonathan Morgan Heit) for a few days, Skeeter is in no mood to play scallywag uncle. 
“I don’t believe in happy endings,” he tells his incredulous charges when story time comes around. Luckily for the tykes, their director, Adam Shankman, loves them, the happier the better. (Even as a guest judge on “So You Think You Can Dance” Mr. Shankman, a popular choreographer, squirmed mightily to avoid delivering a bad critique.) 
Rolling up his sleeves and piling on the digital effects, he labors to whip life into a screenplay (by Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy) so tired even Bugsy, the children’s pop-eyed guinea pig, is moved to tuck himself into bed. 
But Mr. Shankman is not one to give up without a fight. And as the children concoct their own stories, Skeeter and the rest of the cast are dragged through a variety of threadbare fantasies — an Old West showdown, a medieval joust, a chariot race in ancient Greece — in which Skeeter inevitably bests the villain and bags the girl. The adorable Keri Russell, as the unfortunate target of Skeeter’s passive-aggressive affections, is the movie’s soft center and sole pleasure: a locus of calm in a sea of turmoil. 
Faring less well are performers whose tenure in children’s entertainment will, I hope, be brief, including Lucy Lawless as a brittle desk clerk and Russell Brand as Skeeter’s fuzzily written best friend. And if there were an Oscar for miscasting, Guy Pearce’s atrocious turn as the hotel’s pompous manager would be a lock. Mugging beneath a horrendous coif, he makes Basil Fawlty look like a paragon of restraint. 
Almost everyone leaves blood on the floor, but “Bedtime Stories” refuses to be juiced; soured by its enervated star and uninspired writing, the movie offers only tiny moments of joy, like a hailstorm of gumballs that’s unexpectedly magical. 
Clearly, pushing Skeeter’s broom doesn’t agree with Mr. Sandler, who seems impatient with immaturity and anxious to grow up. He was much happier selling novelty toilet plungers in “Punch-Drunk Love,” but the director of that movie, Paul Thomas Anderson, recognized his star’s natural inner rage and how to tap into it, encouraging a revelatory performance unlike anything on his résumé. 
If Mr. Sandler hopes to shift smoothly into more mature roles (as indicated by last year’s “Reign Over Me”), he needs directors who understand his uncommon gifts. The toilet plungers are optional. 
“Bedtime Stories” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). Stampeding horses, angry dwarves and a Booger Monster.  
BEDTIME STORIES 
Opens on Thursday nationwide.  
Directed by Adam Shankman; written by Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy, based on a story by Mr. Lopez; director of photography, Michael Barrett; edited by Tom Costain and Michael Tronick; music by Rupert Gregson-Williams; production designer, Linda Descenna; produced by Andrew Gunn, Adam Sandler and Jack Giarraputo; released by Walt Disney Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes. 
WITH: Adam Sandler (Skeeter Bronson), Keri Russell (Jill), Guy Pearce (Kendall), Russell Brand (Mickey), Richard Griffiths (Barry Nottingham), Jonathan Pryce (Marty Bronson), Courteney Cox (Wendy), Lucy Lawless (Aspen), Laura Ann Kesling (Bobbi), Jonathan Morgan Heit (Patrick), Teresa Palmer (Violet Nottingham) and Aisha Tyler (Donna Hynde). 
‽
‽Yes Man‽,‽At the beginning of “Yes Man,” Carl Allen is a grouch, a curmudgeon, a wet blanket.  His relentless negativity — his job as a loan officer provides him with plenty of opportunities to say no  — is less a matter of temperament than of circumstance: apparently Carl never recovered from the breakup of his marriage. But then a visit to a self-help seminar led by a guru (Terence Stamp) who preaches the power of yes transforms Carl into a wild, unpredictable fellow, a giddy, spontaneous goofball, a gangling, motormouthed, rubber-faced id. In short, Carl turns into Jim Carrey. 
But “Yes Man,” dutifully directed by Peyton Reed (“Bring  It On,” “Down With Love”) is too sluggish and slapdash a vehicle for its star’s prodigious wackiness. The movie’s premise is not far from that of “Liar Liar,” one of Mr. Carrey’s biggest hits of the mid-’90s, in which he played a chronic dissembler suddenly compelled to tell the truth. That film was a philosophical tour de force compared  with  this one, which arrives at the startling conclusion that while saying no to everything is bad, saying yes to everything is not ideal either. 
Most of us learned at least a rudimentary version of this lesson around the age of  5, and one of the many problems with “Yes Man” is that it is insufficiently infantile. Mr. Carrey looks too grown up, too tired to plunge into the reckless silliness that the story demands, and the story doesn’t really demand enough of it. Once Carl has banished no from his vocabulary, what does he say yes to? Flying lessons. A class in conversational Korean. Every loan application that crosses his desk. 
That last bit has a somewhat unpleasant, if inadvertent, topical resonance, but never mind that. Some of the things Carl does are a bit wilder than learning to play the guitar. He accepts a sexual proposition from an elderly neighbor, which leads to a gag that was already tired when it popped up in “Soul Men” a few months ago. He wraps his head in cellophane tape. He goes on a Red Bull binge. He provokes a fight in a bar after snorting some Tabasco sauce. 
And he falls in love with a pale-eyed, mildly eccentric cutie named Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel, who took on similar waif duties opposite Will Ferrell in “Elf.” The role of Mr. Carrey’s romantic counterpart is never an easy one, given his manic energy and the childish narcissism that is the basis of his shtick. Only Kate Winslet, engaging with a more subdued incarnation of Mr. Carrey in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” has been able to distract him from himself. Ms. Deschanel never really has a chance, and instead functions as a kind of sidekick, breezing through some semi-funny set pieces on the way to an obligatory smiley-teary ending. 
Mr. Carrey has some good moments, as do a few of the supporting performers, notably Bradley Cooper as Carl’s best friend and Rhys Darby as his socially maladroit boss. But “Yes Man” rarely rises to genuine hilarity. It takes no risks, finds no inspiration and settles, like its hero, into a dull, noncommittal middle ground. Should you see this movie? Maybe. Whatever. I don’t care. 
“Yes Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing, sexual references and brief nudity. 
‽
‽The Tale of Despereaux‽,‽Once upon a time there was a charming tale of a wee little mouse with wide-open eyes and ears as large as saucers. Named Despereaux Tilling, the mouse grew up, though not by much, to become a reader of books and the besotted friend of a lovely human princess named Pea. In time he saved the day, battling an army of rats, and won the hearts of millions of readers and eventually a contract with a Hollywood studio. This is how the book “The Tale of Despereaux: Being  the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup, and a Spool of Thread” became a computer-animated movie, though without the rambling subtitle and as many eccentricities. 
Being  a Hollywood story of a mouse, a princess, some soup and thread — not to mention rats, hats and a girl named Mig  with the unfortunate looks of a pig — the movie “The Tale of Despereaux” offers up other changes too. It begins as all fairy tales should, with a narrator (an efficient, somewhat cool-sounding Sigourney Weaver) recounting the story of the pastel-hued Kingdom of Dor, where the peasants were content, the rulers were just,  and the rats scuttled about unmolested. The balm for this peaceable kingdom was soup, a fragrant broth that flowed out of the royal kitchen and into the waiting bowls of the populace. But good times turned to bad when a rat named Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) fell into the queen’s soup, producing a fatal reaction. 
Directed by Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen and written by Gary Ross (who also served as one of the producers), “Despereaux” is a pleasantly immersive, beautifully animated, occasionally sleepy tale. Like most American animated movies, it centers on a plucky hero (softly voiced by Matthew Broderick) who, against the nominal odds (though, really, the odds are always stacked in his favor), overcomes adversity of some kind. 
As in Kate DiCamillo’s enchanting, Newbery Medal-winning book, Despereaux has to triumph over both his home life (he’s far too bold for the other mice) and the forces of darkness shrouding Dor. What’s particularly sweet about his journey is that it begins with a book he was supposed to nibble, not read. 
Reading transforms Despereaux, turning a bold little mouse into a great big hero —  a wonderful moral for any children’s book. The story he reads is a fairy tale about a sad princess and a brave knight, an adventure that periodically springs to expressive life because Despereaux doesn’t merely read this tale, he visualizes it so we see it too. 
Animated in a more graphically bold style than the rest of the movie, the fairy tale becomes a story within a story. And in one clever scene, which finds the mouse describing the exploits of the knight and the princess to a separate character, the fairy tale plays on the wall next to him as if it were being projected like a movie. 
It doesn’t take long for Despereaux to experience the dangerous lows and exultant highs of a knight’s quest. Like many other misunderstood heroes, he suffers for his specialness, which in this case finds him banished from Mouseworld, an orderly Lilliput, to Ratworld, a menacing purgatory filled with bones and introduced with a flourish of Middle Eastern flute  music. (The casbah vibe thankfully fades fast.) 
There he meets Roscuro, and together they embark on the road to redemption,  with justice and a happily ever after for all, including the princess (Emma Watson) and Mig (Tracey Ullman), a peasant whose porcine qualities suggest that ugliness is destiny. But “The Tale of Despereaux” is on the side of kindness, not cruelty, and it encourages smiles if not the book’s flights of fancy. 
The movie has a fine sense of pictorial detail — the mouse’s delicate whiskers, the images of soup ladles carved into the palace stairs — and an agreeable gentleness. It deviates from its source material in generally modest and unobtrusive ways; for instance, by reorganizing the book’s fragmented, parallel story lines into a linear whole. 
The main difference between the source and its adaptation is that while the book exudes charm, the movie leans toward cute, a substitution that largely speaks to the influence of Disney on animation. In the movie Despereaux wears a red cap that makes him look more like a well-dressed bunny than like a mouse. But at least he’s not wearing Mickey’s gold clodhoppers and bottom-line grin. 
“The Tale of Despereaux” is rated G (General audiences). Some children and city-raised adults might find all the hungry, scurrying rats a bit (or very) creepy.

‽
‽Seven Pounds‽,‽“Seven Pounds,” which reunites Will Smith with Gabriele Muccino (who directed him in “The Pursuit of Happyness”), begins with a series of riddling, chronologically scrambled scenes. A man calls 911 to report his own suicide. He badgers a blind call-center employee — whom we suspect will be a significant character, since he’s played by Woody Harrelson — with complaints and insults. He embraces a lovely woman in an even lovelier beach house. He visits a nursing home where he terrorizes an administrator and comforts a resident. 
For a while it is pleasant enough to contemplate these loose ends, and to tease from them the possible contours of a story. It is never unpleasant to watch Mr. Smith, who likes to play peekaboo with his charm, hiding it now and then behind fleeting shadows of anguish or malice. The music (Angelo Milli’s score and a handful of emotive pop songs) combines with the deep colors of Philippe Le Sourd’s cinematography to summon up intensities of sentiment not yet arrived at by the narrative, creating an interesting frisson of suspense. After a while, though, as the pieces of the puzzle snap together, curiosity gives way to incredulity. 
Near the end of “Seven Pounds” a carefully laminated piece of paper appears, on which someone has written, “DO NOT TOUCH THE JELLYFISH.”  I wouldn’t dream of it, and I’ll take the message as a warning not to divulge the astonishing things that happen, not all of them involving aquatic creatures. 
Frankly, though, I don’t see how any review could really spoil what may be among the most transcendently, eye-poppingly, call-your-friend-ranting-in-the-middle-of-the-night-just-to-go-over-it-one-more-time crazily awful motion pictures ever made. I would tell you to go out and see it for yourself, but you might take that as a recommendation rather than a plea for corroboration. Did I really see what I thought I saw? 
And I wish I could spell out just what that was, but you wouldn’t believe me, and the people at Sony might not invite me to any more screenings. So instead of spelling out what happens in “Seven Pounds,” I’ll just pluck a few key words and phrases from my notes, and arrange them in the kind of artful disorder Mr. Muccino seems to favor (feel free to start crying any time): 
Eggplant parmesan. Printing press. Lung. Bone marrow. Eye transplant. Rosario Dawson. Great Dane. Banana peel. Jellyfish (but you knew that already). Car accident. Congestive heart failure. 
Huh? What the ... ? Hang on. What’s he doing? Why? Who does he think he is? Jesus! That last, by the way, is not an exclamation of shock but rather an answer to the preceding question, posed with reference to Mr. Smith. Lately he has taken so eagerly to roles predicated on heroism and world-saving self-sacrifice — see “I Am Legend” and “Hancock” — that you may wonder if he has a messiah clause in his contract. Which is not to say that he doesn’t show range in these films, in which he credibly plays a research scientist, a dissolute superhero and, in this latest one, an I.R.S. agent. 
An I.R.S. agent who wants only to help people. This is a nice, small joke that provides a few grace notes of levity in what is otherwise a lugubrious exercise in spiritual bushwa.  For all its pious, earnest air, “Seven Pounds” cries out to be remade as an Asian horror movie, so that the deep, creepy grotesqueness of its governing premise might be allowed to flourish, rather than to fester beneath the surface. 
As it is, the movie is basically an inverted, twisted tale of revenge. Ben Thomas, Mr. Smith’s character, is in essence a benevolent vigilante, harassing, stalking and spying on unsuspecting citizens for their own good, and also to punish himself. Why such misery should also be inflicted on an innocent, affirmation-hungry audience — and also on the marvelous Ms. Dawson, who plays one of Ben’s victim-beneficiaries — is another matter entirely. 
But maybe I’m approaching this in the wrong way. Maybe “Seven Pounds” isn’t a spiritual parable about redemption or forgiveness or salvation or whatever, but rather a collection of practical lessons. Don’t drive while using a BlackBerry. Fertilize your rose bushes with banana peels — sorry, that was a spoiler. But please, whatever you do, don’t touch the jellyfish. 
I’m serious. Don’t. 
“Seven Pounds” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Swearing. Soulful sex by candlelight. Car  accident. Eggplant parmesan.

‽Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi‽,‽In the last few years Hindi films have become slicker and faster, full of dizzying camera moves and blink-and-you’ll-miss-it editing. The technical exuberance is almost always impressive, but it’s starting to seem like its own cliché. 
How refreshing, then, to settle into “Rab Ne Bana di Jodi” (“A Match Made by God”), a love story   that has a different pace and feel than the recent crop of action thrillers. “Rab,” which reteams the director Aditya Chopra and Shahrukh Khan, Bollywood’s reigning superstar, is “soft, sweet and slow,” in the words of one of its songs. It deftly blends comedy,  the ruling tone of the new Bollywood, with melodrama, the ruling tone of the old. 
Mr. Khan sports glasses and a cheesy little mustache as Surinder Sahni, a shy self-described geek who works for Punjab Power in Amritsar. Surinder is gaga for his wife, Taani (the newcomer Anushka Sharma), who, because of various tragedies in the film’s first few minutes, may have lost the ability to love or be happy. 
To win Taani’s heart — or just to see her smile — Surinder gets an extreme makeover and disguises himself as Raj, a swaggering goofball who favors tight jeans and T-shirts with slogans like “Bad Boy.” Raj becomes Taani’s partner in a dance competition (“First time in Amritsar!”), and boy meets girl all over again. 
Mr. Chopra’s 1995 film, “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” starring Mr. Khan, remains a touchstone of contemporary  Bollywood, and the two do excellent work again here.   The Surinder/Raj dual role seems tailor-made (probably was) for Mr. Khan, who gets to show off his twin talents: he suffers nobly and entertains with panache. And Mr. Chopra demonstrates how a director can master technology without being mastered by it. For him, storytelling comes first. (The plot has its flaws, but they’re not deadly.) 
“Rab” is suffused with God talk and movie talk; religion and films are how the characters learn lessons about life and love. The best and most joyous sequence here is a song-and-dance number that pays witty tribute to Bollywood and Hollywood styles through the decades. It’s a lesson that goes down easy.

‽The Day the Earth Stood Still‽,‽Long after we are gone, science fiction movies about our impending extinction will instruct whoever comes next that we were a strange, neurotic species indeed. We could not — cannot — get enough of fantasies of destruction, meant at once to inflame and soothe our fear of vanishing altogether, whether through war, ecological catastrophe, disease or alien invasion. 
We know we have it coming, and a movie like “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” either in its 1951 version or in the “reimagining” that opens Friday, invites us to feel fleetingly bad about that even as we are encouraged to laugh it off. The laughter — at the earnest reckoning occasioned by a weary-looking extraterrestrial and his giant robot; at the panic and distress their visit provokes — serves as a necessary balm. Like other overwhelming emotions, the fear of apocalypse becomes more palatable when it is turned into camp. 
The old “Day,” made early in the atomic age, has long inspired this kind of laughter. It has also, in part because of its expressive, shadowy black-and-white cinematography, retained a measure of haunting, unsettling weirdness. 
Any hope that the new “Day,” directed by Scott Derrickson from a script by David Scarpa, might also someday rise above its pulpy, corny, somber silliness rests mainly on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves. Those shoulders are perfect for filling out a dark, narrow suit, just as Mr. Reeves’s deadpan basso and permanently perplexed features make him an ideal Klaatu, as the space visitor is called. Klaatu’s job is to assist, calmly and methodically, in the extermination of the human race, a task he tries, with evident fatigue, to explain to his hysterical, violent would-be victims. 
Only one will listen:  Dr. Helen Benson, played with a bit too much ennui by Jennifer Connelly. Helen, an expert in astrobiology, is part of a team of scientists taken into government custody by force when a giant orb seems about to crash into the Earth. Instead it lands in Central Park, disgorging that giant metal Cyclops robot (a near replica of the one from the earlier movie) and poor Klaatu. 
The secretary of defense (Kathy Bates, with Hillary Clinton’s demeanor and Sarah Palin’s hair) responds with military force, which only speeds the process of humanity’s annihilation and demonstrates that our executioners may have a point. We’re such a brutal, dumb, incorrigible life form that the only way the planet can survive is if we’re no longer on it. (In 1951 the case against us was mainly pacifist. Now the anti-militarism has a more urgent and explicit ecological dimension.) A metastasizing swarm of metal bugs — the best special effects in a movie that often looks cheap and bedraggled — is dispatched to eat us and everything we’ve made, or at least everything on the New Jersey Turnpike. 
But wait, Helen pleads. We can change! To provide evidence of this transformative potential she takes Klaatu to see her mentor,  Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese), a scientist who listens to Bach and was awarded a Nobel Prize for “altruistic biology.” Apparently this is the Swedish Academy’s euphemism for pimping: the good doctor’s advice to Helen about how to approach Klaatu is to “persuade him not with your reason, but with yourself.” 
Still, any movie that awards a former Monty Python cast member a Nobel Prize in anything cannot be all bad. And “The Day the Earth Stood Still” could be worse. Its scenario and many of its scenes feel ripped off rather than freshly imagined — why do aliens always seem to end up in New Jersey? — and the relationship between Helen and her stepson, Jacob (Jaden Smith), does not quite add the necessary element of heart-tugging sentiment. 
After “Wall-E” and “I  Am Legend” and the dozens of apocalypse flicks since the last “Day the Earth Stood Still” we can surely do better. Even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, much as he did back when we knew him as Neo. 
“The Day the Earth Stood Still” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). We’re doomed!

‽Nothing Like the Holidays‽,‽The gnarly dead tree in front of the Rodriguez house in Humboldt Park, a working-class Latino neighborhood of Chicago, will not be processed into kindling. As the Rodriguez menfolk, gathered for Christmas, attack it with chain saws, their incompetence with power tools makes them look like fools. Even when they try to drag it out of the earth with ropes and chains attached to a car, it refuses to budge. 
That old dead tree is an unwieldy metaphor for family solidarity in “Nothing Like the Holidays,” an efficient home-for-Christmas ensemble comedy trimmed with plastic teardrops. But the tree might also stand for a wooden holiday genre in which uplift follows tumult as surely as Christmas morning follows Christmas Eve. The only distinguishing characteristic of this mildly agreeable variation of a worn-out formula is that the boisterous family under examination is Puerto Rican, and the screenplay includes a smattering of Spanish. 
In its early scenes the movie, which has as many underdeveloped subplots as characters, threatens to be another melodrama about a returning soldier.  The glum Jesse (Freddy  Rodriguez), home from Iraq, is picked up at the airport by his neighborhood pals; sunglasses cover deep scratches around one eye that suggest he has had a set-to with a riled-up house cat. 
But “Nothing Like the Holidays,” directed by Alfredo de Villa (“Washington Heights”) from a screenplay by Alison Swan and Rick Najera, has neither the time nor the inclination to explore Jesse’s malaise in any depth. Although he harbors guilt about the death of a friend in combat, what really bugs him is that Marissa (Melonie Diaz), the girlfriend he dumped, has happily settled down with another man. 
No sooner has the Rodriguez clan gathered around the dinner table than the mother, Anna (Elizabeth Peña, who is at least a decade too young for her role), announces she is divorcing Eddy (Alfred Molina), her husband of 36 years, who owns a bodega; he allegedly cheated. The notion that a family-loving matriarch would make such a surprise announcement (even Eddy is ambushed) at a festive holiday reunion is simply bizarre. 
Dinner, of course, is ruined. The taciturn Eddy, who urges a reluctant Jesse, the younger of his two sons, to go into the family business, has his own secret torment. (Hint: It’s medical.) 
Anna, as written, is a disagreeable piece of work.  She badgers her non-Hispanic daughter-in-law, Sarah (Debra Messing), a yuppie banker, to give her a grandchild and mutters nasty things about her in Spanish, which Sarah can’t understand. The movie appears to take Anna’s side. Sarah is married to Anna’s oldest son, Mauricio (an unconvincing John Leguizamo in expensive eyewear), a successful lawyer. 
Also on hand is a daughter, Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito), a struggling television actress living in Hollywood who is waiting for a call from her agent about a part. Will Roxanna hook up with her hunky but shady childhood friend Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who carries a gun along with a potentially lethal grudge against a neighbor? Ms. Ferlito and Mr. Hernandez lend the movie a smidgen of heat. 
The most engaging moments of “Nothing Like the Holidays” are the festive party sequences in which the characters throw off their troubles to dance in the bodega and pour into the street in their Christmas finery. Their troubles momentarily forgotten, the residents of Humboldt Park really know how to enjoy themselves. 
 “Nothing Like the Holidays” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a little violence and sexual situations.

‽
‽Doubt‽,‽The air is thick with paranoia in “Doubt,” but nowhere as thick, juicy, sustained or sustaining as Meryl Streep’s performance as a distrustful nun in John Patrick Shanley’s screen adaptation of his stage play. Wearing flowing black robes, a  bonnet  that squats on her head like an upside-down Easter basket and the kind of  spectacles Mr. Pickwick probably wore to read his papers, Ms. Streep blows in like a storm, shaking up the story’s reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy. The performance may make no sense in the context of the rest of the film, but it is — forgive me, Father — gratifying nunsense. 
Although the play, which pivots on accusations of child molestation, was first staged  in 2004 —  two years after the Roman Catholic Church  sex-abuse scandals erupted in America —  it unfolds at a  historical remove in 1964. Sister Aloysius (Ms. Streep), the principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx, comes to suspect that her supervisor, Father Flynn (a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest or worse in one of their charges, Donald (Joseph Foster II), the school’s first and only black student. Shored up by the tentative suspicions of a younger nun, Sister James (an unsteady Amy Adams), Sister Aloysius begins circling Father Flynn, going in for the kill. Sister James has doubts. Sister Aloysius has, well, none. 
As its title announces, “Doubt” isn’t about certainty, but ambiguity, that no man’s land between right and wrong, black and white. This gray zone paradoxically can be  easier to grapple with on the stage, where ideas sometimes range more freely because they are not tethered to representations of the real world. Mainstream moviemaking, with its commercial directives and slavish attachment to narrative codes, by contrast, isn’t particularly hospitable to ambiguity. It insists on clear parameters, tidy endings, easy answers and a world divided into heroes and villains, which may help explain why Mr. Shanley’s film feels caught between two mediums and why Ms. Streep appears to be in a Gothic horror thriller while everyone else looks and sounds closer to life or at least dramatic realism. 
Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, “Doubt” essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach. So does Father Flynn, a character who for a long stretch appears above reproach: a good, caring, forward-thinking man whose only crime seems to be tolerance. When he suggests that the school add a secular song to its Christmas lineup as a way of reaching out to the community, Sister Aloysius reacts as if he had suggested  human sacrifice instead. That he seems to embody the spirit of reform handed down by Second Vatican Council, which ended in 1965,  makes him all the more sympathetic. 
Directing from his own script, Mr. Shanley chips away at this sympathy, pulling the story and your feelings this way and that. One of the most eccentric moments in the film occurs when Father Flynn, after admonishing some male students about their dirty fingernails, shows off his long, carefully manicured nails. Mr. Shanley complicates this feeling of gender ambiguity   later when Father Flynn, having gone to Sister Aloysius’s office for a meeting, sits behind her desk without asking permission, an assertion of power that opens a fissure in his easygoing facade and says more about the church and gender than any of their increasingly heated exchanges. Mostly, though, the characters talk, and Mr. Shanley throws a frame around  their heads. 
Words make the world go ’round  here through repetitions, indirection, allusion as well as a cunning deployment of the barely said and the flat-out unspeakable. (The word “pedophilia” is never uttered.) When Sister James tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn has “taken an interest” in Donald, the words reverberate like a struck bell. Later, when Donald’s mother (Viola Davis, shaking the film up with a few extravagantly mucousy minutes) explains to Sister Aloysius why she wants to keep her son at school, no matter what the truth about the priest, her words resonate partly because they remain veiled by shame, propriety, fear, inequality, pain. What are you telling me? Sister Aloysius demands of the stunned mother, though it’s clear they both know the answer. 
Mr. Shanley has nothing deep to say about the church and its sex scandals, and he’s still largely using words and more words, despite the tilted camera angles and pretty pictures. But the words are good, solid, at times touching. His work with the actors is generally fine, though it’s a mystery what he thought Ms. Streep, with her wild eyes and an accent as wide as the  Grand Concourse, was doing. Her outsize performance has a whiff of burlesque, but she’s really just operating in a different register from the other actors, who are working in the more naturalistic vein of modern movie realism. She’s a hoot, but she’s also a relief, because, for some of us, worshiping Our Lady of Accents is easier on the soul than doing time in church. 
“Doubt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Intimations of child sexual abuse.

‽
‽Delgo‽,‽In the fictional land of Jhamora, the earthbound Lockni natives have come to distrust the winged Nohrin immigrants (a shared fondness for the silent “h” notwithstanding). So when a Lockni lad named Delgo (voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr.) develops a crush on the Nohrin princess Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt), her resemblance to Paula Abdul and his to a mottled potato are the least of their problems. 
Plundering the imaginations of Anne McCaffrey, Peter Jackson, George Lucas and Shakespeare, this barely animated fantasy suffers from more than just a lack of originality. Dreary battles and apathetic voice work — only Eric Idle, as a malaprop-prone servant, earns his fee — conspire in a sedition-oriented plot that not even six writers (including the directors, Marc F. Adler and Jason F. Maurer) are able to invigorate. 
Too leaden for adults and too baffling for kids (a gambling soldier whines about “the vig”), “Delgo” has a lumbering, prehistoric vibe fueled by dinosaur-derived creatures and images of intimidating density. Louis Gossett Jr.’s dignified baritone, emanating from the Nohrin king — whose bone structure recalls the alien played by Mr. Gossett in “Enemy Mine” — is no match for Chris Kattan’s grating contribution as Delgo’s shrieking sidekick, Filo. If only the evil empress Sedessa had crushed him beneath her heel instead of that innocent Lockni baby. 
“Delgo” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A wicked aunt, an endless war and unnecessarily tight unitards.

‽
‽Adam Resurrected‽,‽With his dark whirlpool eyes and sensual clown’s mouth, Jeff Goldblum has always suggested an actor poised to reveal a thousand faces, many of them nightmarish apparitions. In “The Fly” we saw a few of them; more emerge in the Holocaust survivor drama “Adam Resurrected.” The movie’s unsettling opening image is a close-up of his character, Adam Stein, in clown makeup, rolling his left eye while keeping the right stationary. 
In no particular order Mr. Goldblum’s shape-shifting character is an imperious circus magician and knife thrower, a dog whisperer, a wily seducer, a raging drunk and a traumatized observer of genocide. Mr. Goldblum’s tour-de-force performance, alas, is not enough to transmit a steady emotional current through the movie, directed by Paul Schrader from Noah Stollman’s adaptation of a 1968 novel by an Israeli, Yoram Kaniuk. 
A charismatic Jewish circus performer in 1930s Berlin, Adam survives the Holocaust by exploiting his skills as an entertainer. As the film goes on to explore his extreme case of survivor’s guilt after the war, it poses familiar questions about who is sane  in an insane world and assumes that simply reiterating those questions will suffice. The film is so flat that it leaves you wondering if Mr. Kaniuk’s book is ultimately untranslatable to the screen. 
The novel, which won extravagant critical acclaim and earned comparisons to “Catch-22” and the magical realism of Gabriel  García Márquez, takes the concept of being treated like a dog to its absurdist limits. After Adam is scooped up by the Nazis, he is forced to accept a Faustian arrangement: he lives in comfort at a concentration camp as the pet dog of Commandant Klein (Willem Dafoe), a Nazi officer who remembers  Adam’s nightclub animal act. 
This human dog is expected to amuse his owner by doing what David Letterman might call stupid  human tricks,  which distract Klein from the gruesome business at hand. Spending days on all fours, begging, rolling over and seizing hunks of meat with his teeth from the mouth of the commandant’s German shepherd  — with which he forms an animal bond —  Adam is a “good dog.” When not a pet, Adam is forced to play the violin and serenade his fellow prisoners, including his wife and daughter, as they are marched to the gas chambers. The scene in which they pass him on the way to the crematorium is one of the  potentially wrenching moments that the film throws away. 
The movie leaps around in time, from the 1930s and ’40s (in black-and-white sequences) to the 1950s and early  ’60s (color), when Adam is the star patient at a psychiatric treatment center for Holocaust survivors in the Negev desert. In these madhouse scenes Adam, much like McMurphy in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” has the run of the place. He swills booze out of the bottle and carries on an affair with the head nurse (Ayelet Zurer), who is so besotted with him that she eagerly grovels on all fours and barks for attention. 
The dog phobia Adam has had since his concentration camp days begins to dissolve and then to change into fatherly concern with his discovery of David (Tudor  Rapiteanu), a wild child sequestered in the hospital. Chained to his bed, clutching a sheet with eyeholes through which he peers like a Halloween ghost, David believes he is a dog. As Adam and David develop a bond, the boy takes his first lurching steps on two feet and begins to make human sounds. He becomes the vehicle for Adam’s “resurrection” to sanity. 
I can understand why Mr. Schrader and Mr. Stollman would resist milking these scenes for tear-jerking empathy, since the fable’s sardonic final twist is its suggestion that sanity, whatever that may be, robs existence of its divine fire. 
Savage gallows humor might have substituted for pathos. But “Adam Resurrected” feels so detached that there is not a laugh, nor even a wicked smirk of nihilistic glee, to be gleaned. 
 “Adam Resurrected” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of physical and emotional cruelty and sexual situations.

‽
‽Cadillac Records‽,‽In “Cadillac Records,” Darnell Martin’s rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues in its hectic golden age, Jeffrey Wright plays the singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. This feat is made even more impressive and interesting when you reflect that in the same movie season Mr. Wright has portrayed another notable real-life African-American, the former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in Oliver Stone’s “W.” The man is equally credible as a statesman and a bluesman. If that’s not range, what is? 
Much more than racial typecasting or clever mimicry is at work in these performances. Mr. Wright can hardly be said to bear a strong physical resemblance to Muddy Waters or Mr. Powell — or, for that matter, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom he played in the HBO film “Boycott,” or to the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, so brilliantly impersonated in “Basquiat.” 
Rather, Mr. Wright, as protean and serious an actor as any working in American movies, seems to be writing his own version of “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man,” the literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s collection of essays on various styles of African-American manhood. 
In each case, whether playing a former soldier or a tormented artist, Mr. Wright directs our attention away from the familiar, public face of the character in question toward a private zone where ambition struggles with anxiety, and where what seems to be at stake is nothing less than the integrity and viability of the self. And so, in his Muddy Waters, we see pride, ambition and uncertainty cohabiting with musical genius, sexual appetite and stubborn professionalism. 
“Cadillac Records” is by no means Mr. Wright’s film alone, and his work is enriched by the skill and verve of a prodigious ensemble. The film is not — thank goodness — another dutiful musical biopic, but rather the group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists, including Little Walter (Columbus Short), Chuck Berry (Mos Def), Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles), Howlin’ Wolf (Eamonn  Walker) and Willie Dixon, the bassist and songwriter who narrates in the mellow, countrified voice of Cedric the Entertainer. 
These musical innovators are gathered together — promoted, exploited and given shiny new Caddies with heavy strings attached — by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody), a Jewish entrepreneur in postwar Chicago who sees “race music” as a potential gold mine. That it also turns out to be an agent of wholesale cultural transformation — an old song observes that the blues had a baby, and they called it rock ’n’ roll — does not faze him in the least. 
Few subjects are as encrusted with legend, hyperbole and sheer bunk as the history of American popular music, and there will no doubt be pedants who will object to some of the liberties “Cadillac Records” has taken with the literal truth. At times Leonard Chess seems so stressed out by running the record company bearing his name that you wish he had, say, a brother to share the burden. The real Leonard Chess did, but for now Phil Chess will have to join Nesuhi Ertegun, brother of Ahmet, in the ranks of music industry siblings neglected by Hollywood. 
In any case, Ms. Martin, who wrote as well as directed “Cadillac Records,” does not need to lean too heavily on the historical record, or on the dreary conventions of pop-culture hagiography,  because she has a clear and complicated set of ideas about her characters and a deep appreciation of the music they made. It is, sadly, all too rare for a movie about important musicians to pay intelligent attention to the sounds and idioms that make their lives worth dramatizing in the first place. 
But in “Cadillac Records” you hear most of the important advances and developments that defined urban blues in the 1940s and ’50s. When Muddy Waters, newly arrived in Chicago from Mississippi, plugs his guitar into an amplifier, a new sonic mutation occurs. Then Chuck Berry comes along, playing in a speedier, country-inflected style that makes him the first major star to cross from the R&amp;B to the pop charts. 
“Cadillac Records” would be worth seeing for the music alone. Mr. Wright’s renditions of Muddy Waters’s signature songs are more than respectable, while Ms. Knowles’s interpretations of Ms. James’s hits — “At Last” and “I’d Rather Go Blind,” in particular — are downright revelatory. 
And so, it should be said, is Ms. Knowles’s performance. In her previous film roles she has seemed guarded and tentative, as if worried that her charisma would melt from too much emotional heat. Here, playing a needy, angry, ferociously talented and fantastically undisciplined woman, she is as volcanic and voluptuous as an Italian movie star. Or, more to the point, a real soul diva of the old school. 
The music is also a window into history, and “Cadillac Records” is an uncommonly astute treatment of race in America at the end of the Jim Crow era. Its dense, anecdotal narrative is built around the sometimes uneasy friendship between Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters, his first big star. Chess is devoted to his artists, but he also profits from their art, and Mr. Brody shows him to be neither a paragon of racial enlightenment nor a predator. 
“His job is to make money off you,” Howlin’ Wolf says to Muddy Waters, who is hurt by what he sees as Chess’s double-dealing. “You’re from Mississippi. I thought you would have known that.” 
The rivalry between those two bluesmen is another source of intrigue in “Cadillac Records,” which sustains a remarkable number of dramatically important relationships, any one of which could have been a movie in its own right. Muddy Waters is also a mentor to Little Walter — a troubled, reckless, brilliant harmonica player — and a steadfast (if unfaithful) husband to Geneva (Gabrielle Union). Chess, meanwhile, though he is married (his wife, Revetta, is played by Emmanuelle Chriqui) is nearly undone by his passion for Etta James. 
So much passion, so much pain, so much tenderness and violence. If you dig up an album from the heyday of Chess Records, you’ll find all that and more. And “Cadillac Records” is nearly as good as one of those albums, which is saying a lot. This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that’s just fine. Like those big, boxy Caddies (and like Howlin’ Wolf, if he did say so himself), it’s built for comfort, not for speed. It hums, it purrs and it roars. 
“Cadillac Records” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has smoking, swearing, sex and mayhem in excess, which is just the right amount.

‽Nobel Son‽,‽At some point Randall Miller, who has directed one movie about ballroom dancing and another about the wine trade — apparently decided he wanted to become a tough guy, or at least flex his genre muscles. Thus “Nobel Son,” an aggressively noisy exercise in style over substance about nasty people doing nasty things to one another in (sigh) Southern California. Like many contemporary genre flicks, the new movie features a hyperactive visual style that owes its tricks and tics, smeared images and staccato cuts to art-house exploitation like “City of God” and latter-day Tony Scott, but without the commensurate technical finesse. 
Alan Rickman plays Eli Michaelson, who shortly after the story chugs to a start has won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, a milestone that delights no one save for him. A world-class heel and adulterer, a lousy father (to Bryan Greenberg’s Barkley) and worse husband (to Mary Steenburgen’s Sarah), Eli, with his monstrous ego, would be enough for a lot of movies but turns out to be merely the warm-up act for a chaotic plot involving a violent kidnapping, a distant suicide, murky secrets and outright distortions. Mr. Greenberg, whose character is writing a dissertation about cannibalism (he appears to be pro), somehow crosses paths first with Eliza Dushku and then with Shawn Hatosy, both of whom are better than their material. 
Mr. Miller is clearly slumming in “Nobel Son” (it was shot before his recently released “Bottle Shock”), which wouldn’t be a problem if he seemed to be interested in playing with genre rather than condescending to it, as he does here. But from story to casting, “Nobel Son” feels designed for mockery, from the stunt casting (Danny DeVito as a dim-bulb neighbor, Ted Danson as a bow-tied academic) to the lazy parodies of coffeehouse poetry readings to the treatment of poor Ms. Dushku, who, as a wild-eyed poet who sleeps with the nominal hero, not only has to play the crazy woman and a hack artist but also has to brandish her thong underwear. Isn’t being young and female in Hollywood punishment enough? 
There’s a bit more, mostly a throbbing techno score and a showy, disappointing performance from the almost always welcome Mr. Rickman. (He and Bill Pullman, who has a small role in this film as the requisite rumpled cop, were the headliners in “Bottle Shock.”) As Eli, Mr. Rickman oozes from scene to scene doing a fair approximation of a lizard with a little Joan Crawford thrown in for good (or bad) measure. Although it’s amusing to watch him point his nose in the air while taking aim at the ostensibly nicer characters, all of whom are even more tedious than Eli, the performance grows thin fast. Even lizards and villains need a perch, something more solid than noise and smears from which they can do their slithering. 
“Nobel Son” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). One scene features the very bloody, nonsurgical removal of a thumb.

‽Let Them Chirp Awhile‽,‽Having heard once too often that his outfit is kind of lame, Bobby (Justin Rice), a useless East Village hipster, tucks into the American Apparel store on Houston Street and picks out a baby blue T-shirt with some help from Charlotte (Charlotte Af Geijerstam), a failed actress in hot pants and leg warmers. Later they meet for a drink and commiserate about their boring, complacent, privileged lives. 
“The old city,” Bobby muses, “like the one that I dreamed about, the one from the movies. It’s not there anymore. Maybe we’re both just maladjusted, you know, like we’re living in the past.” 
And thus, for one brief moment, does “Let Them Chirp Awhile” acknowledge the source of its painfully unsympathetic take on postcollegiate New Yorkers who think themselves artists but don’t have an original thought in their heads. 
Written and directed by Jonathan Blitstein, the movie really does live in an imaginary past, the one immortalized in classic Woody Allen films. How else to explain why Bobby and his circle of friends name-drop Chekhov, pontificate on Bergman, crack tired jokes about Los Angeles and spend all their time either failing at relationships or kvetching  about their inadequacies while whimsical jazz coos on the soundtrack? 
This sort of thing was indulgent enough the first time around; transplanted to the mumblecore milieu, it’s intolerable.

‽Punisher: War Zone‽,‽“Who punishes you?” someone asks Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson), better known as the Punisher, in the punishing new entertainment called “Punisher: War Zone.”  It’s a fair enough question, but the one I had as I sat through 107 bloody, grinding minutes was a little different: What did I ever do to deserve this? 
Dumb question, I know. It’s silly to take the brutality of “Punisher: War Zone,” which is based on a comic book with a devoted following, seriously or personally. Guys get their heads blown off, or severed, or pierced with chair legs, or pulverized with fists, because that’s what they have coming and that’s what the fan base will pay money to see. But does it have to be so witless, so stupid, so openly contemptuous of the very audience it’s supposed to be pandering to? 
More dumb questions! I understand that the picture, directed with grisly intensity by Lexi Alexander, is a big, bloody cartoon. At its center is a grim, humorless avenger whose nemesis is a onetime mobster named Jigsaw (Dominic West), so called because his face was disfigured in a recycling accident. Jigsaw has a crazy brother named Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) — but, really, why bother? You will see this movie or not, and it will make about as much sense to you either way. There is, however, one line that is, if not quite clever, at least relevant for the purposes of concluding this review. As the Punisher says to a bad guy he’s about to waste, “I guess I’ll put you out of my misery.” 
“Punisher: War Zone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing and extremely graphic killing.

‽Repo Chick‽,‽Repo Chick 
Opens on Friday  in Manhattan.  
Directed by Alex Cox 
1 hour 25 minutes; not rated 
The problems with “Repo Chick,” Alex Cox’s extreme satire for the age of foreclosure, begin with Jaclyn Jonet’s personality-free portrayal of its heroine, Pixxi De La Chasse, a mouthy Paris Hilton-like celebutante who is disinherited by her wealthy family. To earn a living, Pixxi becomes a repossessor who hunts and terrorizes “main-line mortgage abusers.” Her ultimate assignment, however, is to collect a million-dollar bounty for some antique railroad cars. All the while, she is being filmed by her punk posse for a reality show to appear on closed-circuit television in a Dubai hotel. 
Pixxi eventually finds herself imprisoned while aboard those elusive railroad cars during a fake publicity junket organized by eco-terrorists who threaten to blow up Los Angeles with missing Soviet growler bombs (stored in the caboose) from the Communist era. The city will be spared only if the president criminalizes golf and the government turns vegan. By this time, “Repo Chick” has deteriorated from a clotted comic mess into a leaden thriller spoof. 
The movie’s title is its only real connection with Mr. Cox’s 1984 cult favorite, “Repo Man,” to which it is definitely not a sequel. Shot almost entirely on a soundstage against a green screen, “Repo Chick” might be described as a toy movie. Its cast includes several alumni of earlier films by Mr. Cox, including Chloe Webb, who played Nancy Spungen in “Sid and Nancy.” 
Much of the wit, such as it is, can be found on roadside billboards that read “God loves golf,” “Eat meat,” and “A is for apathy, B is for boredom, and C is for clinical depression.” You may find yourself in the C state if you subject yourself to this comic mishap, whose satire already feels out of date. STEPHEN HOLDEN  Breaking and Entering 
Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.   
Directed by Benjamin Fingerhut 
1 hour 28 minutes; not rated 
The only significantly false note in “Breaking and Entering” is its overly clever title, which doesn’t give you much of a clue that it’s a film about people obsessed with getting their names in the Guinness Book of World Records. Otherwise, Benjamin Fingerhut’s documentary is a brisk and absorbing tour of the human ego. 
Mr. Fingerhut keeps his narration-free film (the only voices we hear belong to the record seekers and their family and friends whom they haven’t driven away) moving at such a fast pace that you may not notice how it’s been stitched together. Three stories — of a grape catcher, an endurance stationary cyclist (symbolically racing to nowhere) and a pair of marathon jogglers — are covered in some depth, but the film also drops in on a banjo picker, a concrete-block breaker, a whip cracker, a ball spinner, a finger snapper and a telephone-book-ripping couple, among many others. Apparently Mr. Fingerhut never met a record seeker he didn’t like. 
“Breaking and Entering” never mocks or questions its subjects; the more introspective of these obsessive record chasers take care of that themselves. There’s definitely no place for mockery in the case of the jogglers Michal Kapral and Zach Warren, who can each run a marathon, juggling three balls the entire route, in under three hours. When you can do that, who needs Guinness? MIKE HALE  
A Somewhat Gentle Man 
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.  
Directed by Hans Petter Moland 
 In Norwegian, with English subtitles 
 1 hour 43 minutes; not rated 
Like its glum antihero, “A Somewhat Gentle Man” takes a little time to find its feet. Until it does, you may struggle to care about Ulrik (Stellan Skarsgard), a middle-aged murderer newly released from prison. Beefy and slow-moving, quiet and ponytailed, Ulrik seems content to observe freedom rather than embrace it. His former boss (a strutting Bjorn Floberg) expects him to kill the snitch who put him away for 12 years, but Ulrik is done with violence — or so he thinks. 
A story about old men bobbing in the wake of a young man’s profession (among Ulrik’s former associates, diabetes, stroke and a colostomy have taken their toll), this Norwegian entry in the deadpan gangster comedy genre finds its mournful tone in Patsy Cline’s tunes and Mr. Skarsgard’s doleful puss. Surrounded by truculent women and ridiculous men — all of them sporting lank hair, dingy skin and homeless-shelter fashions — Ulrik accepts a job as a car mechanic and enjoys the steamed cod and sexual favors of his guillotine-faced landlady (Jorunn Kjellsby). In lieu of pillow talk, they watch the Polish version of “Dancing With the Stars.” 
Patiently directed by Hans Petter Moland, Ulrik’s journey back to life slowly draws you in. As he tentatively reaches out to his estranged son (Jan Gunnar Roise) and an emotionally fragile co-worker (Jannike Kruse), his complexion visibly warms. When, in the film’s beatific final moments, Ulrik beams for the first time, it’s what we’ve been waiting for all along. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS   
Plastic Planet 
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.  
 Directed by Werner Boote 
 In English and German, with English subtitles 
 1 hour 39 minutes; not rated 
From pantyhose to Porta Potties, plastic — the catch-all term for a wide variety of synthetic materials — has infiltrated virtually every aspect of modern life. For the Austrian filmmaker Werner Boote, it’s personal: plastic is, quite literally, in his blood. As we discover in “Plastic Planet,” it’s probably in ours, too. 
And not just because of our addiction to Tupperware. Among the film’s many fascinating and ultimately alarming claims is that, for most of its roughly 500-year life expectancy, plastic slowly releases molecules of maleficence into the food chain, many of them linked to sexual abnormalities in fish and infertility in humans. 
There’s more than enough material here for a meaty exposé, but Mr. Boote (the grandson of a plastics manufacturer, now deceased) is less focused than a kitten in a yarn store. Hugging a plastic globe from China, he zips through no fewer than 14 countries to interview plastic lovers and haters, scientists and citizens. 
An appealingly eccentric guide, Mr. Boote trots from an environmental dispute in Venice to a rubbish dump in India, and meets a Japanese sculptor  and an American plastic surgeon. Sniffing and licking as he goes, and pausing to rub his face vigorously with bioplastics, the director favors a peripatetic style that staves off boredom but is frustratingly shallow. 
Sometimes things get a little weird, as Mr. Boote questions a woman on the sensations caused by her breast implants, and later — channeling Michael Moore — visits a trade show grasping a megaphone. 
“You will get big breasts,” he warns the attendees, noting the possible hormonal disruptions caused by their products. And while these digressions lighten the film’s mood, “Plastic Planet” does little but raise an alarm, then leave it jangling. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS  
‽
‽Mugabe and the White African‽,‽Lucy Bailey and Andrew Thompson’s “Mugabe and the White African” is a documentary account of the efforts of Mike Campbell and his son-in-law, Ben Freeth, to hold onto their farm. It tracks their precedent-setting lawsuit against Robert Mugabe, the authoritarian Zimbabwean president, in a regional African court, as well as events on the ground in Zimbabwe: intimidation, threats and violence against the white farmers still holding out after a decade of  land seizures by the government. 
Many viewers will leave “Mugabe and the White African” thinking that they have seen few, if any, documentaries as wrenching, sad and infuriating, and those feelings will be justified. What has happened (and continues to happen) to the Campbells, the Freeths and some of their white neighbors is not only unjust but also a horrifying, slow-motion nightmare.  That sensation is reinforced by the movie’s political-thriller style, partly a result of the covert filming methods necessary in a country where practicing journalism can get you thrown in jail. 
It should be pointed out, though, that Ms. Bailey and Mr. Thompson achieve their results largely through the narrowness of their focus. Almost the only voices we hear are those of the farmers, their families and their lawyers. Other viewpoints are limited to a rant by the man, a government minister’s son, to whom the farm has been promised, and Mr. Mugabe’s recorded voice, including his notorious line that he doesn’t mind being seen as a Hitler by the West. 
It’s possible to honor the suffering of the Campbells and the Freeths and to revile the actions of the Mugabe government and, at the same time, to be uneasy with the emotions the film stirs and to feel that its one-sidedness and its nearly complete lack of historical and cultural context are problems. The farm’s black work force is frequently on screen and is presented as sympathetic to its employers, but the workers rarely speak. It’s impossible to know what their true, probably complex and contradictory feelings are. 
Mr. Freeth asks why being a white African should be any different than being a white American or a white Australian. It’s a good sound bite, but a moment’s reflection tells you that the comparison doesn’t hold water: the courses of colonialism and racial strife were radically different in America and Australia than they were in Africa. That doesn’t make Mr. Freeth’s cause any less just, but it does mean that “Mugabe and the White African” needs to be approached with care. 
‽
‽Living in Emergency‽,‽At one point in “Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders,” Mark Hopkins’s new documentary about that Paris-based humanitarian group, an Australian doctor stationed in Congo, his tongue loosened by a lot of local beer, unloads his scorn for Unicef and other, similar organizations. They approach mass suffering, he says, by way of theories, meetings and high-minded statements of principle, whereas he and other Doctors Without Borders physicians meet the consequences of war, epidemic and natural disaster one patient at a time. 
The organization, also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, was founded in France in 1971 and is devoted to the simple idea that its doctors should go where they are desperately needed without regard for political considerations or long-term agendas. Though the film spends a little time at the organization’s headquarters, it basically adheres to this ground-level approach, following a few volunteers in the field as they treat the sick and wounded and try to uphold modern standards of care in rough and sometimes horrifying circumstances. 
A more conventional kind of documentary might have delved deeper into the history and philosophy of the organization, one of whose founders was Bernard Kouchner, a former leftist militant who is now foreign minister in France’s right-of-center government. (A fascinating account of Mr. Kouchner’s career can be found in Paul Berman’s book “Power and the Idealists.”) And, similarly, if “Living in Emergency” had stuck more closely to the conventions of movies that seek to raise Western awareness of terrible situations elsewhere in the world, it would have explored what is going on in Liberia and Congo, where most of the film takes place. 
But that kind of contextualization would have been antithetical both to the organization’s mission and to Mr. Hopkins’s own interest, which is in the particular challenges faced by individual doctors who sign up for six-month tours in what they routinely describe as some of the worst places on earth. What we know about Liberia, for the purposes of the film, is that it recently emerged from a long, unimaginably brutal civil war of the kind that Congo is still suffering. This means that the devastation the medical volunteers find in Liberia is leavened by hope, and that the superior facilities that seem to exist in Congo are under constant threat of violence. 
Doctors in Congo treat gunshot and machete wounds, whereas their counterparts in Liberia deal with infectious diseases, malnutrition and the effects of poor sanitation. And while some of the drama in “Living in Emergency” comes from the tension of specific cases — will the boy with the head wound survive? what is causing that child’s face and belly to swell? — the film, just like any good hospital television series, is really about the curious psychology of the medical profession. It is, most affectingly, a series of portraits depicting men and women who, while they are undeniably selfless, brave and hard-working, can also be vain, jealous, self-righteous and, from time to time, drunk. 
Mr. Hopkins gravitates toward four  doctors in particular: Tom Krueger, a surgeon from Tennessee; Chris Brasher, an Australian who has given most of his career to the organization, and whose work for it fills his nomadic life with novelty, danger and meaning; Chiara Lepora, who is Italian and oversees the group’s activities in Liberia; and Davinder Gill, another Australian, who works virtually alone at a clinic in a remote, rural part of that country. Dr. Lepora likens Dr. Gill to Kurtz in Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness,” going slowly mad in the bush, but he is also furious at the lack of logistical and moral support coming from her. 
These doctors are hard on themselves and on one another, and as “Living in Emergency” chronicles their small triumphs and large frustrations, a larger picture emerges, almost despite the film’s avowedly local emphasis. Doctors Without Borders, for all its global prestige, is a small organization, and since it cannot be everywhere at once, it must often leave places like Liberia just as things are starting to improve. The extent of the need around the world is so enormous and overwhelming that the efforts of the doctors in this sobering film seem both vitally necessary and woefully inadequate.

‽
‽Mine‽,‽One from the heart, the documentary “Mine” relates yet one more wrenching, infuriating story about Hurricane Katrina and the devastation wreaked both by the storm and by human error and indifference. While many victims in the movie will look familiar — whether waving from their New Orleans rooftops after the levees broke in 2005 or talking about their ruined lives and homes afterward — the majority of the victims here have usually been seen only in the background, forlornly howling and wagging their tails. 
Directed by Geralyn Pezanoski, making a fine feature debut, “Mine” tells the story of the pets, mostly dogs and cats, left behind during the storm when their humans were forced to flee. Like much of the rest of the world, Ms. Pezanoski followed the news in horror as a natural disaster morphed into a larger catastrophe. What caught her eye, however, and clearly also her emotions, were the impromptu animal-rescue teams that sprang into action and, from across America, descended on New Orleans. She flew to the inundated city and with a small team spent six weeks following rescuers as they broke into homes, clambering through windows and crawl spaces to save masses of frightened, starving animals. 
Smartly, Ms. Pezanoski didn’t stop shooting once the waters retreated and the excitement and political controversy died down. Realizing that the rescued animals were now separated from companions who were scattered around the country and, importantly, were at first forbidden to return to New Orleans (and their pets), she kept her attention fixed and her digital video camera running. Those who tracked this story know what happened next, which doesn’t lessen its impact. By the time some New Orleans pet owners returned to the city, their animals had been shipped out of state, where they were sometimes placed in foster homes and even adopted. New Orleans residents like Malvin Cavalier, a dapper octogenarian who made a jaunty pair with his fluffy white dog, Bandit, were robbed of their homes and closest friends. 
Go ahead and get a tissue to wipe your tears. I did. “Mine” isn’t fully successful — it’s a bit ragged and, at 81 minutes, far too short for the scope of its ambitions — but it’s smart, sincere and affecting. The emotional impact deepens as Ms. Pezanoski begins to narrow her focus, interviewing residents like Mr. Cavalier, along with Jessie Pullins and Gloria Richardson, two other pet owners who were separated from their animals. Mr. Pullins named his cute mutt J. J., as in Jessie Jr., and hangs onto memories of his dog as if the animal were hope itself. Ms. Richardson is an elderly woman who was forcibly removed from her home, even after she insisted on not being separated from her Labrador, Murphy Brown. (All the separation stories are about dogs.) 
As is true of every Katrina story, race and class play significant roles in “Mine,” which grows more disturbing as the weeks melt into years. The animal rescue world can be an eccentric battlefield, a place where pets matter more than their people, and Ms. Pezanoski registers its admirable and unsettling elements fairly. When a white lawyer chides a black woman for abandoning her dog — the woman says she had her hands full rescuing her children and wheelchair-bound mother — it’s hard not to flash back to those commentators who wondered why the poor inhabitants  of New Orleans didn’t just leave in their nonexistent cars. Ms. Pezanoski can only offer a gloss on this world of pain, but she does so with compassion and admirable patience.

‽Garbage Dreams‽,‽Following on the grimy heels of “Marina of the Zabbaleen” (released here in September) comes “Garbage Dreams,” a second documentary about a poor community of trash recyclers on the outskirts of Cairo. But in the hands of the director and photographer Mai Iskander, this new film digs deeper into the politics of a life that few would choose but many depend on. 
With no official sanitation services, Cairo’s 18 million residents have for decades relied on zabbaleen (Arabic for “garbage people”) to collect their waste, which the zabbaleen do with enviable thoroughness   and an 80 percent recycling rate. Filming over four years, Ms. Iskander highlights three charismatic youths as they face competition from foreign companies with more mechanized, if significantly less green, methods. 
Expertly weaving personal fears, family tensions and political action (the zabbaleen don’t whine; they strive to modernize), “Garbage Dreams” records the tremblings of a culture at a crossroads. At no point is this more evident than when two of the young men, sponsored by a Welsh recycling group, travel to a sleek recycling plant in Wales. One moment they’re on a mound of rubbish in Cairo, picking through plastic and shards of glass, the next they’re surrounded by Welsh pastures and humming conveyor belts. 
Nabil, 18, is unimpressed. “Here there’s technology but no precision,” he snorts, appalled at the plant’s recycling rate of around 20 percent. To the zabbaleen, machines are useful, but ancient knowledge is priceless.

‽Old Partner‽,‽Animals are hardly rare on film these days, but most  are bred in digital laboratories and given voice and charisma by movie stars. The inscrutable dignity of actual beasts is less often captured and may even seem strange when encountered in a documentary like “Old Partner,” the first feature directed by Lee Chung-ryoul. 
To call an ancient, slow-moving, nameless ox the hero of the film would be a slight distortion, since the only actions he performs are the ones that have defined his daily existence for more than 30 years. He ruminates. He pulls a plow and occasionally a cart, moving with exquisite slowness as the world goes rushing by. His body is bony and massive, and his face is a perpetual enigma, expressing steadfastness, resignation or, more likely, a state of bovine consciousness beyond the ken of humans. 
Not that this ox, thought to be the oldest in South Korea, is a stranger to people. On the contrary, he is the longtime companion of an elderly farming couple, Choi Won-kyun and Lee Sam-soon. Older than most of their nine children, the ox has shared their daily round of work and rest, a utilitarian arrangement that turns out to be surprisingly complicated. In his quiet, unassuming way, the animal sits at the apex of a love triangle, serving Mr. Choi as a helpmate  and confidant and representing, to Ms. Lee, a rival for her husband’s devotion. 
Mr. Choi, frail and partially deaf, one of his legs withered by a long-ago accident, is cantankerous and impatient with his wife and tenderly solicitous of his beast of burden. He prepares special fodder, and keeps his fields pesticide-free. When, late in the film, he reluctantly agrees to sell the ox at an agricultural fair, he is shocked at  the low  offers. It is  also possible that he has set his asking price high enough to make a sale unlikely. 
Ms. Lee, meanwhile, who has no grudge against the ox (though she seems to prefer a younger heifer), peppers her husband with complaints that sound both sincere and habitual. She works hard, she’s tired and she has wasted her life on the wrong man. Mr. Choi tunes her out, but  he is quick to respond whenever the ox seems to need something. 
Still, the condition these three  share can  be described only as happiness, though it is not the kind of material comfort often associated with that word. Rather, like the French farmers in Raymond Depardon’s documentaries on rural life or the shepherds in the recent Kazakh film “Tulpan,” they represent an old and difficult way of life that seems to be fading  before our eyes. The  elderly couple’s relationship with the animal who has shared their lives may seem odd, charming and a bit absurd, but the deep and poignant insight of Mr. Lee’s film is that such complicated interspecies bonds are perfectly natural.

‽
‽Sherlock Holmes‽,‽Early in “Sherlock Holmes” — and also again, later on — the famous sleuth demonstrates his ratiocinative powers in a way undreamed of by his creator, Arthur Conan Doyle. Observing a thug standing guard over a horrible crime in a dimly lighted church, Holmes calculates just how to surprise the man, disarm him and beat him senseless. The audience follows his thought process through slow-motion pre-enactment, observing how the laws of anatomy and physics will be used to snap bones, gouge organs and turn flesh into pulp. Then, having seen it diagramed once on screen, we see it all again, with more noise, in real time. Elementary! 
Doyle’s Holmes, who arrived in Victorian pop culture in 1887 (with the publication of “A Study in Scarlet”), has adapted since then to changes in taste and entertainment technology. He was a proto-superhero, amenable to all kinds of elaboration and variation, and even a measure of mockery, as long as the basics of the brand were respected. For most of his existence he has lived at 221B Baker Street, smoking a pipe, playing the violin and sticking faithfully to bachelorhood and his belief in the functional elegance of the deerstalker hat. 
But Holmes has never been much for physical violence, and the chief innovation of this new, franchise-ready incarnation, directed by Guy Ritchie and played by Robert Downey Jr., is that he is, in addition to everything else, a brawling, head-butting, fist-in-the-gut, knee-in-the-groin action hero. 
A smart one, for sure, and as played by Mr. Downey, with his characteristic twitchy wit and haggard insouciance, he has more intelligence than the movie knows what to do with. (His Holmes has also lost the deerstalker, favoring battered porkpie- or bowlerlike headwear, perhaps in homage to Charlie Chaplin, another character Mr. Downey has played.) 
Of course intelligence has never ranked high among either Mr. Ritchie’s interests or his attributes as a filmmaker. His primary desire, most successfully realized early in his directing career, in “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and “Snatch,” has always been to be cool: to make cool movies about cool guys with cool stuff.  Yes, “Sherlock Holmes” is kind of cool. But that’s not really a compliment. 
Still, it’s Christmas, and the teenage boys in the house have fructose in their bloodstreams and time on their hands, so let’s call it half a compliment. There are worse things than loutish, laddish cool, and as a series of poses and stunts, “Sherlock Holmes” is intermittently diverting. 
The visual style — a smoky, greasy, steam-punk rendering of Victorian London, full of soot and guts and bad teeth and period clothes — shows some undeniable flair. And so do the kinetic chases and scrapes that lead us through the city, as Holmes and his pal Watson (Jude Law) scramble to unravel a conspiracy so diabolical that it fails to be  interesting. Best of all is the banter between Mr. Downey and Mr. Law, who is looser and more mischievous than he’s allowed himself to be in quite some time. The mustache suits him. 
Speaking of which: the beard is Rachel McAdams. She is inserted into the picture in a pretty, flouncy red dress to add a splash of color and dispel a few hints of homoerotic subtext. Holmes and Watson are longtime roommates, with an Oscar-and-Felix routine of quarrelsome affection. Watson’s engagement to a page of half-written dialogue named Mary (Kelly Reilly) sends Holmes into a snit of jealousy, which loses some of its interesting implications when Ms. McAdams shows up as a luscious thief named Irene Adler. I wonder: is she an ancestor of Jake and Jane Adler, the main characters of “It’s Complicated,” which also opens on Friday? Or does a movie opening on Christmas need to have a character named Adler in it for some reason? 
Ms. McAdams, in any case, is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene, though she figures in a few of Conan Doyle’s stories, feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something for the ladies — who, according to airtight Hollywood corporate logic, are more likely to see a movie like this one if there’s a feisty woman in it — and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls. 
Just like Holmes and Watson! They really do, in spite of the barely sublimated physical passion they manifest for each other in nearly every scene. I’m sure Warner Brothers would like me to change the subject and tell you about the amazing diabolical conspiracy that tests Holmes’s ingenuity, along with his faith in the supremacy of reason. 
It seems that an evil aristocrat (Mark Strong), executed for a series of murders, returns from the dead to mobilize an ancient secret society that he may have time-traveled into a Dan Brown novel to learn about. Doesn’t that sound fascinating? I thought not. But there will be a sequel, for which this frantic, harmless movie serves as an extended teaser, and it looks as if it might feature Holmes’s literary archnemesis, Professor Moriarty. No doubt Holmes will break a chair over Moriarty’s head, kidney-punch him and kick him in the face. Wittily, though, like the great detective he is. 
  
“Sherlock Holmes” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of fighting and not too much girl stuff.

‽
‽It's Complicated‽,‽In the pleasurable, daffy if at times daft “It’s Complicated,” Meryl Streep plays Jane Adler, a successful restaurateur who’s about to nest happily alone in an upscale Southern California coastal community, or so it seems. Divorced with three adult children who enjoy her company (the middle one is just moving out), Jane lives in a large house on a lush sprawl surrounded by trees and no visible neighbors. It’s such a bucolic vision you half expect a few deer, a couple of bunnies and the bluebird of happiness to swing by for a visit and a quick song. Instead you get Rita Wilson trilling support as one of Jane’s close friends. 
“It’s Complicated” was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, a Hollywood filmmaker who makes female-specific indulgences that, at their irresistible best, are testaments to the power of fairy tales. Like her finest film, “Something’s Gotta Give” (2003), this new one revolves around a woman in late middle age, who, after years of going it alone in bed and out, suddenly becomes sexually and romantically involved with two very different men. What kinks up “It’s Complicated” ever so slightly is that one of the two suitors here is Jane’s former husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin), an unreconstructed womanizer now married to the much-younger Agness (Lake Bell), a hard-bellied beauty with abs and smiles of steel. 
Those intimidating abs are as important to Agness’s outsider status in the story as the kooky spelling of her name, which stands out next to the reassuringly ordinary Jane, Jake and the fourth wheel, Adam (Steve Martin), who also catches Jane’s eye. Agness enters belly first, sashaying into the opening scene as the camera and Jane both fix on Agness’s stomach, an image that underscores her fertility while also reducing her to a body part (and lopping off her head). “Something’s Gotta Give” opens on a similar thematic note with images of sylphlike young beauties striding across the screen, their legs slicing the frame. We have met the enemy, Ms. Meyers seems to be suggesting, and she is firmer  —  and younger. 
Younger, perhaps, but never better, at least in Meyersland. One of the most interesting things about Ms. Meyers’s romances is that they are pitched at a niche demographic, by which I mean women over 40. Ms. Streep looks sensational, but she and her crinkles also look close enough to her real age (60) to reassure you that she hasn’t resorted to the knife. That may sound grotesque and petty. But in an industry in which actresses whittle themselves down to nothing so they can have a little screen space only to fade away once they hit a certain age, there’s nothing trivial about a movie that insists a middle-aged woman with actual breasts and hips and wrinkles can be beautiful and desirable while also fully desiring. 
Jane’s lust (and lustiness) kicks in after she and Jake land in New York to attend the college graduation of their youngest, Luke (Hunter Parrish). After a coincidental meeting at a bar, the parents end up drinking and dancing the night away, capping their giddy evening with an off-screen bout between the sheets. Afterward a grinning Jake enthuses over the encounter, a recap that a stunned-looking Jane answers by vomiting. But if Jane has doubts, which she shares through Ms. Meyers’s customary stream of babble, the heart or maybe the head wants what it wants. Whatever the case, Jane and Jake continue their affair back home, sneaking around while their children, as well as Agness and Adam remain oblivious. 
Ms. Meyers and her interviewers like to invoke the comedies of Ernst Lubitsch (“The Shop Around the Corner”) as one of her inspirations. But watching a Grand Prix race doesn’t make you a Formula One champion. Her cinematographers tend to be first rate (John Toll shot this one), yet Ms. Meyers doesn’t have her own visual signature. What she does have is a kind of upmarket taste and the means to translate it onto the screen. Here, as in the other films she has directed, the camera is little more than a machine that takes nicely lighted pictures of the designer items, the actors included, which she has amassed and, with the exacting attention of an interior decorator, prettily arranged inside the frame. 
At the same time there’s no doubt that she is an auteur, in that the films she has directed, including “What Women Want” and “The Holiday,” express a personal vision. Being an auteur isn’t simply a matter of what you do with the camera and why; among other things, pacing also counts (and Ms. Meyers has very good comic timing when it comes to banter) as do the performances. The movie’s best moments may be, to borrow a thought from Andrew Sarris, appreciated as exquisite whimsy (he was talking about a 1935 romantic comedy), but even in such whimsy, Mr. Sarris reminds us, a  director’s touch can be “immortalized as a figure of style.” 
Ms. Meyers’s vision can be maddeningly narrow and not only because her movies take place in cosseted, largely white worlds where the help is discreetly out of view. Both “It’s Complicated” and “Something’s Gotta Give” center on an independent woman whose life, despite all its personal and professional markers, immediately expands — even as it shrinks — once a man starts rocking her bed and head. Before her first adulterous night with Jake, Jane is a melancholy solo act, whether she’s weeping in her kitchen after her daughter moves out or trading somewhat desperately raunchy sex jokes with her girlfriends. Jake’s attentions give Jane snap, vibrancy, some color in her cheeks and, most important, a comic foil. Jake, in other words, turns her into a Nancy Meyers character. 
In “It’s Complicated” Ms. Meyers transforms a divorced couple into a romantic couple, which suggests a belief in love enduring even after a marriage dies. That sounds wonderfully romantic or a prescription for pathology, maybe both. Whatever the balance between madness and madcap, classic screwball comedies involve a woman and a man meeting on the battlefield or in a newspaper office and sparring their way into coupledom. Ms. Meyers wants, as her title implies, to complicate that formula. But no matter how liberating some of her conceits, notably the older heroine, her embrace of sexist stereotypes, including male characters as agents of narrative change, keep her and her female characters down. 
And yet ... much as Diane Keaton did in “Something’s Gotta Give,” Ms. Streep, mugging wildly if winningly, takes this character and makes you love her, just as Mr. Baldwin does with Jake, who, with his shark smiles and thrusting gut, beautifully conveys male vanity in its twilight. Jane may be too perfectly dressed, coiffed and housed to be plausible. But Ms. Streep makes you believe in Jane, or rather makes you want to believe in her, from her casually chic wardrobe to the indulgent smiles she bestows on her children and lovers, all of whom need nurturing. The truth is that everyone needs a little coddling, which could be the key to Ms. Meyers’s peculiar talent: She pampers her audience shamelessly. 
“It’s Complicated” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Some tame nuzzling and a little pot smoking.

‽Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel‽,‽In the final scene of “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,” Alvin and his two brothers bed down for the night just a few feet away from three singing female chipmunks. Chipmunks are not exactly known for their restraint, which leads us to some depressing math. 
The Eastern chipmunk can produce two litters a year, with up to five young each. Thus within a decade, since cartoon chipmunks never die, there will be thousands of talking, singing chipmunks running around the animation universe, far more than the ecosystem can tolerate. They will begin showing up everywhere: stampeding through “The Simpsons,” mucking up Japanese anime, driving Clifford the Big Red Dog bonkers. Earplug sales will soar as they sing their electronically manipulated heads off. 
Anyway, the latest adventures of Alvin, Simon and Theodore find them pursuing the rock-star careers they began in the 2007 “Alvin” film (which, like this one, mixes live action and computer-generated imagery). Their human handler, Dave, ends up in traction within the first minutes of the movie, which somehow results in the boys’ being enrolled in school, which they inexplicably begin at the high school level. Or something like that. 
The school’s music program is about to be cut, so the boys enter a talent contest, planning to use the $25,000 prize to save the music department. Whichever of the writers credited here thinks $25,000 is enough to finance a high school music program needs to go to a few more school budget meetings. In any case, a girl chipmunk group, the Chipettes, is also in the hunt, providing the plot, such as it is. 
The earlier “Alvin” movie made more than $217 million just in the United States. It’s hard to imagine this somewhat confused sequel doing as well. 
“Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for a small bit of rude humor.

‽
‽Avatar‽,‽With “Avatar” James Cameron has turned one man’s dream of the movies into a trippy joy ride about the end of life — our moviegoing life included — as we know it. Several decades in the dreaming and more than four years in the actual making, the movie is a song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an Emersonian exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with Cameronian rock ’em, sock ’em pulpy action. Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the movie — one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump — is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged. 
The story behind the story, including a production budget estimated to top $230 million, and Mr. Cameron’s future-shock ambitions for the medium have already begun to settle into myth (a process partly driven by the publicity, certainly). Every filmmaker is something of a visionary, just by virtue of the medium. But Mr. Cameron, who directed the megamelodrama “Titanic” and, more notably, several of the most influential science-fiction films of the past few decades (“The Terminator,” “Aliens” and “The Abyss”), is a filmmaker whose ambitions transcend a single movie or mere stories to embrace cinema as an art, as a social experience and a shamanistic ritual, one still capable of producing the big  WOW. 
The scale of his new movie, which brings you into a meticulous and brilliantly colored alien world for a fast 2 hours 46 minutes, factors into that wow. Its scope is evident in an early scene on a spaceship (the year is 2154), where the passengers, including a paraplegic ex-Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington, a gruffly sensitive heartthrob), are being roused from a yearslong sleep before landing on a distant inhabited moon, Pandora. Jake is woken by an attendant floating in zero gravity, one of many such aides. As Jake himself glides  through the bright cavernous space, you know you’re not in Kansas anymore, as someone soon quips (a nod to “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Cameron’s favorite film). You also know you’re not in the gloom of “The Matrix.” 
Though it’s easy to pigeonhole Mr. Cameron as a gear head who’s more interested in cool tools (which here include 3-D), he is, with “Avatar,” also making a credible attempt to create a paradigm shift in science-fiction cinema. Since it was first released in 1999, “The Matrix,” which owes a large debt to Mr. Cameron’s own science-fiction films as well as the literary subgenre of cyberpunk, has hung heavily over both SF and action filmmaking. Most films that crib from “The Matrix” tend to borrow only its slo-mo death waltzes and leather fetishism, keeping its nihilism while ditching the intellectual inquiries. Although “Avatar” delivers a late kick to the gut that might be seen as nihilistic (and how!), it is strangely utopian. 
It doesn’t take Jake long to feel the good vibes. Like Neo, the savior-hero of the “Matrix” series played by Keanu Reeves, Jake is himself an avatar because he’s both a special being and an embodiment of an idea, namely that of the hero’s journey. What initially makes Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part-alien, part-human body that he controls, like a puppeteer, from its head to its prehensile tail. Like the rest of the human visitors who’ve made camp on Pandora, he has signed on with a corporation that’s intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium, a great whatsit  that is an emblem of humanity’s greed and folly. With his avatar, Jake will look just like one of the natives, the Na’vi, a new identity that gives the movie its plot turns and politics. 
The first part of Jake’s voyage — for this is, above all, a boy’s rocking adventure, if one populated by the usual tough Cameron chicks — takes him from a wheelchair into a 10-foot, blue-skinned Na’vi body. At once familiar and pleasingly exotic, the humanoid Na’vi come with supermodel dimensions (slender hips, a miniature-apple rear); long articulated digits, the better to grip with; and the slanted eyes and twitchy ears of a cat. (The gently curved stripes that line their blue skin, the color of twilight, bring to mind the markings on mackerel tabby cats.) For Jake his avatar, which he hooks into through sensors while lying in a remote pod in a semiconscious state, is at first a giddy novelty and then a means to liberation. 
Plugging into the avatar gives Jake an instant high, allowing him to run, leap and sift dirt through his toes, and freeing him from the constraints of his body. Although physically emancipated, he remains bound, contractually and existentially, to the base camp, where he works for the corporation’s top scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, amused and amusing), even while taking orders from its head of security, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a military man turned warrior for hire. A cartoon of masculinity, Quaritch strides around barking orders like some intransigent representation of American military might (or a bossy movie director). It’s a favorite Cameron type, and Mr. Lang, who until this year had long been grievously underemployed, tears into the role like a starved man gorging on steak. 
Mr. Cameron lays out the fundamentals of the narrative efficiently, grabbing you at once with one eye-popping detail after another and on occasion almost losing you with some of the comically broad dialogue. He’s a masterly storyteller if a rather less nimble prose writer. (He has sole script credit: this is personal filmmaking on an industrial scale.) Some of the clunkier lines (“Yeah, who’s bad,” Jake taunts a rhinolike creature he encounters) seem to have been written to placate those members of the Michael Bay demographic who might find themselves squirming at the story’s touchier, feelier elements, its ardent environmentalism and sincere love story, all of which kick in once Jake meets Neytiri, a female Na’vi (Zoë Saldana, seen only in slinky Na’vi form). 
Mr. Cameron has said that he started thinking about the alien universe that became Pandora and its galactic environs in “Avatar” back in the 1970s. He wrote a treatment in 1996, but the technologies he needed to turn his ideas into images didn’t exist until recently. New digital technologies gave him the necessary tools, including performance capture, which translates an actor’s physical movements into a computer-generated image (CGI). Until now, by far the most plausible character created in this manner has been slithery Gollum from Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” cycle. The exotic creatures in “Avatar,” which include an astonishment of undulating, flying, twitching and galloping organisms, don’t just crawl through the underbrush;  they thunder and shriek, yip and hiss, pointy teeth gleaming. 
The most important of these are the Na’vi, and while their movements can bring to mind old-fashioned stop-motion animation, their faces are a triumph of tech innovation, with tremors and twitches that make them immediately appealing and empathetic. By the time Neytiri ushers Jake into her world of wonders — a lush dreamscape filled with kaleidoscopic and bioluminescent flora and fauna, with pink jellyfishlike creatures that hang in the air and pleated orange flowers that snap shut like parasols — you are deep in the Na’vi-land. It’s a world that looks as if it had been created by someone who’s watched a lot of Jacques Cousteau television or, like Mr. Cameron, done a lot of diving. It’s also familiar because, like John Smith in “The New World,” Terrence Malick’s retelling of the Pocahontas story, Jake has discovered Eden. 
An Eden in three dimensions, that is. In keeping with his maximalist tendencies, Mr. Cameron has shot “Avatar” in 3-D (because many theaters are not equipped to show 3-D, the movie will also be shown  in the usual 2), an experiment that serves his material beautifully. This isn’t the 3-D of the 1950s or even contemporary films, those flicks that try to give you a virtual poke in the eye with flying spears. Rather Mr. Cameron uses 3-D to amplify the immersive experience of spectacle cinema. Instead of bringing you into the movie with the customary tricks, with a widescreen or even Imax image filled with sweeping landscapes and big action, he uses 3-D  seemingly to close the space between the audience and the screen. He brings the movie to you. 
After a few minutes the novelty of people and objects hovering above the row in front of you wears off, and you tend not to notice the 3-D, which speaks to the subtlety of its use and potential future applications. Mr. Cameron might like to play with high-tech gadgets, but he’s an old-fashioned filmmaker at heart, and he wants us to get as lost in his fictional paradise as Jake eventually does. On the face of it there might seem something absurd about a movie that asks you to thrill to a natural world made almost entirely out of zeroes and ones (and that feeds you an anticorporate line in a corporately financed entertainment). But one of the pleasures of the movies is that  they transport us, as Neytiri does with Jake, into imaginary realms, into Eden and over the rainbow to Oz. 
If the story of a paradise found and potentially lost feels resonant, it’s because “Avatar” is as much about our Earth as the universe that Mr. Cameron has invented. But the movie’s truer meaning is in the audacity of its filmmaking. 
Few films return us to the lost world of our first cinematic experiences, to that magical moment when movies really were bigger than life (instead of iPhone size), if only because we were children. Movies rarely carry us away, few even try. They entertain and instruct and sometimes enlighten. Some attempt to overwhelm us, but their efforts are usually a matter of volume. What’s often missing is awe, something Mr. Cameron has, after an absence from Hollywood, returned to the screen with a vengeance. He hasn’t changed cinema, but with blue people and pink blooms he has confirmed its wonder. 
“Avatar” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun and explosive violence, death and despair.

‽
‽Nine‽,‽“My husband makes movies,” sings Marion Cotillard, with upswept Audrey Hepburn hair and an air of resignation. We’ll have to take her word for it, since the husband in question — played in a whirl of smoking, shrugging and bravura suit wearing by Daniel Day-Lewis — seems to be busily doing everything but that. His name is Guido, and while his co-workers and admirers call him Maestro, his mastery is purely notional. He made some great films in the past, apparently, but now, in Rome in the mid-1960s, he finds himself in a professional and personal tailspin just as his new project, the vague-sounding epic  “Italia,” is about to commence shooting. 
“I can’t make this movie,” he sings. Substitute “watch” for “make” and provide your own music. “Nine,” directed by Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Memoirs of a Geisha”) from the Broadway musical  (first staged in 1982 and revived in 2003), is a movie about creative blockage and sexual confusion, but not quite in the way it wants to be. Straining to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos, less a homage to Federico Fellini’s “8 ½” (its putative inspiration) than a travesty. 
The theatrical version was built around a single set — half soundstage, half cathouse — and a handful of musically serviceable, lyrically grueling songs by Maury Yeston. The movie, written by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella, who died in 2008, adds some new numbers and opens up the scenery and the story, taking Guido and his women into the streets of Rome, to a spa on the coast nearby and into flashbacks evocative of other Fellini movies. Mr. Marshall even touches down at Cinecittà’s Studio 5, where the real maestro plied his hectic trade. 
Occasionally a flicker of genuine style emerges from all this busy, gaudy fuss. Mr. Day-Lewis does not overdo the Italian-ness, and the sardonic smile playing around his mouth may be a sign of what he thinks of it all. Ms. Cotillard attains a measure of wounded dignity as Louisa, Guido’s former leading lady and much-betrayed wife. She is not spared the striptease obligations that fall to every other female character, but at least her big song is not splintered by the clumsy, mechanical cross-cutting that seems to be Mr. Marshall’s attempt to fuse choreographic energy with cinematic brio. 
None of the rest of Guido’s ladies are so lucky. It must be said that “Nine” is an impressive feat of casting, with a shocking number of Oscar winners and nominees assembled in the service of its dubious and incoherent cause. Judi Dench is Guido’s costume designer and confidante. Penélope Cruz is his mistress, Carla, a married woman with serious mascara issues. Nicole Kidman is a Nordic actress meant to conjure memories of Anita Ekberg, though sadly she does not walk around with a kitten on her head. Sophia Loren is Guido’s Mamma, and  Kate Hudson is a Vogue reporter who flings herself in his direction. 
Stacy Ferguson, known to pop-music fans as Fergie,  is Saraghina, the village prostitute who provides the boy Guido with a glimpse of forbidden pleasures. Nice for him. The rest of us watch Ms. Ferguson  stomp and gyrate through a number called “Be Italian,” which, like so much else in “Nine,” resembles a spread in a Victoria’s Secret catalog, only less tasteful. Ms. Hudson, for her part, struts through an embarrassing hymn to “Cinema Italiano” — with inane lyrics about “hip coffee bars” and Guido’s “neo-realism” — that recalls not Visconti or Antonioni (or even the Italian sex farces of the 1970s) but rather those lubricious Berlusconi-esque variety shows that baffle and titillate visitors from other countries who turn on their hotel-room television sets. 
Those spectacles at least come by their sleaze honestly. “Nine” dresses up its coarseness  in bogus  prestige, which both kills the fun and exposes an emptiness at the project’s heart — a fatal lack of inspiration. The fear of such a void is what animates the Guido character played by Marcello Mastroianni in “8 ½,” a man whose vanity, tenderness and narcissism mirrored Fellini’s own, and whose anxiety at the prospect of failing as an artist and a man made him a vivid and credible hero. That psychological dimension is missing from “Nine,” which never finds a way to communicate either the romantic ardor or the artistic passion that would make Mr. Day-Lewis’s Guido interesting. 
Instead he just comes off as a jerk, a compulsive liar and seeker of attention — and, in spite of the sports cars, the cigarettes and the occasional run-in with the Roman Catholic Church, not really very Italian at all. The best that can be said about “Nine” is that its affections are sincere, though you could say the same about its hero, who has the misfortune of being in a movie that’s an even worse mess than he is. 
“Nine” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Lingerie and cigarettes, but no real heat.

‽
‽Did You Hear About the Morgans?‽,‽There are barely enough titter-worthy one-liners in Marc Lawrence’s good-natured romantic comedy “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” to prevent it from sinking under the weight of its clichés. Most of the throwaway witticisms drop from the pursed lips of Hugh Grant, playing Paul Morgan, a New York lawyer with Oxonian airs reluctantly transplanted to a tiny Wyoming town as part of the federal witness protection program. 
After he and his wife, Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker), a high-end New York real-estate broker, accidentally see the murder of an international arms dealer and are spotted by the killer (Michael Kelly), they have no choice but to be whisked away to cowboy country under the pseudonyms Paul and Meryl Foster. Their hosts, the laconic, growly voiced United States Marshal Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott) and his rootin’-tootin’ cowgirl wife, Emma (Mary Steenburgen), teach the effete city slickers the simpler, more wholesome ways of the West. They also show these spoiled, high-maintenance neurotics how to have a relationship. Their secret? Just shut up and make it work! 
The sleeping arrangements in the Morgans’ temporary refuge are dicey because of one major complication: Paul and Meryl have separated. Meryl won’t forgive her husband for a one-night stand, despite his pleading and groveling to be taken back. As she harangues him about his breach of trust, you are acutely aware that the shelf life of Carrie Bradshaw and her knockoffs is on the verge of expiration. Despite Ms. Parker’s strenuous efforts to charm, Meryl comes across as a shrill, self-centered middle-aged nag. Behavior that appeared kooky and cute at 34 seems pathologically immature a decade later. 
Mr. Grant is more at ease, possibly because of his previous association with Mr. Lawrence, who wrote and directed “Music and Lyrics” and “Two Weeks  Notice,” in which Mr. Grant also starred. In the work of Mr. Lawrence, whose other credits include collaborating on the screenplays of the two “Miss Congeniality” films, you know what you’re getting: comedy with mostly likable, broadly drawn characters; tart, nonthreatening social satire with sharp enough teeth to leave an impression while not breaking the skin; and well-timed, modestly sophisticated repartee. 
In plunking upscale blue-state urbanites into red-state territory, “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” adroitly avoids condescending to either side. The movie’s sole political reference is its mention of the 14 Democrats in the overwhelmingly Republican town. That statistic is dropped by Wilford Brimley, playing a grouchy geezer at a local cafe who takes offense when Meryl asks him to direct his cigarette smoke away from her table. “We’re not fond of city people telling us how to live,” he grumbles. 
Once in Wyoming, Meryl, a vegetarian and a member of PETA, finds herself surrounded by stuffed animal heads in a house whose refrigerator is crammed with meat. 
Emma, a whiz with a shotgun and an ax, jokes that for her the acronym stands for People Eating Tasty Animals. 
Wyoming nights are so quiet that Paul remarks, “I thought I heard my cells dividing.” Consuming a hearty breakfast of bacon, eggs and pancakes makes him worry that he should have an angiogram. He is pathetically inept at chopping wood. The kickback from shooting a gun sends him to the doctor. Such jokes come with enough regularity that just as the movie seems about to fall asleep, a mild comic jolt wakes it up. 
“Did You Hear About the Morgans?” belongs more to the Wheelers than to its title characters. Mr. Elliott, 65, is everybody’s senior-cowboy fantasy: the Marlboro man three decades later, still oozing laid-back virility. Ms. Steenburgen’s Emma suggests an older, wiser, more grounded Sarah Palin type, comfortable in her skin and her Western gear. 
“Did You Hear About the Morgans?” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

‽
‽Ricky‽,‽There is no indication in the early scenes of François Ozon’s “Ricky” that the movie, which begins as a harshly realistic portrait of working-class parenthood in the gritty mode of a Dardenne brothers film, will turn into a magical-realist fable. Even after its metamorphosis, its notion of a baby who  sprouts wings and flies is no cutesy Disney fantasy of an infant Superman confidently zooming hither and yon. Like a moth involuntarily drawn to the light, Ricky (Arthur Peyret), the child of Katie (Alexandra Lamy) and Paco (Sergi Lopez), both highly stressed assembly-line workers in a French cosmetics factory, bumps into walls, hurls himself at windows and is in continual peril. 
Even for a filmmaker as gifted as Mr. Ozon (“Swimming Pool,” “Under the Sand”), the transition from one style to another a third of the way into the movie is almost impossible to carry off seamlessly. But that may be the point. Even in the happiest families, parenthood, for all its joys, brings no end of anxiety and unwelcome surprise. No child is exactly like any other. For all the rules that have been laid down, child rearing is still largely a matter of playing it by ear. 
As the movie, freely adapted from “Moth,” a short story by Rose Tremain, set in an American trailer park, rubs its genres together, it creates a sense of discomfort. In the first part, the equilibrium of a family of two — Katie and her 7-year-old daughter, Lisa (Mélusine Mayance) — is disturbed when Paco, the gruff, good-hearted Spaniard with whom Katie first hooks up in a factory lavatory, moves into their apartment in a housing project. 
The movie becomes a microscopic examination of shifting family dynamics with the birth of their child, Ricky, a noisy, demanding boy who takes attention away from Lisa, who in one scene is shown secretly clipping his wings. The camera stares fixedly at the visceral side of infancy, the baby suckling and soiling himself, the biological mother-child bond, the father’s sleeplessness and irritation, the sibling rivalry and the underlying parental fears for the baby’s safety. Where most films about children coo, giggle and turn misty-eyed, “Ricky” is pointedly unromantic. 
The first signs of the wings that will sprout from Ricky’s shoulder blades are what appear to be bruises, which Katie notices after leaving him in Paco’s care. Your heart sinks when she accuses him of abusing the child; he denies it and stalks out of the house. 
The wings that grow are not snowy angel’s wings but birdlike appendages, much like the bony chicken wings that are Lisa’s favorite part of the fowl when a roast is served. After Ricky is discovered perched high on a shelf, a blanket is put over his crib to keep him safe. But his drive to be airborne is unstoppable. He becomes a public curiosity after Katie takes him to a supermarket,  and he breaks free to career wildly among the fluorescent lights while the shoppers ogle him, and police officers, firefighters and television crews rush to the scene. 
At this point “Ricky” chooses to play down the unending media frenzy that would greet the phenomenon of a flying baby. One concerned, not terribly aggressive doctor who insists that Ricky needs special care is allowed to stand for the medical profession. 
The deeper “Ricky” plunges into allegory, the shakier its grasp of the material. Paco is eager to exploit Ricky for money and achieve a better life for the family. But having brought up the commercialization of Ricky, the movie abandons the issue. When Ricky flies away after Katie accidentally lets go of the string holding him during an outdoor television interview, the film disappears with him.

‽
‽Invictus‽,‽It may not seem obvious at first, but Clint Eastwood’s “Invictus,” a rousing true story of athletic triumph, is also that director’s latest exploration of revenge, the defining theme of his career. It is hard to think of an actor or a filmmaker who so cleanly embodies a single human impulse in the way that Mr. Eastwood — from “Pale Rider” to “Mystic River,” from Dirty Harry to “Gran Torino” — personifies the urge to get even. 
He has also, of course, taken a critical view of the drive for vengeance, investigating its tragic roots and terrible consequences. A movie like “Unforgiven,” most famously, suggests that violent revenge is regrettable. But rarely, in the world of Mr. Eastwood’s films, is it avoidable. 
“Invictus” is to some degree an exception, a movie about reconciliation and forgiveness — about the opposite of revenge — that gains moral authority precisely because the possibility of bloodshed casts its shadow everywhere. The film, based on John Carlin’s book “Playing the Enemy,” takes place in South Africa in the mid-1990s, just after Nelson Mandela’s election as the country’s first black president. Many of the whites in the film —  most of them Afrikaner nationalists still attached to a system that kept their black compatriots poor, disenfranchised and oppressed  —  brace themselves for payback as  Mandela assumes power. Quite a few of the president’s black supporters expect it, too, as their due after decades of brutality and humiliation under apartheid. 
But Mandela, played with gravity, grace and a crucial spark of mischief by Morgan Freeman, knows that score-settling would be a disastrous course for a new and fragile democracy. Passing by a newsstand on the morning after his victory, he spots a headline in Afrikaans. He has shown that he can win an election, it says, but will he show that he can govern? His bodyguards bristle at a pre-emptive low blow from a hostile press, but Mandela shrugs. “It’s a fair question,” he says. 
And a perennially urgent one in any democracy. Mr. Eastwood and the screenwriter, Anthony Peckham, are too absorbed in the details of the story at hand to suggest historical analogies, but “Invictus” has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss. It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership. 
But much of the ingenuity in Mr. Freeman’s performance lies in the way he conveys that idealism and the shrewd manipulation of symbols and emotions are not incompatible, but complementary. Taking power a few years after being released from 27 years of incarceration, Mandela is already a larger-than-life figure, an idol in South Africa and around the world. His celebrity is something of a burden, and also an asset he must learn to use; his moral prestige is a political weapon. 
But he is preoccupied, to the dismay of loyalists in his movement, with finding some kind of concord — not friendship, necessarily, but at least a state of non-enmity — with the people who hate and fear him: the whites who see him as a terrorist, a usurper and a threat to their traditions and values. Mandela’s overtures to the Afrikaners — starting with his refusal to dismiss white members of the presidential staff and security detail — arise partly out of Gandhian principle, and partly out of political calculation. They are a powerful force in the army, the police and the South African economy. 
Mandela’s aides — in particular Brenda Mazibuko (Adjoa Andoh) — are baffled when he takes up the cause of the South African rugby team, a symbol of stiff-necked Afrikaner pride despised by most blacks. The team’s Springbok mascot, named for a kind of gazelle, and its green-and-gold uniforms are nearly as loathsome as the apartheid flag, and when Mandela insists that the colors be retained, it seems almost like a betrayal of his life’s cause. South Africa, a pariah in the world of international sports for a long time (“the skunk of the world,” as Mandela puts it), is preparing to host the Rugby World Cup, and Mandela decides that if the nation is to find unity and self-respect the underachieving Springboks must win the championship. 
And so an alliance develops between the president and François Pienaar, the Springbok captain, played with crisp, disciplined understatement (and utter mastery of a devilishly tricky accent) by Matt Damon. Pienaar’s struggle to keep control of his team, and also to persuade them to accept some perplexing new social realities, is a microcosm of Mandela’s larger project. And he quietly accepts Mandela, who shares with Pienaar the Victorian poem that gives the movie its title, as a mentor. 
Beyond the politician, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Eastwood allow us glimpses of a complicated and somewhat melancholy man, carrying the loneliness of his long imprisonment with him and estranged from much of his family. He is gracious and charming in small groups, a stiff but compelling public speaker and a boss whose authority is buttressed by a phalanx of devoted, sometimes skeptical aides. 
But if “Invictus” is predominantly an absorbing character study of one of the most extraordinary characters of our time, it is also fleshed out with well-sketched minor players and subplots that illuminate the progress of racial rapprochement in its comic human dimension. The black bodyguards and their white colleagues proceed from hostility to wary tolerance to guarded warmth in a way that is pointed without being overstated. And that, for the most part, characterizes Mr. Eastwood’s direction, which is always unassuming, unhurried and efficient. In this film he tells a big story through a series of small, well-observed moments, and tells it in his usual blunt, matter-of-fact way, letting the nuances take care of themselves. 
And once again, as in “Letters From Iwo Jima” — a tragic rather than heroic inquiry into the nature of leadership — they do. “Invictus” is more sprawling than that film, and more willing to  risk hokiness. That is a chance Mr. Eastwood is often happy to take, and no genre is more susceptible to it (or earns it more honestly) than the victorious-underdog team-sports movie. That the sport is as alien to most Americans as it is to black South Africans presents its challenges, but by the end you might care about rugby more than you thought you would, even if it remains harder to understand than politics. 
The convergence of the two provides an occasion for some potent, intelligent filmmaking — a movie that hits you squarely with its visceral impact and stays in your mind for a long time after. 
“Invictus” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing, the threat of violence and brutal sports action. 
INVICTUS 
Opens on Friday nationwide.  
Directed by Clint Eastwood; written by Anthony Peckham, based on the book “Playing the Enemy” by John Carlin; director of photography, Tom Stern; edited by Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach; music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens; production designer, James J. Murakami; produced by Mr.  Eastwood, Lori McCreary, Robert Lorenz and Mace Neufeld; released by Warner Brothers Pictures. Running time: 2 hours 14 minutes. WITH: Morgan Freeman (Nelson Mandela), Matt Damon (François Pienaar) and Adjoa Andoh (Brenda Mazibuko).

‽Hannah Free‽,‽In “Hannah Free,” a clanking, sudsy tear-jerker about longtime lesbian lovers languishing in the same Michigan nursing home in the 1990s, Sharon Gless plays Hannah, a cantankerous resident prevented by the staff from visiting her partner, Rachel, who lies in a coma after a stroke. 
But Ms. Gless, 66, is much too young and vital to be playing a character who is probably 20 years older (Hannah and Rachel were childhood friends in the 1920s, before Rachel married and had children.) Her broad, hammy portrayal of a free-spirited butch lesbian bridling against authority conveys the same punchy heartiness she brought to Debbie Novotny, the mother of a gay son in “Queer as Folk.” 
The movie, directed by Wendy Jo Carlton, began life as a play by Claudia Allen, who adapted it for the screen. Scenes in which Hannah converses at length with the younger incarnation of Rachel (Ann Hagemann) make no attempt to disguise their origins on the stage. 
In flashbacks, Rachel, already a widow, continually berates the younger Hannah (Kelli Strickland) for repeatedly leaving to see the world. Rachel is happy to stay in the same small Michigan town where the two women grew up amid raised eyebrows and whispers. 
“Hannah Free” is what used to be called a problem play. The issues it addresses include the condescending treatment of the elderly and Christian proselytizing to the bedridden, the generational divide in attitudes toward homosexuality, the attempts of strait-laced family members to freeze out a same-sex partner at the end of life, and the final decisions for patients on life support. 
An angelic rescuer appears in the person of Rachel’s great-granddaughter Greta (Jacqui Jackson), who helps Hannah defy the rules laid down by Rachel’s puritanical daughter Marge (Taylor Miller). Greta represents an enlightened younger generation for whom sexual orientation is no big deal. 
HANNAH FREE

‽Transylmania‽,‽“Transylmania,” a vampire-hunter, college road trip sex comedy, has a problem: someone has drained all the laughs out of it. It’s destined to spend a short and painful life in theaters and then join the ranks of the DVD and late-night-cable undead. 
The directors David and Scott Hillenbrand, who were  responsible for the National Lampoon “Dorm Daze” movies, and the screenwriters Patrick Casey and Joshua Miller  (known as Worm Miller) have stuffed this cabbage with doltish and buxom students, sadistic dwarfs, severed heads, serial vomiting, sheep testicles, a priest with Tourette’s syndrome and horse flatulence. (That’s a “Young Frankenstein” homage: the horses let loose whenever someone says the name of the Transylvanian university where the action is set.) The Romanian vampires and the actors playing the American undergrads are both, in their own ways, long in the tooth. 
The plot concerns vampire possession, mistaken identity, medieval sex techniques and the dangers of meeting Eastern European women online. (A tip: make sure you see her back before you buy the plane ticket.) It’s an excuse for a long series of jokes, almost none of which deliver. “Call me a nurse while you’re at it,” an impaled student tells a dishy vampire hunter. 
“O.K., you’re a nurse,” she replies. That’s actually one of the funnier moments in the film, along with a truly tasteless bit involving Siegfried, Roy and a tiger puppet. Beyond that, the only things to look forward to are the snippets of “Bad Moon Rising” on the soundtrack. 
“Transylmania” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Female breasts and male buttocks.

‽
‽Armored‽,‽“There’s no bad guys here,” says Matt Dillon early in “Armored,” a blunt and unpretentious action thriller too unassuming to show itself in advance to critics. Since the trailers have promised mayhem, and since this is Mr. Dillon in his whispery, hollow-cheeked, sinister mode, we have reason to doubt his word. And sure enough, before too long the guns come out, and what was supposed to be a clean, bloodless crime turns foul and messy. 
But Mr. Dillon’s character, an armored-truck guard named Mike Cochrane, is not entirely off base. He and his colleagues, who plan to steal $42 million from one of their company’s vehicles, are not the kind of evil geniuses who usually plot and scheme in a movie like this. They are, all in all, fairly ordinary guys, just desperate and dumb enough to turn mean when things go wrong. 
In addition to Cochrane, the senior members of this miscreant crew are Quinn (Jean Reno), a cool customer, and Baines (Laurence Fishburne), a boisterous hothead. There is also a nervous,  skinny guy named Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich) and a brooding Bible reader named Palmer (Amaury Nolasco). 
The weak link, the pivot on which the story turns — and the mostly good guy who needs Cochrane’s reassurance that they aren’t bad guys — is Ty Hackett (Columbus Short), whose troubles make it hard for him to say no to the prospect of easy money. An Iraq veteran with a shoulder full of scar tissue, a younger brother to care for (their parents are dead) and a battered house that the bank is threatening to seize, he reluctantly goes along with the heist and immediately comes to regret his decision. 
“Armored,” from a script by the first-timer James V. Simpson, was directed by Nimrod Antal,  whose interest in working men and their vehicles was demonstrated in his debut film, the Hungarian-language “Kontroll,” about Budapest subway workers.  It is blessedly short, simple and sincere, with no great ambitions to pursue or statements to make. 
The norm in the crime-and-violence genre is bloated, cruel, empty nonsense like “Law-Abiding Citizen.”  “Armored” not only has a lower body count, but it is also in possession of a conscience and a soul, like Ty, its battered hero. The movie makes you feel the weight of the greed and brutality it depicts, and it does not take killing lightly. 
Ty’s circumstances resonate because they are the picture’s premise rather than its point, just as the abandoned factory where much of the action takes place is a mute emblem of industrial decline and economic blight. When one of the robbers sees the bundles of fresh cash, he leans down and inhales deeply, describing what he smells as “freedom.” 
He’s not joking, and there is something very sad at the core of “Armored,” a bleakness captured in the cinematography of Andrzej Sekula (whose other credits include “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction”). This is decidedly not an earnest, award-soliciting drama about a soldier’s return or a working-class family facing foreclosure, but it incorporates some hard facts of contemporary life with quiet passion and conviction. 
Not to worry, though; there is plenty of noise. Mr. Antal, classically trained at the Hungarian Academy of Drama and Film, has an old-fashioned, functional style. He knows how to crash a truck, and also how to build tension out of elemental situations and economical camera movements. He has made an unabashed B movie: basic, brutal and sometimes clumsy, but far from dumb, and not bad at all. 
“Armored” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Fairly restrained language and violence, given the story.

‽
‽Leonard Cohen: Bird on a Wire‽,‽The brilliant poet, novelist, musician and singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, who died in November at 82, became a superstar as a senior. He brought his earnest voice and moody guitar into the 1960s counterculture when he was in his early 30s, and he made a substantial impact musically well into the 1970s. In that time, he was a cult artist on a very large scale, so to speak. But after the explosive popularity of his oft-covered 1984 song, “Hallelujah,” and a management swindle that obliged him to become a road dog to restore his income, he became an arena-filling legend and, to his hard-core fans, a prophet. 
Mr. Palmer captures all this with a keen eye. The movie is a worthy time capsule and a must for Cohen devotees. Its occasional meanderings into artiness, which take the form of interpolation of outside footage (war atrocities and home movies, mainly) are emblematic of the time it was made and mercifully brief. 
‽
‽General Orders No. 9‽,‽“General Orders No. 9” is a tone poem laid over 72 minutes’ worth of images, many of them lovely, and is, as its press material says, “unlike any film you have ever seen.” The concept seems bold on first look, but if you stop and break down the ideas that Robert Persons, the writer and director, seems to be presenting, they’re actually rather retro. 
Mr. Persons has written a poem (William Davidson is the narrator) centered on Georgia, looking back to when it was pristine landscape unmolested by people. He spends a good deal of time serving up pastoral images, making generous use of cross-dissolves, and you begin to think this is a mere ode to nature. 
But about 27 minutes in, an interloper shows up: the highway. “The interstate does not serve, it possesses,” the poem says. “It has the power to make the land invisible to our attention.” 
Then Mr. Persons makes his way from rural to urban landscape, and he’s not happy about it. “The city is not a place, it’s a thing,” the poem says. “It has none of the marks of a place, but all of those of a machine.” 
Yet the urban images he presents are missing the thing that makes any city come alive: human beings. You begin to suspect that Mr. Persons hates humanity. This makes “General Orders No. 9,” for all its sheen of sophistication, rather simplistic: people bad, nature good. 
GENERAL ORDERS NO. 9 
Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.

‽
‽Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?‽,‽Answering its own question, Taggart Siegel’s revelatory documentary “Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?” would like us to know that its fuzzy subjects are starving, sick and stressed out. Examining the alarming phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder, Mr. Siegel buzzes around the globe and deep into the hive; what he finds is an insect done in by human insult. 
“Their crisis is our crisis,” an organic beekeeper says. (One of the film’s frequent surprises is that there are almost as many species of beekeeper as honeybee.) Because nearly half of our food production depends on bee pollination, the fate of this 100 million-year-old insect is intimately linked to our own. And with millions of bee colonies already lost in America alone, the dire predictions of Rudolf Steiner seem about to be fulfilled. 
Pointing the finger at pesticides, single-crop farming (requiring that the tiny creatures be forcibly shuttled around the country for pollination) and the industrialization of beekeeping itself (including inbreeding and injections of high-fructose corn syrup), “Queen of the Sun” offers a glimpse into imminent beepocalypse. 
But Mr. Siegel is no Cassandra: retaining the waggish tone of his previous documentary, “The Real Dirt on Farmer John” (released in 2007), he balances the doom-talking heads with cute animation and characters like Yvon Achard, a French “bee historian” who caresses the swarm with his elaborately styled facial hair. 
“They like!” he announces gleefully, though it’s difficult to tell. What is clear, though — thanks to the film’s tropically saturated cinematography and crystalline lighting — is that their honey has never looked so delicious. Or so precious.

‽
‽Hadewijch‽,‽Bruno Dumont’s austere, grimly luminous film “Hadewijch” takes its title from the name of a 13th-century poet, Hadewijch of Antwerp, whose work “The Paradoxes of Love” describes the agony and ecstasy of her 21st-century French namesake. A virginal 20-year-old theology student who is first seen in a monastery where she is preparing to take her vows, Hadewijch, as she is called by the nuns, spends much of her time on her knees, praying before a cross on the wall above her bunk bed in a bare, cell-like room. 
Refusing to eat or to dress for the cold, she is so fanatically devout that the Mother Superior takes her aside, sternly admonishes her for her “self-love,” describes her as “a caricature of a nun” and expels her from the convent until she has more experience in the world. In tears, Hadewijch, whose secular name is Céline, returns to Paris, where she lives with her parents —  a cabinet minister she describes as “a jerk” and his wife —  in chilly, palatial splendor. 
The film is a profound exploration of the paradoxes described in the poem, as experienced by Céline (Julie Sokolowski), who struggles to resolve her simultaneous sense of intimate connection with God and infinite distance from him. In the lines from Mother Columba Hart’s translation of the poem, which accompanies the production notes, “Her despair is assurance;/Her sorest wounding is all curing.” 
The film repeatedly seeks to evoke that contradictory sense of connection and alienation, not only in fervent Christianity but also in Islam, and it examines how the relentless pursuit of ultimate faith drives people to violent acts that are public manifestations of self-mortification. 
Like all of Mr. Dumont’s films, “Hadewijch” conjures the strange electricity (you might call it auras) around people, as if peeling away an outer layer of reality. The movie studies faces and bodies to locate the essence of humanness, especially in the eyes, behind which it finds both bestial and spiritual impulses and locates a primal isolation, as well as a lurking violence. One long-held shot of Céline has the transfixing power of a psychic or spiritual X-ray in which you sense her entire being. 
This cosmic view of humanity is so harsh and penetrating that it allows for little if any humor. And viewers who are not on Mr. Dumont’s wavelength tend to dismiss his work as pretentious, glum and boring. Those who follow him, however, will find themselves in the rarefied territory of Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson and Carl Dreyer. 
Every shot in the movie is an exquisitely rendered tableau that conveys the mysteries of life as contemplated by Céline. A repeated image of a church atop a hill, seen from below, suggests the spiritual distance she must travel without ever reaching it: a lofty, faraway destination in a landscape whose very beauty awakens an ineffable longing. If “Hadewijch” is Mr. Dumont’s most overtly religious film, it is not pro-faith in any specific way, although the director clearly respects the religious impulse. 
Céline, having returned to secular life, is befriended by Yassine (Yassine Salime), a young Arab layabout who lives with his older brother, Nassir (Karl Sarafidis),  in the projects on the fringe of Paris. Her curiosity about Islam prompts Nassir to invite her to a discussion group on “the notion of the invisible,” and they embark on a protracted dialogue on religious faith in which Nassir speaks abstractly of violence and “the fight.” 
Typical of a film by Mr. Dumont, “Hadewijch” makes sudden leaps without filling in the details. After Céline rebuffs the advances of Yassine, who calls her “nuts,” Nassir becomes her spiritual mentor, and they travel to an unidentified Middle Eastern country (the sequence was filmed in Lebanon), where they arrive just after a bombing. Céline is shown having tea with the members of what appears to be a terrorist group and swearing to carry out some unspecified mission. Then she is back in France. 
Periodically, the movie focuses on David (David Dewaele), a gaunt young parolee working on the monastery property who observes Céline’s comings and goings. His presence remains mysterious until the very end, when he becomes an ambiguous redemptive symbol who “saves” Céline after she has committed two desperate acts. 
“Hadewijch” and the forthcoming “Of Gods and Men” (shown at this year’s New York Film Festival) suggest that for all the talk of France’s metamorphosis into a secular society, powerful religious and spiritual fires still burn there.

‽Gulliver's Travels‽,‽To: A. O. Scott 
From: Jonathan Swift  [stellasdude@gmail.com] 
Subj: Gulliver’s Travels 
Esteemed Sir: 
On my return from the recent shewing of “Gulliver’s Travels,” whereat I was sufficiently fortunate to pass a choice moment on the Red Carpet in the charming Company of Miss Emily Blunt, I find it politick to communicate with yourself on the topick of this Motion Picture. Surely I state what can only be apparent to any man not a Jackass when I observe that it bears little relation to my original Work. Perhaps you construe that my intent in this epistle is to thunder against a grievous misappropriation of my Book, but please be assured that I have no such complaint. An Apple is but an Apple, while an Orange is some other thing. 
Apples, it should be noted, figure prominently among the Products attractively displayed in the course of this Entertainment, which passes, if you will permit me to say so, Swiftly enough — not unlike a small, unvexing Kidney Stone. Much display is also made of other Intellectual Properties belonging, like “Gulliver’s Travels,” to The News Corporation, at whose Fox News Channel I have vainly sought a berth for many years, believing that my publick embrace of Conservative Principles and my long service to the Church might find preferment there. But no. Apparently I am viewed in those quarters as a Tory in Name Only, and an Elitist to boot. Nor have Mr. Colbert’s people replied to my earnest entreaties. 
But such unhappy Matters need not detain us here. Indulge, rather, my views on “Gulliver’s Travels,” which somewhat cleverly converts my great Satire into a gaudy, puerile Toy. My avowed purpose in composing that text, as any swot who has suffered the Duty and Dullness rampant in our Schools must know, was to employ my modest pen as a scourge against human Folly and the vanities of the Age. Having deemed itself unable to defeat those foes, this rendition of “Gulliver’s Travels” chuses rather to join them. 
The purveyors of the Amusement have superadded to the Spectacle a third dimension, the main Effect of which is to expand the already extensive Belly and Buttocks of Mr. Jack Black, a rotund Clown charged with the task of impersonating Lemuel Gulliver. My storied Voyager is thus converted to yet another fellow of slack Ambition and ample Gut, toiling at a Loser Job and pining for his Stella (or Darcy, as she is here called), a woman of quick Intellect and slender Frame, in whose League he is so totally not. Though of course we never are permitted to doubt that this Stella will smile upon him in the end, and do so moreover with the glorious and gleaming Teeth of Miss Amanda Peet. 
Only a few of the true Gulliver’s journeys, to Lilliput and, briefly, to the land of the Brobdingnags, fall within the narrow Compass of this Narrative, which has been transported from my Time to yours. Withal, the Lilliputians are, in some wise, much as I had envisioned them — tiny creatures, indeed, but also proud and ingenious. They are ruled by the noted comickal personage Billy Connolly, whose daughter the Princess is portrayed by the fetching Miss Blunt, upon whom your correspondent must confess he has no inconsiderable Crush. So too, and more to the point of the tale, do the arrogant Soldier embodied by Chris O’Dowd and a local fellow of slack Ambition, etc., etc., performed by Jason Segel. Perhaps you wish to venture a prophecy as to which of them will, at the last, receive the favor of the Princess. 
Now, my good Sir, I hope I do not err in venturing a Comparison. Perhaps you are familiar with “Night at the Museum”? Indeed, I observe that you have offered learned Commentary on its second Episode, “Battle of the Smithsonian” — though I confess that I was unable to discern from your Prose whether it met with your full Approbation. To put the matter briefly: This is more or less like That (which also issued from the mighty hand of The News Corporation) insofar as it offers agreeable Novelties and inoffensive jests. 
For myself, I was but seldom inspired to peals of true laughter, though I did relish that part when Mr. Black, confronting a fire raging in the Palace of Lilliput, douses the blaze through heroic use of such means as Nature has provided him. This was, indeed, the only moment at which it seemed that the temperament of the Picture corresponded, in some degree, to my own. 
To grumble further would be, as the saying goes, akin to pointing my Water toward the Wind. I note that Mr. Black has, in other endeavors, proved himself a Mocker after my own heart, but I can hardly begrudge him the greater emolument that issues from cavorting in the mildly naughty manner of an overgrown tot. I can further suppose that a Child of average Wit or even moderate Dullness — a boy of Nine, let us say, who can be coaxed away from the Wii of a Christmas afternoon — might pass a pleasant interval chuckling at the absurd incongruities that arise when something very large is placed beside something very small. Nor will this notional child’s elder companion be subject to inordinate Anguish, much as he might wish himself in the place of those unencumbered souls thronging the adjacent Room to see “True Grit.” 
As for your correspondent, since a further encounter with the charming Miss Blunt seems altogether improbable, I will decline to undertake a second voyage to “Gulliver’s Travels,” chusing instead to devote myself to the preparation of my customary Holiday Feast, a delectable Stew made from the flesh of Irish Babies. (JK! ROTFL!) 
I remain, Sir, your most hmble &amp; obdt svt,J. Swift. 
Post Scriptum: It is suggested that children attend this Motion Picture under the Guidance of Parents, as a few mild oaths are uttered, and the humor is at moments more Salty than Sweet.

‽
‽Secret Sunshine‽,‽“Secret Sunshine” — a 2007 film by Lee Chang-dong now making a tardy but welcome American debut — takes place in a South Korean town called Miryang, described by one of its residents  as “just like every other place.” This is true enough, and Mr. Lee is certainly attentive to the routines and rhythms of everyday life. But there is nothing ordinary about this movie, or about the story it tells. 
On its surface the transparent and horrifying tale of a mother’s grief, “Secret Sunshine” has the kind of emotional depth and thematic complexity that rewards repeat viewings. Mr. Lee, a distinguished novelist before he turned to filmmaking (he has also served as South Korea’s minister of culture and tourism), composes the cinematic equivalent of prose that is clear, elegant and lyrical. The experience of watching his films is not always pleasant: more than a few scenes in “Secret Sunshine” (and in the more recent, equally amazing “Poetry,” a highlight of this year’s New York Film Festival) are excruciating in their raw depiction of souls in torment. And yet his quiet and exacting humaneness infuses even the most dreadful moments with an intimation of grace. 
At its most literal, the title of “Secret Sunshine” refers to an old meaning of the word Miryang.   At the beginning of the movie, Lee Shin-ae (Jeon Do-yeon), recently widowed, moves to the town with her young son, Jun. Miryang was her husband’s  childhood home, but Shin-ae is nonetheless very much a stranger. Befriended by Kim Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), an amiable mechanic who tows her broken-down car into town, she goes about the business of making a new life for herself and Jun. She gives piano lessons, chats politely with local shopkeepers, and stoically endures the nosiness and coldness of some of the townspeople while cautiously welcoming the kindness of others. The place seems, for a while, to live up to its name, insofar as its warmth is not always immediately apparent. 
Then something happens that both upends Shin-ae’s fragile sense of control and turns the film from a quiet comedy of provincial life into a tour of parental hell. There are trailers online that make it pretty clear, and a cursory search of what has been written about “Secret Sunshine” since its premiere in Cannes more than three years ago will supply plenty of spoilers. But I’m still reluctant to say too much, since the full impact of this film is perhaps best experienced if its shocks are uncushioned by foreknowledge. Shin-ae, after all, has no idea what horrors await her in Miryang, and Mr. Lee has a remarkable ability to refrain from foreshadowing. The ribbon of his narrative bends and loops, but it does not twist. 
In the wake of tragedy, Shin-ae looks for solace in routine — scolding her recalcitrant students with renewed rigor — and then in religion. She begins attending revival meetings at a local evangelical church, embracing its gospel of boundless love and ready forgiveness. But further disappointments and devastations lie in store, as the film, without succumbing to glib cynicism, refuses any easy route toward comfort or redemption. 
How do you make a movie about an unbearable experience that is not itself unbearable? The answer will come close to a sturdy and time-tested definition of art, one job of which is to give intelligible and therefore consoling form to the agonies of human life. And therefore, also, to discern within the worst of what people can inflict and endure at least a hint of brighter possibilities. The title of “Secret Sunshine” thus becomes both its moral and a description of its curiously illuminating qualities. Conjuring a picture of absolute darkness, it nonetheless casts a beam of light. 
Some of this comes from Ms. Jeon, who started out on South Korean television and who deservedly won the award for best female performance in Cannes for this role. Shin-ae, though a victim of terrible and cosmically unfair circumstances, is not entirely innocent or sympathetic. But of course nobody really is, and the inconsistencies Ms. Jeon finds in her character’s personality are evidence of the coherence of her performance. There is nothing to do but believe in her. 
And yet the sheer, fearless intensity Ms. Jeon brings to “Secret Sunshine” would overwhelm the film were it not balanced by Mr. Song’s relaxed geniality.  Kim’s relentless pursuit of Shin-ae — always eager to help, he follows her everywhere she goes, including into the arms of the Lord — is sometimes creepy, sometimes pathetic, but it also provides her with a consistent and supportive human presence. Kim is described, in a conversation with one of his friends, as a character more at home in comedy than in melodrama, which describes his role in Shin-ae’s life, and Mr. Song’s in the film, almost too perfectly. 
To praise the perfection of “Secret Sunshine” would be to risk misrepresenting its main virtue, which is its attention to minor infelicities and inconveniences as well as to unspeakable crimes and intolerable heartaches. It is a great movie, by a major figure in world cinema.

‽
‽True Grit‽,‽That old-time American religion of vengeance runs like a river through “True Grit,” a comic-serious tale about some nasty, brutish times. Beautifully adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen from the parodic western novel by Charles Portis, it turns on a 14-year-old Arkansas girl who hires a “one-eyed fat man” to hunt down her father’s killer. First published in 1968, Mr. Portis’s tall tale was brought to the screen the next year custom-fitted for John Wayne, who rode the role of that fat man, Rooster Cogburn, straight to an Oscar. Now it’s the thinner scene-stealer Jeff Bridges who sits and sometimes drunkenly slumps in the saddle. 
Much as he did in the raucously entertaining original film directed by Henry Hathaway, Rooster enters on his best behavior, seated in a courtroom amid a fog of cigar smoke and conspicuous lies. The pale, ghostly light comes courtesy of the Coens’ frequent cinematographer, Roger Deakins, while many of the twisty, funny sentences have been plucked by the filmmakers right from the novel. A deputy United States marshal, Rooster has attracted the interest of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld, in a terrific film debut), a half-pint who, with her bloodlust and severely braided hair, is an authentic American Gothic. As she listens to Rooster recount his bloody deeds and high body count, her eyes shine with a true believer’s excitement. 
Avenging her father and keeping close track of her family’s expenses are what preoccupy Mattie, a richly conceived and written eccentric, as memorable on the page as she is now on screen. Softened for the first film (in which she was played by a  21-year-old Kim Darby, in a bob), she has been toughed up again by the Coens so that she resembles the seemingly humorless if often unintentionally humorous Scripture-quoting martinet of Mr. Portis’s imagination. At times she brings to mind D. H. Lawrence’s famed formulation that “the essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.” At other times, as when she wears her dead father’s oversize coat and hat, she looks like a foolish child left to perilous play. 
Those dangers are telegraphed early by the public hanging that occurs soon after the story opens. Mattie, along with a family worker, Yarnell (Roy Lee Jones), has traveled from her Yell County home to Fort Smith, Ark., to identify her father, who has been gunned down by another worker, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). After doing so, she sends Yarnell home and gets down to business, first by settling her father’s accounts. She then hires Rooster because she hears that he has “true grit,” a quality that mostly seems to entail a disregard for preserving the lives of his prisoners. It’s no wonder she watches the hanging with such avidity, and no wonder too that she takes off after Chaney, armed with Rooster and her father’s heavy gun. 
Their journey leads them into Indian country (with few Indians) and increasingly tense and violent encounters featuring corpses, severed fingers and a bad, bad man (Barry Pepper, spewing fear and spittle). On occasion a Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who calls himself LaBeef, joins in the search. Wearing jangling spurs and a luxurious mustache that sits on his lip like a spoiled Persian cat, LaBoeuf hopes to bag Chaney for a large reward. Dead or alive, everyone in this story — snaggletooth thief or boardinghouse owner — has a price either on his head or in mind, usually in the form of the dollars and cents one person hopes to extract from another. “Why do you think I am paying you,” Mattie asks Rooster, “if not to have my way?” 
The Coens deliver that line with a touch so light you might not even notice its sting. They have been surprisingly faithful to the tone and idiomatic tang of Mr. Portis’s novel, perhaps because its worldview suits their ironic purposes. The whiskey-soaked Rooster still likes to “pull a cork,” as he does in the book, and the Coens and Mr. Bridges get into the boozy spirit of things with slurs and pratfalls. 
Despite Mr. Bridges’s showy turn, the movie opens and closes with Mattie’s voice-over, which shifts the story away from Rooster and back to her. The Coens also restore the novel’s framing device: “True Grit” isn’t just the story of a gutsy 14-year-old; it is her story as called from the memory of the woman (Elizabeth Marvel) she became. 
The Coens opened their last film, “A Serious Man,” about a 1960s Minneapolis professor  who endures trials worthy of Job, with an enigmatic short story about  a 19th-century tale involving a possible dybbuk. That story is prefaced with a quotation attributed to the medieval Jewish scholar Rashi (“Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you”) that appears in a 19th-century comic story, “The Gilgul, or The Wandering Soul,” about a dybbuk, or restless spirit, that inhabits a person. In “True Grit” the Coens switch to Solomon, opening the film with the first half of Proverbs 28:1  (“The wicked flee when none pursueth”), a line Mattie quotes early in the novel. Like Mr. Portis, they notably omit the second line: “But the righteous are bold as a lion.” 
Mr. Portis’s book hit in 1968, in the midst of a pop-cultural cycle that, partly fueled by the Vietnam war, was revisiting the cowboy myth with degrees of cynicism and nostalgia. “True Grit” sticks to the western template, but with characters who, at least initially, fall far short of the heroic ideal of the type that Wayne himself embodied for decades. Yet no matter how roguish (and laughable) in the novel, Rooster can’t help registering as a larger-than-life hero on screen because the legend who played him, by then a survivor of cancer and countercultural assaults (for the jingoistic “Green Berets”), had played his role for so long. When Wayne won best actor for “True Grit,” it was for playing John Wayne. 
The first “True Grit” opened in New York in early July 1969,  a week after “The Wild Bunch,” the Sam Peckinpah western that’s widely seen as a metaphor about interventionist follies like Vietnam and that remains an enduring evisceration of the genre. The Coens, who like to play with genre, often with giggles and winks, haven’t mounted an assault on the western. But in Mattie they have created a character whose single-minded pursuit of vengeance has unmistakable resonance. In the first “True Grit,”  when Rooster watches Mattie cross a river on horseback, he jocularly says, “She reminds me of me.” The line isn’t in the remake, but from the long, hard look Rooster gives her now, it’s clear that she still does, for better and worse. 
In classic Coen style, the brothers punctuate the image of Mattie riding to dry ground with a cutaway to a slack-jawed Rooster, his mouth agape in wonder. By the time the scene ends, the mood has switched again, and Rooster has drawn his gun on LaBoeuf in deadly seriousness. (Mr. Damon plays the designated clown with grace, as Mr. Bridges slides between buffoonery and malice.) 
In some ways, much like Charles Laughton’s “Night of the Hunter,” which the Coens quote both musically and visually, “True Grit” is a parable about good and evil. Only here, the lines between the two are so blurred as to be indistinguishable, making this a true picture of how the West was won, or — depending on your view — lost. 
“True Grit” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Three severed digits and several holes to the head.

‽
‽Little Fockers‽,‽Apparently, because all the good jokes were used up in the first two “Fockers” movies, the wisenheimers behind the latest installment in this unnecessary trilogy decided to bring in some spew, opening a sick toddler’s mouth like a fire hydrant and letting it rip. 
The mortification of the body has always played a part in the “Fockers” franchise, which hinges on the uneasy, at times violently contentious relationship between a male nurse, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and his father-in-law, Jack (Robert De Niro), a former C.I.A. operative. But at their best and funniest, those mortifications were intrinsic to the story’s meaning. 
Part of what made the first movies work as well as they did — “Meet the Parents” hit in 2000,  and its sequel, “Meet the Fockers,” followed four years later  — was the cultural clash that dare not fully speak its name. Initially, the series only broadly winked at the reasons for Jack’s slow-burning tsuris. Was that a bagel in Greg’s pocket, or was he just glad to see his shiksa girlfriend and then wife, Pam (Teri Polo)? But when the second movie brought in Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman to play Greg’s parents, any residual anxiety about the characters’ nominal cultural differences gave way to the spectacle of two legends playfully batting around the Jewish stereotypes that the stars themselves struggled against and transcended. 
How do you top Ms. Streisand and Mr. Hoffman playing at being the happy, sexy hippie couple for easy jokes? You don’t. Apparently, you don’t even try, as is evident from the new movie’s lack of wit and surplus of lazy scenes. 
Directed by Paul Weitz (Jay Roach did better with the first two), “Little Fockers” reunites all the principal actors, this time to greatly diminished returns in a story that turns on Jack’s decision to anoint Greg the family patriarch. Time is passing, if not quickly enough in this movie, and fears of mortality are nipping at Jack’s heels and clutching at his heart. The ensuing tension — or rather, slackly stitched-together chain of misunderstandings — centers on whether Greg is worthy of this honor. 
Are we there yet? No, because first Jessica Alba has to show up and throw off her clothes and then her body at Mr. Stiller, a story line that has everything to do with his star muscle and nothing to do with Greg. This leads to some matrimonial static that draws the series closer to the kind of deadly dull domestic comedy that the “Fockers” franchise previously managed to avoid becoming. 
Exhaustion partly explains why, though it also seems clear that Mr. Stiller, who in the 10 years since the first “Fockers” has become a Hollywood powerhouse, isn’t interested in being the butt of anyone’s joke. Mr. De Niro might not mind making mincemeat of his own legacy, as a painful bit with a grinning Harvey Keitel suggests. (Somewhere, Martin Scorsese is lighting a votive candle.) But Mr. Stiller is no longer in a laughing mood. 
“Little Fockers” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The usual bodily liquids and penis jokes. 
LITTLE FOCKERS 
Opens on Wednesday  nationwide.  
Directed by Paul Weitz; written by John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey; director of photography, Remi Adefarasin; edited by Greg Hayden, Leslie Jones and Myron Kerstein; music by Stephen Trask; production design by William Arnold; costumes by Molly Maginnis; produced by Jane Rosenthal, Robert De Niro, Jay Roach and Mr. Hamburg; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes. 
WITH: Robert De Niro (Jack Byrnes), Ben Stiller (Greg Focker), Owen Wilson (Kevin Rawley), Blythe Danner (Dina Byrnes), Teri Polo (Pam Focker), Jessica Alba (Andi Garcia), Laura Dern (Prudence), Colin Baiocchi (Henry Focker), Daisy Tahan (Samantha Focker), Dustin Hoffman (Bernie Focker) and Barbra Streisand (Roz Focker). 
‽
‽Yogi Bear‽,‽There’s exactly one thing about the misbegotten big-screen “Yogi Bear” that might make you think back with any fondness to the Hanna-Barbera cartoons on which it’s based. That would be Justin Timberlake’s charming performance as the voice of Boo-Boo Bear, a fitting tribute to the original Boo Boo, Don Messick (who also voiced Scooby-Doo and the Jetsons’ dog, Astro). 
Otherwise this mostly live-action film is a bland 21st-century family comedy without a single moment that captures the wit, energy or sophistication of the original, which by now dates back more than 50 years. After some early picnic-basket stealing, the story expands into a battle to save Jellystone Park from loggers and corrupt politicians, with a romantic subplot involving Ranger Smith and a cute documentary maker. 
We’ve seen this kind of talking-animal ecological parable quite a few times already, and this one is so generic, it wouldn’t pass muster on Saturday-morning television. 
Dan Aykroyd gives a glum and largely personality-free reading of Yogi, while the human actors who signed on to fill the space around the computer-animated bears — including Tom Cavanagh as Ranger Smith, Anna Faris as the environmentally minded filmmaker and Andrew Daly as the nasty mayor — are pretty much helpless. 
It’s especially painful to watch Ms. Faris, so perversely funny in films like “Smiley Face” and “The House Bunny,” reduced to big smiles and false heartiness. 
The director, Eric Brevig, is a visual-effects specialist, and he and his crew have done an excellent job of integrating their animated bears into some majestic scenery (filmed in New Zealand).  
“Yogi Bear” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for jokes about marking territory and scratching backsides.

‽How Do You Know‽,‽In “How Do You Know,” a romantic comedy about missed opportunities, scripted and otherwise, Reese Witherspoon wears an industrial-strength smile and a laser twinkle that looks as if it’s set on kill. Although she’s routinely cast in frothy fare, Ms. Witherspoon comes with a hard, intimidating edge that most directors ignore. Maybe she prefers light and lovely over dark and dangerous. But as she showed in Alexander Payne’s 1999 comedy, “Election,” in which  she played a ferocious high-school climber in a dazzling performance that has hung over her career like an unmet dare, she can be a beautiful menace. 
In “How Do You Know,” an airless, sometimes distressingly mirthless comedy written and directed by James L. Brooks, Ms. Witherspoon plays Lisa, a softball player with world-class   aspirations who fails to make the cut, an unfortunate story line for a movie with the same problem. 
The bad news arrives not long into the movie, furnishing her with a potential existential dilemma — she’s a 31-year-old athlete without obvious prospects — that Mr. Brooks has little interest in exploring. So instead, he dries her tears and piles on the romantic complications, loading her with smiles and sighs, exits and entrances, and cramming this busy yet uneventful movie with the kind of laugh lines built for laugh tracks. 
Lisa’s romantic complications come in two flavors: vanilla and butterscotch. She almost samples the first, a pale, soft-serve businessman working in some vague capacity named George (Paul Rudd), after a mutual friend tries to hook them up. George has his own troubles, including a federal investigation and an overbearing father (an alarmingly unhealthy-looking and wheezing Jack Nicholson) who’s also his boss. 
George is a nice guy, or so the movie insists, again and again. By the time he calls her, Lisa already seems under the spell of Matty (Owen Wilson), a major-league pitcher with lots of dough and a softly cracked attitude toward life. So George strikes out and strikes out  again, though of course not for long. 
As it happens, Mr. Brooks has more predictable taste in men than his female characters do. Albert Brooks’s flop-sweating reporter might have been perfect for Holly Hunter’s motor-mouthed television producer in the filmmaker’s most successful comedy, “Broadcast News,” but it was William Hurt’s dry-look anchor who (temporarily) got the girl. Once again, Mr. Brooks (the filmmaker) tips the scales, mostly because he seems to have mistaken the appealing, featherweight Mr. Rudd for a romantic lead. Mr. Wilson might not have the seriousness (or self-seriousness) of a William Hurt, but he holds your interest with his idiosyncratic, off-rhythm charm and delivery. He’s a live wire, and when he’s onscreen the movie jumps. 
For the most part, though, it just sits there, idling in neutral, as lines are delivered and bodies listlessly moved. The generic quality of the title — yes, indeed, how does anyone know — extends to every other facet in the production. The three main characters talk and talk, save for one dinner of cutely enforced quiet between Lisa and George, and generally sound as if they just got out of therapy: they process rather than converse. Yet perhaps because Mr. Brooks doesn’t want to get too heavy, even when the story lists toward the weighty, much of the dialogue comes in tiny, epigrammatic bites not much bigger and certainly no deeper than the affirmations that Lisa has scribbled on Post-its and stuck on her bathroom mirror. 
“How Do You Know” is so wan and disconnected to anything that feels like real life or, just as good, a screwball interpretation of it that it’s hard to know what Mr. Brooks was really after, other than passing the time with some talented movie people. This lack of urgency and purpose proves toughest on Ms. Witherspoon, who, partly because she’s the strongest or most obviously determined actor in this little group, seems incapable of goofing her way through the movie. Mr. Rudd and Mr. Wilson have no such problem. Curiously, all three are outshone by a pair of character actors — Kathryn Hahn, who plays George’s secretary, Annie, and Lenny Venito, as her boyfriend — who, in an overworked, overwritten hospital scene, show you what love looks like simply by, surprise, good acting. 
“How Do You Know” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some naughty words. 
HOW DO YOU KNOW

Brooks; director of photography, Janusz Kaminski; edited by Richard Marks and Tracey Wadmore-Smith; music by Hans Zimmer; production design by Jeannine Oppewall; costumes by Shay Cunliffe; produced by Mr. Brooks, Julie Ansell, Paula Weinstein and Laurence Mark; released by Columbia Pictures.

‽
‽Mundane History‽,‽Merging astronomy, Buddhist philosophy, and political and social unrest, “Mundane History” may carry a modest title, but its ambitions are exactly the opposite. A simple, almost spare family drama told through strong, purposeful images, this first feature from the Thai director Anocha Suwichakornpong parallels the emotional dynamic of a single home with the tumult of an entire country. 
That home, a sprawling mansion with separate servants’ quarters, is both shelter and prison to Ake (Phakpoom Surapongsanurak), a recently paralyzed young man whose distant father (Paramej Noiam) barely speaks to him. Ake’s care has been entrusted to a diligent male nurse (Arkaney Cherkham) whose gratitude for the job is constantly tested by a patient seething with bitterness and a household whose occupants, he confides to his wife, seem “soulless.” In this airless, patriarchal fief, everyone except Ake knows his or her place. 
Focusing on the quotidian tasks of caregiving — the feeding and bathing, the necessary intimacies — Ms. Suwichakornpong sketches Ake’s gradual reconnection to life with scenes that swerve from prosaic to psychedelic. It’s not always clear what she’s up to (though at least one of her metaphors is screamingly literal), but her visual imagination and grip on atmosphere are consistently impressive. Scarcely less admirable is her ability to depict nongratuitous full-frontal nudity — a talent more than a few of her Hollywood colleagues could stand to learn.

‽
‽The Fighter‽,‽With the possible exception of the romantic comedy, no film genre is more strictly governed by conventions — or enslaved by clichés, if you prefer — than the boxing picture. Something similar might be said about reviews of boxing pictures, so here goes: 
“The Fighter,” directed by David O. Russell and based on the true story of the junior welterweight Micky Ward, is quick on its feet and packs a mighty punch. With solid bodywork, clever feints and tremendous heart, it scores at least a TKO, by which I mean both that it falls just short of overpowering greatness — I can’t quite exclaim, “It’s a knockout!” — and that the most impressive thing about it is technique. 
By the time this film — which was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson, and shepherded into existence by Mark Wahlberg, who plays Mr. Ward — reaches its rousing and brutal final rounds, it may feel a bit familiar. Not necessarily because the story of Mr. Ward’s career is so well known (his most famous bouts, in particular his three extraordinary meetings with Arturo Gatti in 2002 and 2003, do not fall within the movie’s scope), but rather because the shape of the narrative recalls so many other fight movies. This is yet another tale of an underdog battling long odds and stubborn adversity in search of a shot at the big time. 
It is also a love story, a family melodrama and the chronicle of a close and complicated fraternal relationship. The love of a good woman (the unaffectedly lovable Amy Adams), the rivalry and camaraderie between brothers, the battered face, bruised knuckles and wounded pride — “The Fighter” has it all. 
But the inevitable comparisons arise only in retrospect, when it settles down into the company of “Rocky” and “Raging Bull” and other very good (and Best Picture-nominated) boxing pictures. Mr. Russell, a restlessly — sometimes recklessly — inventive filmmaker, does not try to subvert the genre, but rather, as Clint Eastwood did in “Million Dollar Baby,” to refresh it, to find new insights and angles of vision within the parameters of the tried and true. 
Sticking fairly closely to the facts of Mr. Ward’s story, “The Fighter” also plants itself firmly in his native terrain of Lowell, Mass., immersing the viewer, especially in early scenes, in the sensorium of a hard-luck industrial town left to languish in the backwash of globalization. The voices of the citizens are angry, irreverent and profane. The light is flat and unlovely. You can almost smell the weariness and desperation rising off of the tar that Micky, in his day job as a road paver, spreads on streets lined with sagging three-decker houses and faded storefronts. A city with a distinguished place in American labor and literary history — it was the birthplace of Jack Kerouac — Lowell in the early 1990s, when “The Fighter” unfolds, is blighted by poverty, unemployment and the crack epidemic, which has claimed Micky’s half brother, Dicky Eklund, as a casualty. 
This last bit of information emerges piecemeal, through a scrim of family denial and addict  dissembling, but as soon as we see Dicky, played by a gaunt and antic Christian Bale, we know something is wrong. His eyes dart, his mouth draws back into a nervous rictus, and his shuffling, splayed walk conveys neurological damage. Dicky is also amusing, sensitive and quick witted, a ball of comic charm able, just barely, to juggle his addiction with his commitment to his brother and their mother, Alice (Melissa Leo). 
Mr. Bale’s performance is astonishing, in part because he so completely conquers a daunting set of physical and psychological challenges. Dicky is not only an addict but also an athlete in his own right, a former boxer who clings to, and endlessly relives, a single moment of glory. He tells everyone who will listen that he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, and while the facts of the episode are in dispute, his pugilistic skill and intelligence are never in doubt. 
In a crucial scene, having attempted a remarkably stupid caper, he finds himself fleeing the Lowell police, his long limbs flapping like a cartoon character’s as he high-tails it down the street. Then, as Dicky stops and squares off to throw an ill-advised punch, he snaps suddenly from clown to gladiator. You see that his core of talent and discipline has not been completely destroyed by drugs, even if his judgment and self-respect have. You also see that this funny, exasperating character is really a walking, flailing tragedy, for himself and just about everyone around him. 
It is this rhythm — the light, syncopated footwork of comedy setting up stinging jabs of pathos — that makes “The Fighter” so lively, so surprising and so moving. At least since “Flirting With Disaster,” his breakthrough comedy from 1996, Mr. Russell has exhibited a bracingly kinetic directing style, for better and for worse: “Three Kings” flies like a bullet aimed at the contradictions of American global power, while “I Heart Huckabees” spins manically like a hamster’s wheel, blurring its provocative ideas into tiresome intellectual attitudes. 
Mr. Russell came late to “The Fighter,” hired on after other directors had fallen through, and the project seems at once to have unleashed and reined in his extraordinary energies. He and the cast are confident enough to plunge into the richest contradictions and deepest complications of Micky Ward’s life and milieu. (The Ward-Eklund family cooperated with the filmmakers, and one of their friends, Mickey O’Keefe, plays himself on screen.) 
The American working class, in its Northern and Southern Caucasian manifestations, tends to be portrayed in movies either with glib mockery or with an equally condescending solemnity. Micky and Dicky and their clan — seven sisters and that powerhouse of a mother — are vulgar, vicious, loyal, hilarious and a hundred other things, that is, entirely and sometimes embarrassingly human. To say that this family is dysfunctional would be both to understate its troubles and to narrow the film’s scope, which encompasses ethics, sociology and economics as well as psychology. 
Alice, flanked by those seven Fury-like daughters — and occasionally, weakly challenged by her husband (Jack McGee) — stands out in an increasingly crowded field of monstrous movie matriarchs. (See also Mo’Nique in “Precious,” Barbara Hershey in “Black Swan” and Mother Gothel, voiced by Donna Murphy, in “Tangled.”) She and Dicky, her obvious favorite, are supposedly supporting and promoting Micky, but they always seem to undermine his chances for success, which may be their deeper intention. He can never be allowed to surpass his brother, or to think that he’s better than the rest of the family. 
And “The Fighter,” while it persuasively details Micky’s travails in the ring, is more centrally about the fight between Alice and Charlene, his girlfriend, over control of his destiny. Ms. Leo, smoking and raging, as if preparing either to burn Lowell down or kick it to pieces, is a formidable presence, but she is matched by Ms. Adams, whose soft, sweet features disguise a will of steel. The best and hardest punch in a movie full of flying fists is thrown by her. 
Mr. Wahlberg, for his part, leans back against the ropes and watches, underplaying so gracefully and with so little vanity that you almost forget that the movie is supposed to be about Micky. Everyone else seems to do a lot more fighting than the ostensible title character. But the brilliance of Mr. Wahlberg’s quiet performance is that it so effectively mirrors the deep logic of the story, which is finally about the paradox of a man in a violent profession who is fundamentally passive and who must learn how to find some distance from the people who love and need him the most without abandoning them or betraying himself. 
“The Fighter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violent boxing sequences, drug use, obscenity and a bit of sex, though not enough to sap its strength.

‽The Tourist‽,‽It takes a big man to hold the screen level when Angelina Jolie is around — usually the whole thing just tilts in her direction as soon as she struts into the frame. Her partner in crazy-time fame, Brad Pitt, helped keep the balance in “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” their only film together. And now Johnny Depp tries to do much the same in “The Tourist.” Going for muted, eyeliner- and nearly irony-free, he plays an ordinary American who bumbles into a Continental intrigue, which looks like a film you’ve seen before, because you have. 
You know that movie. It’s the one in which Cary Grant and Grace Kelly don’t just travel by train, they also trade knowing looks in the first-class dining car as the waiter fills their glasses, and a shady type secretly takes their photo. The people behind “The Tourist” would like you to flash back to 1955 — as Ms. Jolie’s wardrobe of long gloves suggests  — a risky strategy, given that you actually might. The truth is that it takes an exceptional director to prevent an entertainment as flimsy as this from collapsing under its own weightlessness. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off with Grant and Kelly in “To Catch a Thief,” a bauble that sparkles like a jewel because of the world-class scenery, its stars included, and because of, well, the directing. 
Stargazing is the only reason bonbons like “The Tourist” are made, dreams of box office bonanzas aside. But stars need just the right setting and a director who knows how to make them shine, as Steven Soderbergh does with Mr. Pitt and George Clooney in the “Ocean’s” franchise. The director also needs to hold his own, which, from the generic look and feel of “The Tourist,” clearly wasn’t the case with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. He does put personality into the occasional scene, including a mysterious, hushed interlude in which Ms. Jolie stands with her back to the camera as Mr. Depp creeps up from behind — lover or stalker, you’re not initially sure which — before pulling her close for a hungry kiss. 
It’s a nice idyll among a wash of clichés that include Russian muscle in service to a big meanie, Shaw (Steven Berkoff), whose quest for stolen loot leads him to Elise Ward (Ms. Jolie). A mystery woman of rare ability (she can pick a lock and wear off-the-shoulder gowns), she eludes Shaw while dodging assorted law enforcement agencies, including Scotland Yard, where Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton curl stiff upper lips. Elise pauses long enough to slide into a train seat opposite Frank Tupelo (Mr. Depp), who, after gulping at his good fortune, explains that he’s a vacationing Wisconsin math teacher (as if!). Dinner leads to drinks leads to complications, including hailstorming bullets and a few sluggish boat chases in the Venice canals. 
Hollywood has a long history of collecting (and devouring) European directors, but Mr. von Donnersmarck was an odd choice for froth like this. A few years ago he attracted some attention for “The Lives of Others,” a 2006 drama about an East German couple being spied on by a Stasi officer. Here, his main job seems to have been to find new and flattering ways to shoot Ms. Jolie as she catwalks from Paris to Venice in soaring heels. He tries to invest this adoration with some self-conscious wit, mostly by having all the men in the movie gawp at Elise as if she were as much a supernova as the one playing her. But all this genuflection — she parts one crowd as  Moses does the Red Sea — feels forced rather than mischievous. 
It must be tough for Ms. Jolie to find roles that fit. Off screen she remains a fascinating presence, but on screen she now tends to overwhelm her roles and even her movies. Like every memorable screen star, she still has a face you can get lost in, with its push-pull of hard, jutting angles and well-endowed lips. It’s a face built for extremes, though early on she could also make it work for somewhat smaller, human-scaled roles that were nonetheless tricky for her. Superheroes and superfreaks have long been her truer calling, one reason that “The Tourist” seemed vaguely promising. When she first appears in a come-hither outfit and a small private smile, she looks ready for liftoff. She never ignites, and neither does the movie. 
Mr. Depp doesn’t fare better with a role that forces him to play meek and disappointingly  mild, despite a few screenwriter-supplied tics. (Mr. von Donnersmarck shares writing credit with Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes.) A brilliant character actor and accidental movie star, Mr. Depp has rarely been persuasive playing average. He likes tunneling into his characters, preferably under a thick smear of makeup and flamboyant threads, which is why he’s never made sense in mainstream romance. There’s no place for him to hide with Frank, so he stands around trying to look hapless as Ms. Jolie grabs the lead. There’s definitely some amusement in watching her come to his rescue, a role reversal the movie only flirts with. But oh how much more fun it would have been if Mr. Depp had really played the girl, eyeliner  and all. 
“The Tourist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bloodless violence.

‽
‽The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader‽,‽Not long before the children’s movie “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” sets sail, you might find yourself hoping for a nor’easter to come and blow this latest and perhaps last installment in the screen version of C.S. Lewis’s series, far, far away. But where would it go? Both Never Land and Wonderland are occupied, courtesy of the Walt Disney Company, which helped produce the first “Narnia” movies, the fairly diverting “Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” and the disappointing “Prince Caspian.” Now 20th Century Fox has taken up the franchise with largely dreary results. 
The series has a new director, the generally reliable Michael Apted, who established his rapport with wee ones years ago with “7 Up!,” the first in a documentary series that has revisited the same group of British men and women in new movies every seven years since 1964, when the participants were squirmy 7-year-olds. Though Mr. Apted brings a few minor idiosyncrasies to “Dawn Treader” — notably with his riskily off-putting direction of the young actor Will Poulter, a “Narnia” newcomer — a strong filmmaking voice was clearly not called for in an entertainment that has been carefully calibrated for maximum blandness. Mr. Apted is aboard to keep the franchise sailing along or at least afloat, which he does. 
Mr. Poulter is by far the most unexpected ingredient in the new adventure, primarily because his aggressive, chatterbox performance digs under your skin, which, as it turns out, is what makes it finally work. First seen in the independent film “Son of Rambow,” Mr. Poulter here plays Eustace Scrubb, a cousin of Lucy and Edmund Pevensie (Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes), who, with their brother Peter and sister Susan discovered Narnia. Three books and several years later, Britain is still at war, and Lucy and Edmund are squirreled away with Eustace’s family, to his loquacious displeasure. As he greedily hoards his sweets and mutters invectives, you can see the next Mike Leigh misanthrope being born before your eyes. 
He keeps up the grumbling even after a maritime painting on a wall turns into a Niagara Falls, flooding a bedroom with imaginative computer-generated water and sweeping him, Lucy and Edmund out to sea. They’re soon rescued by their old comrade in arms, King Caspian (Ben Barnes), who is manning the Dawn Treader with a squeaky clean crew of men and talking beasts, including an armed (and tailed) mouse-kateer, Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg). Backslapping and strained comic bits ensue, including a sword fight between a disbelieving Eustace and Reepicheep, a kind of furry Jiminy Cricket but without the mellifluous pipes. The ship makes a few pit stops on enchanted islands, amid boatloads of exposition, which reinforce the sense that it’s a long way before the series will drop anchor. 
It remains to be seen whether we’ll get there — there are four more books — though it would help if a better balance were struck between the actors, most of whom could use a firmer hand, and the special effects. (This one comes in 3-D, a wasted effort.) Though there are times when the movie turns into a congested mess, as in a climactic battle that washes the screen in gray, there are moments when you also see a quieter, less industrial production. Such is the case after Eustace is turned into a grand, ungainly, unhappy dragon. When he lies forlornly on a beach, or as forlornly as dragons do, and a monstrous-size tear slides down his scaly face, you don’t just see the wizardry magic, you also see the human touch behind it. 
“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” is rated PG. Parental guidance suggested but not essential. 
THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA 
The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 
Opens on Friday  nationwide.  
Directed by Michael Apted; written by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Michael Petroni, based on the book by C. S. Lewis; director of photography, Dante Spinotti; edited by Rick Shaine; music by David Arnold; production design by Barry Robison; costumes by Isis Mussenden; produced by Mark Johnson, Andrew Adamson and Philip Steuer; released by Fox 2000  Pictures and Walden Media. Running time: 1 hour 55 minutes. 
WITH: Georgie Henley (Lucy Pevensie), Skandar Keynes (Edmund Pevensie), Ben Barnes (Caspian), Will Poulter (Eustace Scrubb), Liam Neeson (Voice of Aslan), Simon Pegg (Voice of Reepicheep) and Tilda Swinton (The White Witch). 
‽
‽The Warrior's Way‽,‽There are a lot of different movies jostling for our attention inside “The Warrior’s Way.” In terms of formula, it resembles the chop suey western “Shanghai Noon”: an Asian princess and her protector are transported to the Wild West, where they’re pursued by Americans with guns and Asians with swords. Jackie Chan has been replaced by the  Korean star Jang Dong Gun, and Lucy Liu by a remarkably composed toddler named Analin Rudd. 
On a conceptual level “The Warrior’s Way” is something altogether different and more self-conscious. Set in a fantastical ghost town with a resident circus troupe and filmed on studio sets, it looks like a Sergio Leone epic as staged by Fellini, or by Lars von Trier. The genre-mashing makes sense, given the résumé of the writer and director, Sngmoo Lee, who has a master’s degree in cinema studies from New York University and helped found the film department at the Korean National University of Arts. 
The best way to understand the film, though, is in commercial terms: as an attempt to use Mr. Jang to cash in on the audience that has come out for crossover action hits starring Mr. Chan and Jet Li. Mr. Jang has presence and a movie-star face, but he’s a latecomer to martial arts and swordplay; following a typical South   Korean path, he started out in soap operas and moved into crime and war movies, building a distinguished (and highly profitable) filmography that includes the great action-crime drama “Nowhere to Hide.” 
Generalizing brutally, you could argue that Hong Kong movies require actors trained to be fluid and funny, while South   Korean movies like their male characters stiff and stern, and Mr. Jang doesn’t make the same kind of impression in “The Warrior’s Way” that his Hong Kong counterparts have in their American movies. The film also muffles him by keeping his dialogue to a minimum (even though his English is perfectly acceptable), filling the space with Geoffrey Rush’s narration and the chattering of Kate Bosworth’s logorrheic female sidekick. 
Mr. Jang is not the problem with “The Warrior’s Way,” however. That would be Mr. Lee’s screenplay, a thin and unconvincing gruel of western clichés, martial arts action and forced comedy that wouldn’t make the grade in the graphic novels that have clearly helped form his vision. 
Ms. Bosworth, the phlegmatic Mr. Jang and a ragged, occasionally amusing Mr. Rush  — the good, the sad and the ugly  — face off against a cartoonish brigand (Danny Huston, admirably restrained) and phalanxes of hooded swordsmen led by the usual mystical Chinese warrior (Ti Lung, ditto). The sometimes impressive visual effects make these battles entertaining, in a mindless way, but it’s impossible to work up any feeling about them. The only thing supplying that is the occasional laugh, pout or gurgle by Ms. Rudd. 
“The Warrior’s Way” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for increasingly intense comic-book violence.

‽
‽Black Swan‽,‽A witchy brew of madness and cunning, “Black Swan” tells the story of a ballerina who aches, with battered feet and an increasingly crowded head, to break out of the corps. Played by Natalie Portman in a smashing, bruising, wholly committed performance, the young dancer, Nina, looks more like a child than a woman, her flesh as undernourished as her mind. When she goes to bed at night, a nearby jewelry box tinkling “Swan Lake,” a crowd of stuffed animals watches over her, longtime companions that — as Nina and this dementedly entertaining film grow more unhinged — begin to look more like jailers than friends. 
Crammed with twins — lookalikes, mirrored images, doppelgängers — the story follows that of the “Swan Lake” ballet in broad, gradually warped strokes. It opens with the artistic director of a fictional New York ballet company, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), announcing that the new season will begin with a “visceral and real” version of that old favorite. To that end he dumps his prima ballerina, Beth  (Winona Ryder), and picks Nina to dance the dual role of the swan queen (an enchanted woman in bird form) and her villainous black twin. But as the pressure builds, things fall apart, or Nina does. She stumbles out of a spin and begins scratching at her skin. One day she strips a piece from her finger as lightly as if she were peeling a banana. 
Part tortured-artist drama, “Black Swan” looks like a tony art-house entertainment. (Hey, there’s Lincoln Center!) But what gives it a jolt is its giddy, sometimes sleazy exploitation-cinema savvy. The director Darren Aronofsky is a well-schooled cinéaste, and in “Black Swan” he riffs on Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s ballet masterpiece, “The Red Shoes,” and the pair’s “Black Narcissus,” among other influences. But it’s also likely that Mr. Aronofsky, who was born in 1969 and grew up in Brooklyn, frequented Times Square when it was known as the deuce and lined with movie palaces playing the best and worst in trash cinema. I bet he also caught a few episodes of the “Red Shoe Diaries” on cable. 
That isn’t a knock. One of the pleasures of “Black Swan” is its lack of reverence toward the rarefied world of ballet, which to  outsiders can look as lively as a crypt. Mr. Aronofsky makes this world (or his version of it) exciting partly by pulling back the velvet curtains and showing you the sacrifices and crushingly hard work that goes into creating beautiful dances. Nina doesn’t just pirouette prettily, she also cracks her damaged toes (the sound design picking up every crackle and crunch) and sticks her fingers down her throat to vomit up her food. Mostly, though, she trains hard, hammering her toe shoes into floor much as Jake La Motta  pounded his fists into flesh. She’s a contender, but also a martyr to her art. 
Mr. Aronofsky is happy to see her bleed. A filmmaker who likes to play around with genre while mixing the highbrow with the lowdown and dirty, he has built a small, vivid catalog by exploring human extremes with wildly uneven degrees of visual wow, sensitivity and intelligence. He trawled the lower depths in “Requiem for a Dream” and struggled to scale the metaphysical heights with “The Fountain,” a fable about eternal (as in, when will it end?) love. For his previous  movie, “The Wrestler,” he proved his commercial smarts by taking Mickey Rourke out of deep freeze and dusting off a comeback story that was old when Wallace Beery wiped Jackie Cooper’s runny nose with the script for “The Champ.” 
“Black Swan,” by contrast, surprises despite its lusty or rather sluttish predilection for clichés, which include the requisitely demanding impresario (Mr. Cassel makes a model cock of the walk) and Nina’s ballerina rival, Lily (Mila Kunis, as a succulent, borderline rancid peach). But, oh, what Mr. Aronofsky does with those clichés, which he embraces, exploits and, by a squeak, finally transcends. 
Such is his faith in his ability to surmount the obvious (and the lethally blunt) that he turns Nina’s mother, Erica (a terrific Barbara Hershey), into a smother-mother who out-crazies Faye Dunaway’s Joan Crawford in the mommy dearest department. You don’t know whether to laugh or shriek (both are reasonable responses),     and it is this  uncertainty and at times delicious unease that proves to be Mr. Aronofsky’s sweet spot. 
It’s easy to read “Black Swan” as a  gloss on the artistic pursuit of the ideal. But take another  look, and you see that Mr. Aronofsky is simultaneously telling that story straight, playing with the suffering-artist stereotype and having his nasty way with Nina, burdening her with trippy psychodrama and letting her run wild in a sexcapade  that will soon be in heavy rotation on the Web. The screenplay, by  Mark Heyman, Andrés Heinz and John McLaughlin, invites pop-psychological interpretations about women who self-mutilate while striving for their perfect selves, a description that seems to fit Nina. But such a reading only flattens a film that from scene to scene is deadly serious, downright goofy and by turns shocking, funny and touching. 
With “Black Swan” Mr. Aronofsky has found a surprisingly accommodating vehicle for his preoccupations, including bodies in pain, and his ever more refined technique. Here, working with his usual cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, and largely shooting hand-held in both super-16-millimeter film and digital, Mr. Aronofsky opts for grit over gloss, an ideal strategy for a story with a harsh underbelly. Hand-held cinematography can be lazy shorthand for “reality” (as if life happens in shaky-cam), but here the hand-held visuals work because of their intimacy. The influence of the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne can be seen in the close, tag-along shots of Nina’s head as she hurries off, a point of view that brings you within breathing, at times panting, distance of a character whose behavior can be off-putting. 
Though it had its moments, “The Wrestler” felt like the work of a director who, after proving his street   bona fides and bombing at the box office, decided to try some pandering. It worked: Mr. Rourke was rediscovered, and Mr. Aronofsky’s future was salvaged, in part because he had closed the distance between the fallen star played by Mr. Rourke and the one he himself had become. Ms. Portman’s performance in “Black Swan” is more art than autobiography, and as a consequence more honest, but because it’s so demandingly physical the lines that usually divide actresses from their characters are also blurred. This is, after all, Ms. Portman’s own thin body on display, her jutting chest bones as sharply defined as a picket fence. 
Although Mr. Aronofsky focuses on her head, shoulders and arms, mostly avoiding long shots that might betray a lack of technique, Ms. Portman does most of her own dancing (and plausibly, at least to this ballet naïf). The vision of Ms. Portman’s own body straining with so much tremulous, tremendous  effort, her pale arms fluttering in desperation, grounds the story in the real, as do the totemic Lincoln Center buildings, the clattering subway and the grubby, claustrophobic apartment Nina shares with her mother. Together they create the solid foundation of truth that makes the slow-creeping hallucinatory flights of fantasy all the more jolting and powerful. Much like the new version of “Swan Lake” that Thomas creates, “Black Swan” is visceral and real even while it’s one delirious, phantasmagoric freakout. 
“Black Swan” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bedroom gymnastics  and graphic violence.  
BLACK SWAN 
Opens on Friday  in New York, Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Plano, Tex., San Franciso, Washington and Los Angeles.  
Directed by Darren Aronofsky; written by Mark Heyman, Andrés Heinz and John McLaughlin, based on a story by Mr. Heinz; director of photography, Matthew Libatique; edited by Andrew Weisblum; music by Clint Mansell; ballet choreography by Benjamin Millepied; production design by Thérèse DePrez; costumes by Amy Westcott, ballet costumes by Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte; produced by Mike Medavoy, Arnold W. Messer, Brian Oliver and Scott Franklin; released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.

‽
‽Hollywood to Dollywood‽,‽The optimism and good humor of John Lavin’s crude, endearing documentary “Hollywood to Dollywood” are so unquenchable that its disturbing underlying theme — growing up gay in the South is no picnic — is partly obscured by its openheartedness. The subjects, Gary and Larry Lane, are gay identical twins in their mid-30s from a Southern Baptist background who grew up in a small North Carolina town and moved to Los Angeles a decade ago. 
The film follows them on a road trip in an RV named Jolene from Southern California to Dollywood, the Pigeon Forge, Tenn., theme park whose namesake is the twins’ idol, Dolly Parton. As part of a celebration of the park’s 25th anniversary, Ms. Parton is scheduled to perform there and appear in a parade. During the festivities they hope to hand her a screenplay they have been working on for five years, with a role written for her. 
Talk about diva worship! To the Lane brothers, Ms. Parton looms as more than a glamorous star from humble Southern roots. She is a virtual saint, whose common-sense wisdom and compassion are inspirations. 
The brothers’ stories of rejection by their mother would be heartbreaking and infuriating if related by less resilient people. But perhaps because they have each other, as well as long-term boyfriends — Gary’s partner, Mike Bowen, travels with them — they are more saddened than devastated. 
The brothers came out to each other when they were 16. They were 25 when they told their mother; Larry remembers her asking him to put his hand on a Bible and swear he wasn’t gay. He refused, and she later fell apart. Even now, the brothers say, residents of their hometown don’t know about their sexuality. 
As they make their way through northern Texas in tornado weather to Nashville, which is still recovering from a catastrophic flood, they tell their stories, visit friends and chat about Ms. Parton with everyone they meet. You realize the degree to which Ms. Parton, a Tennessee mountain native, now 66, is a folk heroine to people throughout the South. Larding the film are excerpts from 15 Dolly Parton songs and clips of her television appearances, including fragments of a 2010 interview with Larry King. 
You have to admire a beloved entertainer who declares, with apparent sincerity, “I have more guts than talent.” 
‽
‽Sacrifice‽,‽Vengeance takes time — and no end of lurid plotting — in “Sacrifice,” Chen Kaige’s soapy, sentimental epic about political ambition and paternal love. 
Based on the Yuan dynasty play “Orphan of Zhao,” the story centers on Chen Ying (Ge You), a humble court doctor who, at great personal cost, saves the life of the newborn heir to the throne when the child’s family is massacred in a coup led by the deadeyed Gen. Tu Angu (Wang Xue-qi). Over the next 15 years Chen will raise the boy as his own, naming him Bo and wangling both of them into the palace of the usurper, who unwittingly agrees to become Bo’s godfather. Torn between two dads — one rich and magnanimous, the other servile and smotheringly strict — poor Bo is as ignorant of his heritage as of Chen’s plan to use him as his avenger. 
Given that the important female characters are swiftly dispatched early on, this is a film heavy with the desires of men who appear to have no interest in, or access to, sex. (A concubine or two would have brightened things up considerably.) And though the initial coup is staged with wit as well as blood — did you know you could overthrow a ruler with a mosquito, a mad dog and a strategically placed tripwire? — Mr. Chen’s direction feels more ponderous than usual. Perhaps it’s all that armor, or that even the estimable Mr. Wang seems exhausted by the film’s dolorous themes, but it’s tough to care about characters who spend most of their lives obsessing over the violent deaths of others. 
“Sacrifice” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A cheek is slashed, a bunny killed and a horse’s eye swallowed whole. 
‽
‽The City Dark‽,‽A documentary about light pollution that is entertaining and thought-provoking? It hardly seems possible, but that’s what Ian Cheney has made in “The City Dark.” 
Mr. Cheney’s film is a personal lament for the star-filled night sky he experienced growing up in Maine, but it is neither sorrowful nor a rant; he somehow manages to give this engaging work a sense of humor. He also manages to make it smart, avoiding traps that might have snared other documentarians, like merely regurgitating the details of some local dispute over electronic signs or stadium lighting. 
Instead he and the people he interviews explore what our increasing inability to see the night sky means for us philosophically. 
“Seeing the universe around us tells us about our own part of the universe,” says Jeffrey R. Kuhn, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii, “and to close that door, I think, would change the character of humankind entirely.” 
Mr. Cheney reminds us of just how recent the phenomenon of an illuminated night is. Until a comparatively few generations ago, a campfire was the only noncelestial thing intruding on the daily darkness. Now, of course, our most inhabited places essentially have no night, and whatever human rhythms were tied to the natural cycle of light and dark may have been disrupted. 
Mr. Cheney is interested in more than the airy spiritual consequences of this. He also explores what it might be doing to health, noting studies involving night-shift workers and cancer. 
Other species are affected as well. Perhaps the film’s most poignant footage is of newly hatched sea turtles in Florida that are confused about where the ocean is because of lights around the nesting grounds. 
“When we add light to the environment,” says Chad Moore, the leader of a National Park Service team studying the issue, “that has the potential to disrupt habitat, just like running a bulldozer over the landscape can. Darkness is a necessary habitat for nocturnal animals.” 
Mr. Cheney looks at a few attempts to use alternative lighting, including in the High Line park in Manhattan, but all in all, darkness seems to be fighting a losing battle. This film makes you want to go find a starry sky to camp under quickly, before it’s all gone. 
‽
‽Angels Crest‽,‽The small, hardy community in the Rocky Mountains that gives “Angels Crest” its name is a rough-hewn working-class town of grain elevators and meat-and-potatoes eateries where everyone knows everyone else’s business. Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekker), the film’s main character, is a 21-year-old father who works in an auto parts shop and is raising his 3-year-old son, Nate, singlehandedly. The child’s mother, Cindy (Lynn Collins), a bitter and promiscuous alcoholic much older than Ethan, keeps her distance. 
Tragedy strikes early, when Ethan packs Nate into his pickup truck and drives into the woods to hunt. After parking on the side of the road, he buckles his son into his child seat, turns up the heat and leaves Nate alone while he stalks deer. When Ethan returns, Nate has disappeared, and he panics. A frantic search ensues, with teams of men combing the woods. Even after the search is abandoned, Ethan continues looking for the boy, whom he eventually discovers frozen to death. 
“Angels Crest,” directed by Gaby Dellal, is a sustained howl of grief in which Ethan’s unassailable sorrow and guilt send an arrow into your heart. In these scenes the screenplay, adapted by Catherine Trieschmann from a novel by Leslie Schwartz, captures the same excruciating pain beyond words that Atom Egoyan distilled in his adaptation of “The Sweet Hereafter” by Russell Banks. That film, about a small town’s trauma after many of its children die in a school bus accident, had more concentrated grief than any film I can recall. 
But the other parts of “Angels Crest” mostly don’t fit. Although the movie captures the solidarity and the beauty and peril of a rustic mountain town whose residents are necessarily interdependent, its individual subplots don’t connect. Despite several solid performances, the characters are too hazily sketched and too loosely linked to form a meaningful chain. 
Ms. Collins as the absentee mother, who in a rage tries to run down Ethan in her car, is a self-pitying, one-dimensional nightmare. A story line involving Cindy’s relationship with her devout mother (Barbara Williams) tries and fails to humanize her. When Cindy snaps at her mother, “You have your god; I have mine,” a reference to booze, all you feel is disgust. 
Another subplot involving Ethan’s best friend, Rusty (Joseph Morgan), who was sleeping with Cindy when the tragedy occurred, is left undeveloped. A strand that follows Ethan’s friend Jane (Elizabeth McGovern), a lesbian waitress at the diner that is a kind of clearinghouse for the film’s characters, drifts aimlessly. Nate’s death makes Jane uncomfortably aware of her own troubled history as a parent. (Her grown son shows up with his pregnant girlfriend.) The incident also fortifies the bond between the diner’s proprietor, Angie (Mira Sorvino), another undeveloped character, and her young daughter. 
Most out of place is Jeremy Piven as Jack, a local district attorney, with his own tragic baggage that (frustratingly) is alluded to but never specified. Jack, who seeks to prosecute Ethan for criminally negligent homicide, methodically interviews the townspeople, whom he finds to be divided over Ethan’s culpability. 
All of this adds up to much ado about much less than meets the eye. Situations that could illuminate merely distract. And the abrupt, melodramatic conclusion feels unearned. Despite its earnest and frostbitten atmosphere, “Angels Crest” is a film of sadly missed opportunities. 
“Angels Crest” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and strong language.

‽
‽The Darkest Hour‽,‽Based on the admittedly flimsy evidence of films like “The Darkest Hour,” the best defense against invading aliens is to be as attractive as possible. Being one-dimensional doesn’t hurt, either, even if that particular character flaw can be safely blamed on whoever is responsible for the screenplay — in this case, Jon Spaihts. Given that he is also one of two writers credited on Ridley Scott’s much anticipated 2012 film (and possible “Alien” prequel) “Prometheus,” it is to be hoped that his lazy ideas were not equally apportioned between the two projects. 
Because, really, how slovenly is it to use invisible aliens? If you’re going to tease us with nothing but pinwheels of light for three-quarters of the film, you’d better have one heck of a reveal up your sleeve. But if all you have is the equivalent of exploding garden gnomes, then your problems are greater than a disposable cast and a filming style as flat as the color palette. As one cement-gray scene follows another, audiences may find themselves rooting for the aliens, if only because their sparkly cloaking devices at least offer visual stimulation. 
Working from a story that has been knocking around for years, Mr. Spaihts and his director, Chris Gorak, send two Internet entrepreneurs (Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella) to Moscow to finish a business deal. When they learn that a Swedish opportunist (Joel Kinnaman) has stolen their idea, our lads head to a nightclub to lick their wounds and distract themselves with perky female tourists (namely Olivia Thirlby and Rachael Taylor). There the four — and the scheming Swede — will remain for the next few days as fireballs from outer space transform most of humanity into untidy piles of cremains. 
While we wait for the core cast to be reduced to the requisite breeding pair, we have time to ponder the pointlessness of the Moscow setting, chosen primarily to allow the filmmakers access to stock Russian characters — like the crazy inventor and the band of armed-to-the-teeth partisans — and exotic architecture. 
“The audience will enjoy it and will feel it’s something new,” Timur Bekmambetov, one of the film’s producers, assures us in the publicity notes, but I wouldn’t be so confident. The audience is more likely to be wondering why Mr. Bekmambetov, the sometimes inspired mind behind the supernatural pictures “Night Watch” and its sequel, “Day Watch,” proved unable to inject life into this one. 
Also a mystery is the apparent evaporation of Mr. Gorak’s freshman promise. When, in 2006, he wrote and directed the electrifying no-budget thriller “Right at Your Door,” you wondered what he might accomplish with more cash and greater resources. Now we know: despite a title grandiosely borrowed from Winston Churchill, “The Darkest Hour” is yet another depressing failure of imagination. Even with a technological gold mine at his disposal, all Mr. Gorak can conceive of is destruction. 
“The Darkest Hour” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Humans are atomized, and panties are flashed.

‽
‽War Horse‽,‽There is no combat in the early scenes of “War Horse,” Steven Spielberg’s sweeping adaptation of the popular stage spectacle, but the film opens with a cinematic assault as audacious and unsparing as the Normandy landing in “Saving Private Ryan.” With widescreen, pastoral vistas dappled in golden sunlight and washed in music (by John Williams) that is somehow both grand and folksy, Mr. Spielberg lays siege to your cynicism, bombarding you with strong and simple appeals to feeling. 
You may find yourself resisting this sentimental pageant of early-20th-century rural English life, replete with verdant fields, muddy tweeds and damp turnips, but my strong advice is to surrender. Allow your sped-up, modern, movie-going metabolism, accelerated by a diet of frantic digital confections — including Mr. Spielberg’s just-released “Adventures of Tintin” — to calm down a bit. Suppress your instinctive impatience, quiet the snarky voice in your head and allow yourself to recall, or perhaps to discover, the deep pleasures of sincerity. 
If you can fake that, the old Hollywood adage goes, you’ve got it made. But while “War Horse” is, like so many of Mr. Spielberg’s films, a work of supreme artifice, it is also a self-conscious attempt to revive and pay tribute to a glorious tradition of honest, emotionally direct storytelling. Shot the old-fashioned way, on actual film stock (the cinematographer is Mr. Spielberg’s frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski), the picture has a dark, velvety luster capable of imparting a measure of movie-palace magic to the impersonal cavern of your local multiplex. An Interview With the “War Horse” Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski 
The story, in its early chapters, also takes you back to an older — you may well say cornier — style of entertainment. Joey, the fleet-footed, headstrong half-Thoroughbred of the title, is purchased at auction by Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), a proud and grouchy Devon farmer with a tendency to drink too much. His household includes a loving, scolding wife, Rosie (Emily Watson); a cantankerous goose; and a strapping lad named Albert (Jeremy Irvine), who forms an immediate and unbreakable bond with Joey. The teenage boy trains the horse to pull a plow and together they ride through the stunning scenery. 
But this pastoral is darkened by memories of war — Ted fought the Boers in South Africa, an experience so terrible he cannot speak of it to his son — and by social divisions. The Narracotts are tenant farmers at the mercy of their landlord (David Thewlis), and if “War Horse” pays tribute to solid British virtues of decency and discipline it also, like a Thomas Hardy novel, exposes the snobbery and economic oppression that are, if anything, even more deeply rooted in that nation’s history. 
So it is not entirely a simpler, more innocent world that is swept away by the war but rather a way of life whose contradictions are as emphatically presented as its charms. And what follows, as Joey is taken across the English Channel to the battlefields and trenches of Flanders and France, is a nightmare of cruelty that is not without its own sinister magic. Like most movies with an antiwar message, “War Horse” cannot help but be enthralled by the epic scale and transformative power of military conflict. “The war has taken everything from everyone” — the truth of this reckoning, uttered more than once by characters on screen, is self-evident, but it is complicated by the visceral charge and cathartic relief that an effective war movie gives to its audience. 
The extreme violence of the slaughter in World War I is implied rather than graphically depicted. Mr. Spielberg steps back from the bloody, chaotic naturalism of “Saving Private Ryan” — this is an animal fable for children, after all, with echoes of “E. T.” and Carroll Ballard’s “Black Stallion” — but his ability to infuse action sequences with emotional gravity has hardly diminished. 
An early battle scene dramatizes the modernization of warfare with remarkable and haunting efficiency. A British cavalry unit attacks a German encampment, charging through the enemy ranks with swords in what appears to be a clean and devastating rout. But then, at the edge of the field, the German machine guns begin to fire, and the British horses crash into the forest, suddenly riderless and instantly obsolete. Joey, who of course never sought out heroism in the first place, is relegated to a life of brutal labor that seems fated to end in an ignoble death. 
He is kept alive by instinct, human kindness and the companionship of a regal black horse named Topthorn. Joey’s episodic journey takes him from British to German hands and back again, with a sojourn on a French farm owned by an elderly jam-maker (Niels Arestrup) and his young granddaughter (Celine Buckens). 
Albert, meanwhile, makes his own way to the war, and his and Joey’s parallel experiences — harrowing escapes, the loss of friends, the terror and deprivation brightened by flickers of tenderness or high spirits — give the story texture and momentum, as well as giving Mr. Spielberg an opportunity to show off, once again, his unmatched skill at cross-cutting. (The large cast, mostly British and almost entirely male, acquits itself admirably, with a few moments of maudlin overacting and many more of heartbreaking understatement.) 
Mr. Spielberg and the screenwriters, Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, have wisely avoided attempting to reproduce the atmosphere and effects of the stage production, in which Joey and the other horses are portrayed by huge puppets. He prefers to translate the tale, which originates in a novel by Michael Morpurgo, into a fully cinematic idiom. And “War Horse” turns out to have a central Spielbergian theme — perhaps the dominant idea in this director’s body of work — namely the fraught and fascinating relationship between the human and the nonhuman. An Interview With Steven Spielberg 
What do they — sharks, horses, aliens, dinosaurs, intelligent machines — mean to us? What are we supposed to do with them? The boundary can be hard to maintain: sometimes, as in “E. T.” and “A. I.,” nonhuman beings are virtually impossible to distinguish from humans; at other times, as in “Amistad” and “Schindler’s List,” self-evidently human beings are denied that status. Sometimes the nonhuman is a threat, at other times a comfort, but it always presents a profound ethical challenge based in a stark existential mystery: Who are we? 
Mr. Spielberg’s answers to this question tend to be hopeful, and his taste for happy, or at least redemptive endings is frequently criticized. But his ruthless optimism, while it has helped to make him an enormously successful showman, is also crucial to his identity as an artist, and is more complicated than many of his detractors realize. “War Horse” registers the loss and horror of a gruesomely irrational episode in history, a convulsion that can still seem like an invitation to despair. To refuse that, to choose compassion and consolation, requires a measure of obstinacy, a muscular and brutish willfulness that is also an authentic kind of grace. 
“War Horse” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The violence is intense and upsetting, though not especially gory by present-day standards.

‽
‽We Bought a Zoo‽,‽Cameron Crowe may be the last of the Hollywood romantics. He’s best known for his stories about love and longing, for films that immortalize the moment when characters bare their hearts, as when John Cusack serenades a girl with a boom box in “Say Anything” and Renée Zellweger tells Tom Cruise he had her at hello in “Jerry Maguire.” These are images of such excruciating sincerity that they invite, almost demand cynicism. Yet it’s their openness that makes them work. And while his films depend on the familiar image of the couple in love, these are relationships that exist within a larger tribe, a band, a family and now, with “We Bought a Zoo,” a menagerie. 
What Mr. Crowe’s films also share is his delicate touch with actors. Ms. Zellweger has never been better than in “Jerry Maguire,” which found both Mr. Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. at their most appealing. Matt Damon, the star of “We Bought a Zoo,” is a stronger actor than those with whom Mr. Crowe often works, and the combination might initially seem off. Mr. Crowe leans toward lightness while Mr. Damon, who can do glib as well as the next star, likes to roam around in the shadows, so that even his comedies carry a sting (as with “The Informant!”). But this seriousness, which complicates his boyishness with pathos, gives ballast to a movie that might have drifted along on charm. 
When “We Bought a Zoo” opens, his character, Benjamin Mee, is struggling to hold on to his family and his Los Angeles journalism career after the recent death of his wife, Katherine (Stephanie Szostak). Benjamin has yet to get a grip on being a single parent to 14-year-old Dylan (Colin Ford) and 7-year-old Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones, a natural), but he seems strangely at ease, whether he’s fumbling with school lunches or warding off predatory moms bearing trays of condolence lasagna. He’s so self-assured that when his editor doesn’t respond to his story pitches, Benjamin just up and quits with a smile. 
The confidence with which Benjamin breezes out the door (in a job-shedding profession like journalism, no less) immediately signals that you’re not in Kansas anymore, or anywhere resembling the real world. He rationalizes that it’s for the good of his children, who are the same two reasons most people would cling to their jobs. 
In classic movie logic, he doesn’t agonize about how he’ll keep his children housed, fed and clothed; he doesn’t even scramble for new work. Instead, he sells their home and buys a picturesquely dilapidated house with mountain views that not only comes with a lion, tigers and bears, but also a lovely zookeeper, Kelly Foster (an appealing Scarlett Johansson). The zoo, to judge by the shy glances, is more of an ark. 
There are complications, though this being a Cameron Crowe movie they’re soon worked out. The zoo, having fallen into disrepair, has been closed and is being kept going by the sheer good will of employees like Kelly. Benjamin starts writing checks and, with the help of the staff (the cast includes Patrick Fugit and Angus Macfadyen), the zoo squeaks and roars back into shape. The enclosures are repaired and expanded, the bills and employees paid. Little Rosie takes to her new home swimmingly even as Dylan sulks and stomps about, initially unreceptive to Kelly’s attentive cousin, Lily (Elle Fanning). Benjamin, meanwhile, continues to keep it together, his facade of confidence occasionally dinged by a bit of slapstick, child trouble and some palpably anguished nights. 
“We Bought a Zoo” is based on a nonfiction book of the same title that chronicles how the British journalist Benjamin Mee together with his family bought a closed zoo that they rehabilitated, renamed and reopened in 2007. Mr. Mee’s mother, Amelia, was in on the family’s grand adventure as was Mr. Mee’s wife, Katherine, who died shortly after. In the movie, the brutality of illness and death remains safely off-screen when it comes to people and animals alike. Instead, Mr. Crowe makes the escalating tension between Benjamin and Dylan the story’s soft center — a miscalculation. Dylan’s petulance registers as generically adolescent rather than anguished, and his company wears thin, partly because Benjamin’s doesn’t. 
The creaks, groans and clichés of the screenplay, which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (“27 Dresses”) and reworked by Mr. Crowe are, however, finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers, those with two legs and more, and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role. Mr. Crowe doesn’t linger over Benjamin’s despondency. 
Rather, he gives it gentle due in passages that remind you that there’s often a strain of melancholia in this director’s work, a sadness that suggests that Mr. Crowe intimately knows the darkness and uses his movies as a way to resist (or deny) it. Whatever the case, you may not buy his happy endings, but it’s a seductive ideal when all of God’s creatures, great and small, buxom and blond, exist in such harmony. 
“We Bought a Zoo” is rated PG. (Parental guidance suggested.) A dead mother and a dying animal.

B. Smoove (Mr. Stevens). 
‽
‽The Adventures of Tintin‽,‽Before Indiana Jones cracked his bullwhip for some old-fashioned Hollywood fun, Tintin circled the globe in the name of European divertissement. The pen-and-ink creation of the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (1907-83), known better as Hergé, Tintin is the charming boy reporter and adventurer who, with his white fox terrier Snowy close at heel, has traveled the world since 1929 in action-packed yarns with titles like “Cigars of the Pharaoh.” It was only a matter of time before Tintin went Hollywood. And, yowza, has he hit it big and hard in “The Adventures of Tintin,” a marvel of gee-wizardry and a night’s entertainment that can feel like a lifetime. 
What took him so long? Certainly Tintin comes with many of the prerequisites for big-screen exploits, including pluck, ingenuity, derring-do, exotic locales, and a ready-made team of friends and foes. Many of these are busily at play in “The Adventures of Tintin,” an animated boy’s own adventure directed by Steven Spielberg, that eternal Hollywood boy wonder. Almost wholly cooked up in a computer and using motion-capture technology, it turns on a riddle that takes the story from sea to desert and other landlubbing destinations, including an imaginary Moroccan city, Bagghar (a play on a French word for brawl, bagarre), which looks as canned as a sand-strewn set for a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road movie if tidier and pricier. 
Written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, “The Adventures of Tintin” is stitched together from three Hergé books, including “The Secret of the Unicorn.” It begins promisingly enough when Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) spots a model of a ship, the Unicorn, in a market. Taken with its painstaking detail — a nice metaphor for this precisely wrought, vaguely 1940s world — he buys the model, though his purchase is challenged by a mustachioed American detective, Barnaby (Joe Starr), and a meddler of ominous provenance, Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig), whose name is a reminder that Tintin’s inaugural comic pitted him against the Bolsheviks. (“I think the dirty little bourgeois is asleep,” a Bolshevik agent says in “Tintin in the Land of the Soviets,” before failing to blow him up.) 
Tintin keeps the model, in which he finds the riddle that sets him and Snowy off on a series of zippily choreographed chases that first take them from their home in Brussels to a freighter, where they meet Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), a blustering boozer who’s more amusing on the page than onscreen. Haddock, one of Tintin’s frequent comrades in adventure, holds the secret to the mystery, though he’s initially too loaded to know it. (Tintin may tsk-tsk Haddock’s sousing ways, but the movie takes a blithely amused view of drunkenness.) It’s only later, when Haddock dries up while lost and hallucinating in a desert — in a wonderful sequence in which crested sand dunes melt into peaking ocean waves and back again — does he offer relief beyond the comic. 
It’s easy to see why Mr. Spielberg took on Tintin, which he has described as “Indiana Jones for kids” (a redundant notion). The most involved chase sequence in the movie finds Tintin and company creatively racing through, and laying waste to, Bagghar, much as Indy does to a stretch of Cairo in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” In contrast to “Raiders,” which sees Indy shooting a sword-wielding opponent in a jokey illustration of Western imperialist might, Tintin’s adventures here feel willfully guileless: colonialism may haunt Tintin’s world as imagined by Hergé, but it doesn’t trouble this one. Tintin is racing after the riddle of the Unicorn, but mostly he’s chasing mystery for mystery’s sake, a search that — once he bonds with Haddock — transforms into a more personally redemptive quest. 
In this boy-chases-man world there’s scarcely room for women. Hope and Crosby had Dorothy Lamour, but that kind of honey trap would bring Eros into the equation, thereby endangering the childlike innocence ( really, a convenient naïveté) that defines Tintin, a character who’s as resolutely neutered as his dog presumably is. So instead, the story trots out a sole distaff representative in the ludicrous form of Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel), a dowager diva with a barrel build and a glass-shattering voice. One high note later and the scene has gone kablooey, setting off another round of Rube Goldberg-like calamities that keep Tintin hopping and running and jumping and driving and chasing — as the virtual cameras swoop and dip — like a Tom and Jerry cartoon on repeat. 
Mr. Bell imports boyish wonder into Tintin’s voice, but there’s nothing he can do with the way the character looks. Neither fully human nor fully animated, Mr. Spielberg’s Tintin resembles Hergé’s creation yet is eerily different, as if, like Pinocchio’s, his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted. This Tintin is lifelike, but without the pulse of real life. The problem is that Mr. Spielberg has erred on the side of verisimilitude with a technology — in which an actor’s movements and facial gestures are transmitted via electrodes to a computer — that because it’s a simulacrum of life, still works better for otherworldly creatures like the blue Pandorans in “Avatar” or broad caricatures like Tintin’s bubbling allies, the detective duo Thompson and Thomson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). 
Drawn in a simple, elegant style known as clear line, Hergé’s Tintin has a spherical head, a stub nose and black ovals for eyes. His half-circle brows sit on his face like accent marks and, with his red-smudged cheeks and beads of sweat that invariably pop off his head, give Tintin surprising expressivity. 
The simplicity is as crucial to the comic’s power as is Hergé’s ability to turn a recognizable world into bold lines and blots of color. It’s a face that looks like a mask, one readers can slip on as they rush through the story or leisurely turn the page. And it’s a face that, along with Tintin’s asexuality and lack of a family, makes him into a marvelous blank, an avatar for armchair adventurers. 
Like the screen Tintin, the movie proves less than inviting because it’s been so wildly overworked: there is hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes. Relax, you think, as Tintin and the story rush off again, as if Mr. Spielberg were afraid of losing us with European-style longueurs. Bore us? He’s Steven Spielberg! This lack of modulation grows tedious, which is too bad because, as always with him, there are interludes of cinematic delight, when his visual imagination (like the transition in which Tintin and Haddock seem to appear in a puddle someone steps in) and his Spielbergian playfulness get the better of his insistence on bludgeoning us with technique. 
“The Adventures of Tintin” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Bloodless gun violence and head bashing. 
‽
‽Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows‽,‽Robert Downey Jr. is currently carrying two movie franchises — the Marvel “Iron Man” proto-“Avengers” thing for Paramount and the brawling steampunk “Sherlock Holmes” series for Warner Brothers — so it is perhaps understandable that he is showing a touch of fatigue. In the new Holmes adventure, “A Game of Shadows,” his imperiousness is hard to distinguish from boredom, and he seems to be in a hurry to spit out his lines, take his lumps, throw his punches and collect his paycheck. 
Can a movie be hyperactive and lazy at the same time? Clever and idiotic? If the director is Guy Ritchie, the questions answer themselves. Like its predecessor “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” confects a smoky, overcast Victorian world, infuses it with an air of jocular, hairy laddishness and stages a lot of fights in fussy and tiresome slow motion. There is a plot, but no real intrigue, mystery or suspense, and no inkling of anything at stake beyond a childish and belligerent idea of fun. 
What a shame. Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective, with his violin, his deerstalker and his steel-trap mind, has been one of the most resilient and adaptable figures in Anglophone popular culture. He has been updated, travestied and conscripted into preposterous tales so many times — including by Doyle himself — that it is silly to hold his character sacred, or to scold Mr. Ritchie for taking liberties. But you would think that a man of such reputed brilliance and erudition (I’m talking about Holmes) would at least know how to pronounce the word “heinous” or use “crescendo” properly in a sentence. And you would think that a brewing showdown between Holmes and his nemesis, Moriarty (Jared Harris), would involve intrigue, suspense and devilish plots and counterplots. 
Not that thinking is in any way relevant. There are a few dabs of sophistication — the witty, walrussy presence of Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s brother; a disquisition on Schubert’s great lieder and a morsel of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” — but these feel random and perfunctory. The real point of the movie is the bantering byplay between Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) punctuated by punches, explosions and action sequences as bloated and pretentious as a 10-minute drum solo on a live album by a second-rate art-rock band from the ’70s. 
Rachel McAdams bustles through the action in a bustle; Noomi Rapace lingers a bit longer in long tresses and Gypsy garb. There is not enough of Eddie Marsan and just enough of Mr. Harris, sneering through a ginger beard, to make you root for the Napoleon of Crime against the foppish fool from Baker Street. Who is oddly mopey this time out, as if needing to reassure us of his sensitive, vulnerable side. 
Poor Sherlock. He is so desperate for attention, so needy — perhaps because of the competition from the likes of Tom Cruise and Tintin — that you are likely to reach the point of exasperation long before Watson does. 
“Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes fisticuffs, explosions, naughty innuendo.

‽
‽Cook County‽,‽“Cook County” opens on a shot of white powder and its maker, Bump (Anson Mount), informing his fellow addicts of the “public service” he’s providing. Flexing biceps no druggie deserves and drawing out his vowels with the deep-throated groan of a creaky barn door, Bump is one of the more despicable cinematic creations of recent years. Worshiping bong, crystals and powder equally, holed up in his isolated East Texas meth lab, he’s the epitome of backwoods sleaze and strung-out self-delusion. 
Sharing Bump’s squalid shack are his teenage nephew, Abe (Ryan Donowho), and Abe’s newly clean father, Sonny (Xander Berkeley), recently returned from a two-year stint in the pokey. Sonny has a pressing secret agenda, but for now he’s happy to help his son snatch Bump’s 6-year-old daughter, Deandra (Makenna Fitzsimmons), from the many precipices created by her father’s questionable child-rearing choices. They won’t always succeed, but Deandra’s role as a symbol of imperiled innocence requires them to try. 
With its twanging soundtrack and timeless shots of convenience store aisles and sniff-and-smoke bacchanals, “Cook County” has a grimy, redneck authenticity. There are fireworks in the yard and tokers in the kitchen, but we don’t need cross-cutting between Bump’s domestic deprivation and the overfilled fridge of his affluent Houston relatives to underscore his muddled priorities. What we need is for the writer and director, David Pomes, to wallow less in aimless dialogue and lowlife sordidness. What we need is a point. 
‽
‽Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked‽,‽There is chipmunk gambling. There is seductive dancing by Chipettes wearing only towels. There is a musical gag involving the lyric “whip my tail back and forth.” How “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked” ended up with only a G rating is a mystery. 
Alvin, Theodore, Simon and the gal pals they picked up earlier in the franchise are back, and their human minder, Dave (Jason Lee), comes up with the not-very-bright idea of taking them on a cruise. (The Carnival line gets perhaps the largest product placement in film history.) 
The whole gang ends up shipwrecked on a tropical island, along with the nefarious Ian (David Cross, who near the end delivers the film’s funniest speech) and lots of references to the Tom Hanks movie “Cast Away” that will elude the 5-year-olds in the audience. 
Also on the island is Jenny Slate (playing a character named Zoe), who may have been exiled there after using the worst possible swear word in her first show as a member of the “Saturday Night Live” cast in 2009. No swear words here; just harmless fun. A particularly nice touch: Some of the ’munks change personalities as a result of a spider bite. Alvin the Responsible? Believe it. 
Noteworthy names provide some of the animated voices — Justin Long, Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler — though that money might have been better spent elsewhere. Once they’re run through the chip-erator, these familiar voices are of course unrecognizable. 
‽
‽My Piece of the Pie‽,‽In “My Piece of the Pie,” Gilles Lellouche, a handsome, rough-around-the-edges French star who could be the next generation’s Gérard Depardieu, nails the essence of a predatory capitalist shark. Having spent 10 years in London, his swaggering character, Stéphane (in England he’s called Steve), is dispatched to Paris to start a hedge fund. Before he leaves, his Mephistophelean mentor counsels, “Business is not a sport for gentlemen; it’s not for good people.” To which Stéphane assures him, “I’m bad!” And he is. 
Watching him operate, you think of the traders in “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room” heard boasting of wreaking havoc with the California power grid for the fun of it. When you’re as young as Stéphane, who is 35, rich and on top of the world, how could it not go to your head? In one scene he gives an online tutorial on how to make a quick 60,000 euros (about $80,000) by betting on currency fluctuations. 
With women he is a charming, selfish rogue who pilots a supermodel to Venice in his private plane, then sulks when she won’t sleep with him because she has to “feel something.” His closest thing to a true love — Mélody (Raphaële Godin), who dumped him after he cheated — is his tough, sexy female equivalent at another brokerage house. He wants her back and whines that it wasn’t cheating because it was only with a call girl, “and that doesn’t count.” When he makes a pass at a woman, he lunges like a famished crocodile. 
Because “My Piece of the Pie,” which was written and directed by Cédric Klapisch, predates the present-day euro crisis, it feels a little behind the curve. Once settled in Paris in a sleek penthouse apartment with a gym, an Eiffel Tower view and a stack of six computer screens beside his desk, Stéphane acquires an attractive housekeeper, portentously named France (Karin Viard). Along with 1,200 others, France lost her job of 20 years when her company in the port city Dunkirk was “iced,” to use one of Stéphane’s favorite words, and the labor outsourced to China. As she later learns to her chagrin, Stéphane masterminded the deal. 
Most of “My Piece of the Pie” is told from France’s point of view. A divorced 42-year-old mother of three adolescent girls, she is a volatile piece of work whose reaction to being fired is a feeble suicide attempt. She is constantly arguing with her spoiled oldest daughter, Lucie (Flavie Bataillie), who shares her highly developed sense of injustice. 
When Stéphane’s ex-wife, without notice, drops off their 3-year-old son, Alban (Lunis Sakji), at the apartment before taking a month’s vacation, he persuades France to be his full-time baby sitter and raises her salary. She also doubles as Stéphane’s arm candy at business functions, where she is instructed to put on a foreign accent when she has to speak. In these scenes “My Piece of the Pie” veers unsteadily from mild social satire to farce. 
To its credit, the movie doesn’t collapse into sentimental mush when Stéphane begins to bond with his frisky little boy. If he displays a glimmer of heart, he doesn’t experience the kind of bogus redemption that a Hollywood movie would demand. Just when you expect the story to settle into a formula, it takes a sharp left turn that makes you question France’s judgment. 
The movie’s tone, like its locations, is continually shifting. At times it suggests a slightly unhinged Gallic answer to “Up in the Air.” As the story races along, it begins to lurch. Stéphane’s dialogue consistently crackles, but the same can’t be said of France’s. She becomes a political scold in her most serious moments. At the same time, she is too emotionally unstable to be a trustworthy moral grounding wire. 
Like Mr. Klapisch’s earlier films “L’Auberge Espagnole” and “Russian Dolls,” “My Piece of the Pie” paints an alluring picture of a pan-European cosmopolitan culture whose characters hopscotch from one country to another with hardly a second thought in a lighthearted floating party. Now, of course, there are alarming signs that the party is about to end.

‽
‽Young Adult‽,‽Shorter than a bad blind date and as sour as a vinegar Popsicle, “Young Adult” shrouds its brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical heart in the superficial blandness of commercial comedy. More radically than “J. Edgar” or even “Greenberg,” this movie, written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman, challenges the dreary conventional wisdom that a movie protagonist must be likable. Along the way, it systematically demolishes a china shop full of shopworn sentimental touchstones about — for starters — high school, small-town life, heterosexuality, Minnesota and the capacity of human beings to change, learn and grow. 
When we first encounter her, Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) seems to have grown, though perhaps not in the most constructive ways. Crossing the treacherous, unmarked boundary between her mid- and late-30s, Mavis has acquired some of the trappings and habits of adulthood. She lives in a spacious, slightly sterile high-rise apartment in Minneapolis (a Midwestern variant on the den of Manhattan anomie that Michael Fassbender’s sex-addled character inhabits in “Shame”) and has, for company, a fuzzy little dog and a big, flat-screen television permanently tuned to some Kardashian or another. 
Eventually we hear about a divorce, though not much about the marriage that preceded it. Mavis supports herself by writing installments in a popular series of “Gossip Girl”-like novels for teenagers, and though her name does not appear on the cover, she derives some creative and professional satisfaction from the job. She drinks a lot, pulls at her hair and seems generally unconcerned with other people. She is pretty, poised and imperious in the way that can come naturally to tall, beautiful, blond women, but also weary and blue — a platinum princess suffering from metal fatigue. 
Looking for a way to break out of her rut and return some luster to her life, Mavis decides to go back to her hometown, Mercury, Minn., and reconnect with her high school boyfriend, Buddy (Patrick Wilson). Just how spectacularly bad this idea is — how packed with vanity, magical thinking and plain, stupid meanness — emerges over the course of a few days, but the warning signs are there from the start. 
Buddy, who is married, has just become a father for the first time. To Mavis, this can mean only that he is trapped in a domestic prison from which she must rescue him. And so she arrives in Mercury intent on breaking up his marriage, a plan she justifies to herself in the romantic language of destiny, soul mates and following your heart. 
That is the native idiom of romantic fiction, both the kind Mavis writes and the genre she appears, at first glance, to inhabit. With sly understatement, Ms. Cody and Mr. Reitman (who previously collaborated on “Juno”) allow a set of comfortable expectations to emerge. We all know — from bad movies like “Cars,” say — that a big-city big shot on a visit to a small town will be constructively humbled by the simple, honest folks who live there. (Or else, as in “Straw Dogs,” terrorized by them). We are also conditioned to believe all kinds of contradictory claptrap about adolescence, which we are supposed to leave behind but also hold onto for (if I may show my own age by paraphrasing John Mellencamp) as long as we can. 
One of the incidental pleasures of “Young Adult” is its specific sense of generational identity. The logos of bands like Black Flag, the Breeders and — of course, this being Minnesota — the Replacements serve as tokens of belonging and signifiers of nostalgia. On the road from Minneapolis to Mercury, Mavis plays an old mixtape (an actual cassette, by the way) from Buddy, fixating on “The Concept” by Teenage Fanclub, which serves as the film’s ambiguous anthem. It evokes warm and affectionate memories, but also, in her case, the pathological inability to let go of the past. 
We assume that a romantic comedy will turn on the redirection of desire from the wrong person to the right one. In one sense — I don’t want to say too much about the details of the plot — this expectation and all the others are met. Mavis does get something of a city mouse’s comeuppance; she does come to difficult terms with her vanished youth; and she does find her attention divided between two guys, the hunk who is her heart’s desire and the nerd who serves as a sympathetic ear and shoulder to cry on. But at the same time, the established codes of modern movie comedy are scrambled and subverted in ways that are puzzling, amusing, horrifying and ultimately astonishing. 
The heroine in “Juno” was briefly dazzled by Jason Bateman’s cool, not-nice guy, but she eventually found her way back to the sweet loser played by Michael Cera. That was impeccable young adult logic, but “Young Adult” itself is a little more complicated, and much harsher. 
Buddy is perfectly nice and not especially cool. The other guy, Matt (Patton Oswalt), is kind of prickly and cool in a geeky way. He makes his own action figures, distills his own bourbon (something Mavis especially appreciates) and has an awesome collection of ’90s indie-rock T-shirts. 
He is also a reminder of the brutal underside of high school, which Mavis chooses to remember as a time of power and glory. Back when she was prom queen, he was in the hospital, having survived a horrific beating that left permanent physical damage. 
And yet Mavis can look at him and complain, without irony, about how much she has suffered in her life. Her cruelty and self-pity are downright shocking. If Ms. Theron hadn’t already appeared in a film called “Monster” (for which she won an Oscar), that title might suit “Young Adult” just as well. 
But even as this movie revels in the punitive spectacle of Mavis’s humiliation, it also extends her a measure of sympathy. Not by justifying her appalling behavior, but rather by treating her honestly. 
Popular culture weaves a tapestry of beautiful lies. “I didn’t want to hurt you,” the Teenage Fanclub vocalist swears, over and over, in the chorus of “The Concept.” The book Mavis is working on (we hear snippets in voice-over) is full of paeans to its heroine’s pluck, luck and intelligence. Big-studio comedies lull us with smiles and fairy tales. The truth, in these circumstances, can be a painful shock, even when it makes you laugh. 
“Young Adult” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Harsh language, bad sex, unpleasant situations — grown-up stuff, in other words.

‽
‽The Sitter‽,‽Noah, the nobody’s fool played by Jonah Hill in the breezily indifferent comedy “The Sitter,” is a character in search of a movie, a setup in search of a punch line. Less directed than doodled by David Gordon Green, this on-and-off funny rehash of “Adventures in Babysitting” centers on a college dropout who, at his mother’s urging, reluctantly agrees to mind three children for pay. Somewhat of a big baby himself, Noah sets off with a pout, apparently unaware that most American excursions in comedy these days come with mandatory opportunities for growth. 
One thing leads to another leads to Noah and his three charges running through the New York night in a misadventure that begins with some broken crockery and, like the sticky ball in the Katamari Damacy video game, gathers progressively larger pieces, including a drug dealer, Karl “with a K” (Sam Rockwell), whose minions include a lisping roller skater, bikinied male bodybuilders and JB Smoove from “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Despite Mr. Hill, his three young co-stars and flashes of Looney Tunes-style anarchy — bursts that bring with them the hope that the movie will spin off its axis, shattering into pure mayhem — much of this is as unfunny as it sounds. 
Some of it, though, is absurdly comic, like the shot of a guy on a Segway that exists for no reason other than that someone here thought the movie could use a small laugh right then. It did. It could use more. The episodic script, credited to Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, doesn’t take any actual risks even when it seems as if the filmmakers are trying to, as in a scene that puts the children in the same car as an exploding package of cocaine, a joke that in an earlier age would have involved a bag of flour. The coke gives an otherwise empty interlude a mild kick, but since the children don’t even sniff the air there’s nothing at stake, including the audience’s sensibilities. 
The children, Slater, Blithe and Rodrigò — played by a winning Max Records, Landry Bender and Kevin Hernandez — suffer neuroses that would make Daffy Duck sputter, but they’re eventually in for some Disney-style homilies. None of the story’s squishiness come as a real surprise, though the thinness of the material and Mr. Green’s apparent willingness to settle for so little do. In the last few years he has pursued a path as a mainstream comedy director with a slightly bent take and a fine cinematographer in Tim Orr, a trajectory that has yielded diminishing returns, first with “Pineapple Express” and then with “Your Highness” and now this. The idea, as Steven Soderbergh has shown, is that you’re supposed to make one movie for you and one for them — not everything for them. 
“The Sitter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence, drugs and raunch.

‽
‽New Year's Eve‽,‽“New Year’s Eve” is a depressing two-hour infomercial pitching Times Square as the only place in the universe you want to be when the ball drops at midnight on Dec. 31. (Believe me, it’s not.) 
When that magic moment arrives, oh-so-many stars converge in a downpour of confetti, although I must warn you that the “Jersey Shore” crowd and the Real Housewives are not among the chosen. 
In this cynical makeover of one of the most stressful nights of the year, no one is visibly drunk or shivering in the cold, and except for a few friendly officers, the police presence is minimal. In homage to V-J Day photos taken in Times Square, some of the kisses exchanged as the year changes are of the back-bending kind. Unctuous platitudes about its being a time of forgiveness and new beginnings regularly stall the movie in its tracks. 
“New Year’s Eve” was directed by Garry Marshall (best known for “Pretty Woman”) from a screenplay by Katherine Fugate. Last year the same team gave us the similarly unendurable “Valentine’s Day.” Like its forerunner, “New Year’s Eve” interweaves more than a half-dozen trivial subplots into a cheerlessly cheery mosaic. The screenplay isn’t written so much as assembled in carefully slotted little blocks, following the rules of a screenwriting textbook. 
The most dramatic fragment involves an electrical glitch in which the crystal sphere gets stuck during a trial run. If it isn’t fixed in time, Claire (Hilary Swank), the officious new vice president of the Times Square Alliance, will lose her job. 
Wan comedy is squeezed out of the competition between two couples for a $25,000 prize to be given to the pair that produces their hospital’s first baby of 2012. Meanwhile, a rock star, Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi), while preparing for a concert, is being punished by his former fiancée, Laura (Katherine Heigl), for having backed out of their commitment a year earlier. Mr. Bon Jovi can’t act but he offers decent performances of “I Can’t Turn You Loose” and “Have a Little Faith in Me.” 
Another cutesy piece involves Randy (Ashton Kutcher), a sarcastic comic-book artist who gets stuck in a stalled elevator with Elise (Lea Michele), one of Jensen’s backup singers whom he offends by asking her if she is a groupie. There is the tired story of Kim (Sarah Jessica Parker), an overprotective mom who refuses to let her 15-year-old daughter, Hailey (Abigail Breslin), go to Times Square to collect her first kiss from a dewy high school crush. 
The hunk factor is supplied by Sam (Josh Duhamel), whose highway mishap on the way to the city nearly prevents him from reuniting with a dream girl he met the previous New Year’s Eve; they promised to reconnect a year later at the same restaurant. But will she show up? 
This is an affair not to remember. It vies for the title of most fatuous subplot with the story of Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former assistant to a record company president, who strikes a deal with Paul (Zac Efron), a bike messenger. If he can make the impossible dreams on her wish list come true, she will give him her tickets to a New Year’s masked ball. 
“New Years Eve” visits Radio City Music Hall and the Queens Museum of Art. It brings in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Ryan Seacrest, and Frank Sinatra is heard singing “New York, New York.” The New Yorkers in this film are predominantly white, middle-to-upper-class Manhattanites, and there is no hardship in sight. The most prominent African-American is a selfless nurse (Halle Berry) who cares for Stan (Robert De Niro) a grizzled photojournalist dying of cancer. Stan’s final wish (I’m not kidding!) is to watch from a hospital roof as the ball drops. 
My advice: don’t believe the hype. Having been there — once — I would nominate Times Square as the last place on earth where most sensible people would want to be when the clock strikes midnight. At home asleep with your head under a pillow to blot out the noise is a much cozier alternative. 
“New Year’s Eve” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some mild innuendo and scattered profanity.

‽One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das‽,‽Meditation is a way to practice letting go of expectations. In that spirit, “One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das” is a fine enough documentary, a nice enough introduction to a charismatic figure with a fascinating life, an unusual art and worldwide fans. 
Still, Maharajji sent him back to the United States and, soon after, died. His devotee then felt lost in grief, wrestling with depression and drugs before remembering his promise to his guru: I will sing for you in America. 
Yet Krishna Das, having reversed his life’s course several times, is no stereotypical mystic: He wears his Long Island heritage as closely as he does his red flannel and red T-shirts (red being popular among followers of the deity Hanuman, who practice service). Casual, humble and appealing, likely to speak obscenities as well as ideas, he is a thoughtful talker in the lengthy, medium-frame shots in this film, and the images of his youth and time in India offer some visual context. 
‽
‽Code of the West‽,‽It’s all about protecting the young people, of course. “We stand to lose a whole generation of kids,” Cherrie Brady, a community advocate, says in “Code of the West.” 
But the whole thing comes down to Lori Burnam, navigating her modest home while attached to various tubes. Marijuana, she says, is the only medication that relieves her pain from cancer and emphysema without incapacitating side effects. Near the end of the film she has to switch to morphine. Burnam died in January.

‽High Tech, Low Life‽,‽Profiling two of China’s so-called citizen reporters, Stephen Maing’s “High Tech, Low Life” offers an inside look at an outsider vocation. 
‽
‽Django Unchained‽,‽“It’s better than ‘Lincoln,’ ” my teenage daughter said, as the end credits rolled at a screening of Quentin Tarantino’s “Django Unchained.” She was teasing me — it’s a sad fact of my life that some of the people I’m fondest of do not seem to share my fondness for Steven Spielberg’s latest movie — but also suggesting an interesting point of comparison. 
“Lincoln” and “Django Unchained,” the one a sober historical drama and the other a wild and bloody live-action cartoon, are essentially about different solutions to the same problem. You could almost imagine the two films, or at least their heroes, figuring in the kind of good-natured, racial-stereotype humor that used to be a staple of stand-up comedy (and was memorably parodied on “The Simpsons”): “white guys abolish slavery like this” (pass constitutional amendment); “but black guys, they abolish slavery like this” (blow up plantation). 
A more substantive contrast might be drawn between the approaches of two filmmakers — both steeped in the history of popular cinema and both brilliant craftsmen whose skill inspires admiration, as well as a measure of suspicion — to a subject full of pain and fraught with peril. Mr. Spielberg, in his ambitious, history-minded projects, hews to the proud (though sometimes mocked) tradition of the Hollywood A picture, in which big themes are addressed with appropriately sweeping visual and emotional gestures. Mr. Tarantino finds inspiration in what are still frequently seen as less reputable genres and styles: Asian martial arts movies, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation. 
Not that you need, at this point, to choose. Among Mr. Tarantino’s achievements has been his successful argument that the maligned and neglected B movies of the past should be viewed with fresh eyes and unironic respect. His own tributes to the outlaw, outsider film tradition — flamboyant in their scholarly care and in their bold originality — have suggested new ways of taking movies seriously. “Django Unchained” is unabashedly and self-consciously pulpy, with camera moves and musical cues that evoke both the cornfed westerns of the 1950s and their pastafied progeny of the next decade. (The title comes from a series of Italian action movies whose first star, Franco Nero, shows up here in a cameo.) It is digressive, jokey, giddily brutal and ferociously profane. But it is also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism. 
As such, “Django Unchained” is obviously a companion to “Inglourious Basterds,” in which Mr. Tarantino had the audacity to turn the Nazi war against the Jews into the backdrop for a farcical, ultraviolent caper. He did not simply depart from the facts of history, inventing, in the title characters, a squad of mostly Jewish-American killers led by a United States Army lieutenant from Tennessee; he rewrote the past in the vivid, visceral language of film fantasy. 
The point of “Inglourious Basterds” was not to engage in counterfactual speculation about a successful plot to kill Hitler, but rather to carry out a vicarious, belated and altogether impossible form of revenge, using the freedom of cinematic make-believe to even the score. 
Like “Inglourious Basterds,” “Django Unchained” is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness. Christoph Waltz, who played the charming, sadistic SS officer Hans Landa in “Basterds,” here plays Dr. King Schultz, a charming, sadistic German bounty hunter (masquerading as an itinerant dentist) whose distaste for slavery makes him the hero’s ally and mentor. 
That hero, first glimpsed in shackles and rags on a cold Texas night in 1858, is Django (Jamie Foxx), who becomes Schultz’s sidekick and business partner. Schultz is an amoral gun for hire, tracking down fugitives and habitually choosing the first option offered in the formulation “Wanted: Dead or Alive.” 
Over time the traditional roles of white gunslinger and nonwhite sidekick are reversed, as the duo’s mission shifts from Schultz’s work to the rescue of Django’s wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). After the couple tried to run away from their former plantation together, they were whipped and branded (the horrific punishment is shown in flashback), and Broomhilda was sold. 
Django and Schultz’s search for her leads them to Candyland, a Mississippi estate whose debonair master, Calvin Candie, is played with almost indecent flair by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is assisted in his savagery by Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), a house slave who may be the most shocking invention in “Django Unchained.” He is an Uncle Tom whose servility has mutated into monstrosity and who represents the symbolic self Django must destroy to assert and maintain his freedom. 
The plot is, by Mr. Tarantino’s standards, fairly linear, without the baroque chronology of “Pulp Fiction” or the parallel story lines of “Inglourious Basterds.” But the movie does take its time, and it wanders over a wide expanse of geographic and thematic territory. 
In addition to Mr. Tarantino’s trademark dialogue-heavy, suspense-filled set pieces, there are moments of pure silliness, like a gathering of hooded night riders (led by Don Johnson), and a late escapade (featuring Mr. Tarantino speaking in an Australian accent) that perhaps owes more to Bugs Bunny than to any other cultural archetype. 
Of course, the realm of the archetypal is where popular culture lives, and Mr. Tarantino does not hesitate to train his revisionist energies on some deep and ancient national legends. Like many westerns, “Django Unchained” latches onto a simple, stark picture of good and evil, and takes homicidal vengeance as the highest — if not the only — form of justice. 
But in placing his story of righteous payback in the Old South rather than the Wild West, and in making its agent a black former slave, Mr. Tarantino exposes and defies an ancient taboo. With the brief and fascinating exception of the blaxploitation movies and a few other works of radical or renegade art, vengeance in the American imagination has been the virtually exclusive prerogative of white men. More than that, the sanctification and romanticization of revenge have been central to the ideology of white supremacy. 
In “Regeneration Through Violence,” his classic study of the mythology of the frontier, from colonial times to the eve of the Civil War, the literary historian Richard Slotkin identifies two essential mythic figures: the captive, usually an innocent woman held against her will by ruthless and alien usurpers, and the hunter, who is obsessed with protecting her honor and, sometimes secondarily, securing her freedom. (“The Searchers,” with John Wayne as the hunter and Natalie Wood as the captive, is perhaps the most sophisticated modern version of this narrative.) 
Broomhilda and Django certainly fit those roles, and yet the roles, historically, were not intended for them. Some abolitionist works like “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” could paint slavery as a form of captivity, but the canonical captives of antebellum American literature were white women kidnapped by Indians, who after the Civil War were often replaced by freed slaves as objects of superstitious terror. The idea that regenerative violence could be visited by black against white instead of the reverse — that a man like Django could fill out the contours of the hunter — has been almost literally unthinkable. 
But think about that when the hand-wringing starts about “Django Unchained” and ask yourself why the violence in this movie will suddenly seem so much more problematic, so much more regrettable, than what passes without comment in “Jack Reacher” or “Taken 2.” Mr. Tarantino is a virtuoso of bloodshed, that is for sure, and also more enamored of a particularly toxic racial slur than any decent white man should be. But decency in the conventional sense is not his concern, though in another sense it very much is. When you wipe away the blood and the anarchic humor, what you see in “Django Unchained” is moral disgust with slavery, instinctive sympathy for the underdog and an affirmation (in the relationship between Django and Schultz) of what used to be called brotherhood. 
So maybe it’s not so different from “Lincoln,” after all. And if “Django Unchained” is not better, it is arguably more radical, both as cinema and as (fanciful) history. A double feature might be just the thing, if you have five and a half hours to spare. By any means necessary! 
“Django Unchained” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Grisly violence (both comical and horrible); vile language (ditto). 
‽
‽Parental Guidance‽,‽“Parental Guidance,” a new comedy with Billy Crystal, is about a minor-league baseball announcer who, after he’s canned for being an old shtick in the mud (he doesn’t tweet), develops a new relationship with his daughter and grandkids. Actually, he teaches everyone a lot of lessons — it’s revenge of the geezer — allowing him to have his curmudgeonly cake and eat it too. Mostly, though, “Parental Guidance” is what families who are desperate to get out of the house over the holidays and need to bridge the generational divide will see after they’ve seen “Les Misérables.” 
It could be worse, and would be without Bette Midler or Marisa Tomei. Ms. Midler plays Diane, the saint married to Mr. Crystal’s Artie Decker. The kooky Diane is first seen, halfheartedly and fully clothed, working a stripper pole in her living room alongside her gal pals. (They seem to have brought their own.) Before Artie’s early retirement can kick in, their daughter, Alice (Ms. Tomei), phones and asks if Grandma and Grandpa can baby-sit her three children while she and her husband, Phil (Tom Everett Scott), take a trip. Diane is delighted, Artie dubious, but they pack up and descend with inappropriate gifts (Artie gives out bobblehead figures of himself), life lessons and a hands-on parenting philosophy that encompasses criminal negligence and Dr. Spock-style common sense. 
Written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse, and directed with snap by Andy Fickman, “Parental Guidance” hits its familiar buttons hard and often. Alice and her family live in a so-called smart house that comes with a talking computer that turns on appliances, greets the family and serves as a strained metaphor for what ails this brood. Alice and Phil have delegated, or perhaps surrendered, some of the basic chores of life to the computer, an early signal that these Apache helicopter parents have created a somewhat inauthentic life for their children. Diane and especially Artie (who’s so technologically clueless he has trouble answering a phone) respond to this newfangled alienation by plying the tots with sugar, a round of kick-the-can and the unaccustomed sound of the word “no.” 
Does it work? You betcha. There are smiles and tears, love and affirmations, a few funny jokes and a lot of easy sentimentality. At one point Artie and Diane sing a song, delighting the children and suggesting that more tunes would have been a nice idea here. Any time Ms. Midler is around, it’s smart to have her sing. She and Ms. Tomei are sympathetic, likable screen presences, but there isn’t much for them to do except smile indulgently at, and be upstaged by, men and children alike. And while this may nominally be a family affair, don’t be fooled for a second: this is Mr. Crystal’s show from opening to close, and he is not especially good about sharing. 
“Parental Guidance” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). But not really required. 
‽
‽Jack Reacher‽,‽“Who are you, Mister?” a young woman asks Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), and it’s a question that recurs, not always quite so politely, throughout the movie that bears Reacher’s name. He may be an elusive individual with a sketchy background — ex-military, no fixed address, a single shirt to his name — but as an archetype he is easy enough to recognize. He is a cousin of Shane and Caine (from the old “Kung Fu” television series) and Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name: a paladin without portfolio who travels from town to town, dispensing righteous violence and hard-boiled aphorisms. 
“It’s just what guys like me do,” Reacher says wearily at one point, though he could say it at just about any point. 
Guys like him are mythical creatures, fantasy figures who dispense rough justice when civic institutions fail. Part comic-book superhero, part Old West vigilante and wholly preposterous, Reacher is far less enigmatic than he or anyone else in the movie thinks he is. And also less interesting. 
Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie and adapted from “One Shot,” the ninth in Lee Child’s series of macho best sellers, “Jack Reacher” brings its hero to Pittsburgh, where a sniper has just shot down five innocent people, including a nanny accompanying a small child, in broad daylight. The suspected shooter (Joseph Sikora) lies in a coma — after scrawling “Get Jack Reacher” on a pad in lieu of a confession — with a seemingly airtight case against him. Shell casings, fingerprints at the scene, security-camera video, all the usual stuff that disciplined television crime-show viewers will recognize as solid circumstantial evidence. 
But the man’s lawyer, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), hires Reacher anyway, possibly because she thinks he might keep her client off death row, and possibly because she, like every other woman in (and presumably beyond) the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is made weak in the knees by Reacher’s off-the-charts sexual magnetism. 
Helen also has some daddy issues, mainly that her daddy (Richard Jenkins) is the district attorney prosecuting the presumed killer. He and the lead detective on the case (David Oyelowo) are obviously too sure of themselves to be trusted, and even before we meet a character known as the Zec (Werner Herzog, whose casting raises a brief film-geek frisson) we know that the poor fellow in the coma is a patsy. We also know, just because of the kind of guy Jack Reacher is, that the body count is sure to rise. 
And so “Jack Reacher” lumbers through a series of beatings, shootings and bludgeonings on its way to a climactic, not terribly surprising showdown. There is a pretty good car chase and a lot of very bad dialogue. Mr. McQuarrie, on his second outing as a director (his screenplays include “The Usual Suspects” and “Valkyrie”), seems more suited to action scenes than to the ostensibly simpler task of filming people talking. Nearly every conversation is stilted and lame, laden with the kind of repartee that might strike you as witty if you had no sense of humor. 
The self-confident, supercompetent Reacher is a character Mr. Cruise could play in his sleep, which is pretty much what he does. Ms. Pike seems a bit more agitated, perhaps because she is too refined an actress for the kind of pulpy sincerity the movie requires. She tries very hard to make sense of Helen’s emotions and motives, which is a hopeless task, since the character is an inexplicable collage of empathy, ambition and neediness, on hand to awaken Reacher’s chivalrous impulses and to quiver with confused desire whenever he is in the room. 
Apart from the car chase, the only real fun in “Jack Reacher” comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall, called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine. They enliven the movie’s atmosphere of weary brutality for a few moments, but they also call attention to the dullness of their dramatic surroundings. 
“Jack Reacher” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Violence and some swearing. 
‽
‽This Is 40‽,‽What’s going on with Pete and Debbie? First of all: You remember Pete and Debbie, don’t you? They were the designated grown-ups played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann in “Knocked Up,” a movie about the accidental conception and hilarious gestation of their niece. If you want an update on that child, who would be in kindergarten by now, you won’t find it in “This Is 40,” Judd Apatow’s “sort-of sequel” to the earlier movie and the fourth feature film he has directed. (The baby’s parents were played by Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, who have moved on to other things.) 
This one is all about Pete and Debbie, who, along with their two daughters, occupy a big white house in one of Los Angeles’s nicer ZIP codes and who, in the course of a hectic week, undergo — well, what, exactly? A matched set of midlife crises? A rough patch in their marriage? A flurry of “first-world problems” so trivial as to be an insult to the planet’s struggling masses? A seminar in postmodern, postfeminist gender politics? Yes, sure, all of that, but to drop their troubles into such neat conceptual boxes would be to simplify a situation that is both agreeably and annoyingly messy. 
All of a sudden — and not, you suspect, for the first time — the stresses of work, parenthood, money and intimacy threaten to add up to something big and scary. Pete’s record label is in financial peril, which he hopes the success of a new album by the British New Wave stalwart Graham Parker will dispel. Debbie, who owns a boutique, suspects that one of her employees (either Charlyne Yi or Megan Fox) is embezzling money. Pete’s father (Albert Brooks) is a noodge and a sponge, constantly borrowing money from his grown son to support his do-over lifestyle, which features rambunctious blond triplets. Debbie’s dad (John Lithgow), who also has a second family, is a chilly, intermittent presence in her life. 
Then there are the adolescent mood swings of Pete and Debbie’s older daughter, Sadie (Maude Apatow), and the skirmishes that break out between Sadie and her irrepressible younger sister, Charlotte (Iris Apatow). 
Hovering over all of this hectic business is something vaguer, deeper and sadder: a malaise in Pete and Debbie’s relationship that leads them to question the foundations of their marriage. In a panic in the wake of a momentous birthday, Debbie embarks on a campaign of family self-improvement, limiting screen time, cooking healthy meals and nagging everyone into a frenzy that almost matches her own. For his part, Pete clowns, mopes and steals away to the bathroom to play with his iPad. 
Cushioned by comforts that most of their fellow citizens can scarcely imagine, they nonetheless feel as if things were starting to go pear-shaped. (Only metaphorically: The two of them are enviably trim, in spite of Pete’s weakness for cupcakes. He bikes a lot.) 
“Do you still even like me?” Debbie asks her husband in one of many moments of vulnerability. 
An entirely plausible answer would be: Who cares? We’ve all got troubles, sister. But I want to suggest that the movie’s ability to foresee — even to welcome — a hostile or indifferent response counts in its favor. “This Is 40” is an intensely, at times embarrassingly, personal film, by a man who has worked hard, lucked out and wants to share some of his happiness and its attendant worries with the rest of us. Mr. Apatow is, quite literally, showing off his lovely wife (that would be Ms. Mann) and their lively, talented daughters, and if Mr. Rudd is not precisely an alter ego (a description that might equally apply to Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and plenty of other male performers in comedies bearing the Apatow brand), he is at least a plausible place holder. He is nice but not cloying, goofy but not dumb, smart but not snotty, and good-looking in a way that doesn’t make the rest of us feel too bad about ourselves. 
Mr. Brooks, a godfather of neurotic, passive-aggressive film comedy, once made a movie called “Defending Your Life.” Mr. Apatow, though he has absorbed some of Mr. Brooks’s deadpan, buried-joke filmmaking style, does not share his penchant for anxious introspection. The social milieu of “This Is 40” is generationally, geographically and professionally adjacent to the one explored by Larry David in “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” but any trace of that show’s self-lacerating misanthropy has been filtered out of the Southern California air. A gaggle of funny troupers — including Melissa McCarthy, Jason Segel, Chris O’Dowd and Lena Dunham — shuffles through the picture, offering up bursts of shtick, but there is more sweetness than cruelty in most of their antics. 
In other words, for all its crude jokes and on-the-money observations of the tastes and consumer habits of aging white Gen X-ers (we still love the Pixies!), “This Is 40” should not be mistaken for satire. While it makes fun of some of Pete’s and Debbie’s foibles and blind spots — his immaturity, her neediness, their complementary ways of not listening to each other — it declines to treat the characters as types or to treat their behavior as symptomatic. 
The audience, of course, is free to take up the slack, to despise Pete and Debbie, even at the risk of hypocrisy. Look at those two, fretting about money, with a BMW and a Lexus in the driveway, the kids in private school and enough left over for a romantic resort getaway and a lavish catered birthday party. 
In a town that runs on philanthropic fund-raisers and celebrity activism, Pete and Debbie support no cause beyond themselves. They are complacent, over-entitled and kind of mean. But the film’s refusal of the detachment that would make them easy targets for judgment is finally a mark of integrity, even generosity. You are brought into a state of intimacy, of complicity, with characters you may find it difficult to like but who, at the same time, require constant affirmation of their goodness. 
And they are good, or at least good enough. So is the movie. It snuggles up next to you, breathes in your face, dribbles crumbs on your shirt and laughs at its own jokes. Such proximity makes it easy to notice flaws, and there are a lot of loose ends and a few forced conclusions. But, then again, the acceptance of imperfection is Mr. Apatow’s theme, so a degree of sloppiness is to be expected. That’s life. 
“This Is 40” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drug use, smoking and swearing. They say it’s the new 20. 
‽
‽The Guilt Trip‽,‽Contrary to what the title and casting might suggest, the Barbra Streisand-Seth Rogen comedy, “The Guilt Trip,” is not “The Shrew and the Cringing Meatball.” There are no screaming accusations, no threats or recriminations, no tearful apologies in this amiable mother-son road odyssey. 
The guilt that Ms. Streisand’s character, Joyce Brewster, lays on her grown son, Andy (Mr. Rogen), a struggling inventor, is larded with enough sweetness and awareness of appropriate boundaries that its humor caresses rather than stings. Joyce’s complaints mostly have to do with Andy’s decision to live 3,000 miles away from her in Los Angeles. When his mother becomes overbearing, Andy, sucking in his lower lip, politely silences her. Joyce, even at her most psychologically invasive, never whines or raises her voice. 
Directed by Anne Fletcher (“The Proposal,” “27 Dresses”) from a pallid screenplay by Dan Fogelman (“Crazy, Stupid, Love”), “The Guilt Trip” is so comfy cozy that mothers and their grown children can watch it together without squirming. Even Joyce’s recollection of the time Andy’s penis turned purple is a zany throwaway remark delivered without a trace of Freudian insinuation. 
What could have been a cutting satirical farce about domineering mothers and emasculated sons is a mildly funny, feel-good love story in which Mom’s sensible advice helps turn around her nerdy son’s foundering career. Although the main characters are softened Jewish stereotypes, there is no mention of religion. 
Andy, who studied organic chemistry at U.C.L.A., is traveling around the country pitching an organic cleaning product he invented that consists of coconut and palm-kernel oils, and soy. You can even drink it. But his presentations are so stiff and jargony that potential backers nod off while he is talking. 
When Andy makes a rare visit to see Joyce in New Jersey, he and his mother begin reminiscing. Joyce remembers her first boyfriend before she married Andy’s father, who died when Andy was 8. She has since had no love life. 
Andy, sleuthing on the Internet, discovers an unmarried corporate executive living in San Francisco who has the same name as that boyfriend. He invites his mother to join him on his eight-day cross-country return trip without telling her of his plan to look up her first love at the end of the journey. Joyce, not knowing his agenda, jumps at the opportunity to be with her only child for several days. 
One bland running joke is Joyce’s obsessive thrift. She insists that they rent a subcompact car instead of an S.U.V., a decision he regrets when they find themselves sandwiched between trucks in an Arkansas blizzard. Joyce also insists that they share the same room in motels and disturbs him with her habit of crunching handfuls of M&amp;Ms while in bed. Since Ms. Streisand, now 70, looks 20 years younger, it is not implausible when one leering motel clerk mistakes them for lovers. But the movie makes little of the confusion. 
Joyce is frisky and game for adventure, and in a Lubbock, Tex., steakhouse she agrees to play beat the clock while consuming a 50-ounce steak. This challenge, which could have been milked for farce, is another missed comic opportunity in a movie so timid it seems afraid of its own shadow. The chief pleasures of this mild-mannered dud lie in watching two resourceful comic actors go through their paces like the pros they are. 
“The Guilt Trip” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild innuendo and some strong language.

‽Trashed‽,‽“This is appalling,” says the actor Jeremy Irons, surveying a reeking mountain of consumer waste fouling a once glorious beach in Lebanon. 
That spoiled shoreline is only one of many revolting sights in “Trashed,” Candida Brady’s down-and-dirty documentary about our inability to neutralize safely much of what we throw away. Taking us on a global tour of escalating rubbish and toxic disposal options, Ms. Brady rubs our faces in the poisonous consequences of littering the planet with substances that, like bedbugs and French mimes, are almost impossible to get rid of. 
But if we must talk trash, Mr. Irons — assisted by a scientist or two and Vangelis’s doomy score — is an inspired choice of guide. Soothing and sensitive, his liquid gaze alighting on oozing landfills and belching incinerators, he moves through the film with a tragic dignity that belies his whimsical neckwear and jaunty hats. Every sterile whale and plastic-choked turtle is a dagger in his heart (and will be in yours too), to say nothing of the farmers ruined by chemically contaminated livestock. 
By the time Mr. Irons visits a Vietnamese hospital for children with severe birth defects — the legacy of Agent Orange — that plastic water bottle in your hand will feel as dangerous as a Molotov cocktail.

‽The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey‽,‽In “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s first Middle-earth fantasy novel, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) sets out with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a posse of dwarfs to battle a fearsome dragon. [Spoiler alert] they do not kill the dragon, although [spoiler alert] they eventually will, within the next 18 months or so, because [spoiler alert] this “Hobbit,” which is [migraine alert] 170 minutes, is the first installment in [film critic suicide-watch alert] a trilogy. 
What’s that old saying so memorably garbled by a recent president? Fool me twice — won’t get fooled again! This is not to say that Mr. Jackson is a con man. On the contrary: He is a visionary, an entrepreneur, a job creator in his native New Zealand. And his “Lord of the Rings” movies, the last of which opened nine years ago, remain a mighty modern gesamtkunstwerk, a grand Wagnerian blend of pop-culture mythology and digital magic now available for easy, endless viewing in your living room. 
“The Lord of the Rings” was the work of a filmmaker perfectly in tune with his source material. Its too-muchness — the encyclopedic detail, the pseudoscholarly exposition, the soaring allegory, the punishing length — was as much a product of Tolkien’s literary sensibility as of Mr. Jackson’s commitment to cinematic maximalism. These were three films to rule them all, and they conjured an imaginary world of remarkable complexity and coherence. This voyage, which takes place 60 years before Frodo’s great quest, is not nearly as captivating. 
Part of this has to do with tone. The “Rings” trilogy, much of which was written during World War II, is a dark, monumental epic of Good and Evil in conflict, whereas “The Hobbit,” first published in 1937 (and later revised), is a more lighthearted book, an adventure story whose comical and fairy-tale elements are very much in the foreground. 
The comparative playfulness of the novel could have made this “Hobbit” movie a lot of fun, but over the years Mr. Jackson seems to have shed most of the exuberant, gleefully obnoxious whimsy that can be found in early films like “Meet the Feebles” and “Dead Alive.” A trace of his impish old spirit survives in some of the creature designs in “The Hobbit” — notably a gelatinous and gigantic Great Goblin and an encampment of cretinous, Three-Stooges-like trolls — but Tolkien’s inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle. 
Also, not to be pedantic or anything, but “The Hobbit” is just one book, and its expansion into three movies feels arbitrary and mercenary. This installment takes Bilbo and his companions, led by the exiled dwarf king Thorin (Richard Armitage), son of Thrain, through a series of encounters with orcs, elves, trolls and other beings, some scarier or more charming than others. The only character who manages to be a bit of both is the incomparable Gollum, once again incarnated by Andy Serkis in what remains an unmatched feat of computer-assisted performance. 
The meeting between Bilbo and Gollum, which takes place in a vast, watery subterranean cavern, is the one fully enchanted piece of “An Unexpected Journey.” It’s a funny, haunting and curiously touching moment that summons the audience to a state of quiet, eager attentiveness. Even if you aren’t aware of the apocalyptic importance of Gollum’s precious ring, you feel that a lot is at stake here: Bilbo’s life and integrity; Gollum’s corroded soul; the fate of Middle-earth itself. 
If only some of that feeling animated the rest of the movie. There are, of course, plenty of shots of noble characters turning their eyes portentously toward the horizon, and much talk of honor, betrayal and the rightful sovereignty of dwarfs over their dragon-occupied mountain. But it all sounds remarkably hollow, perhaps because the post-“Lord of the Rings” decade has seen a flood of lavish and self-serious fantasy-movie franchises. We have heard so many weird proper names intoned in made-up tongues, witnessed so many embodiments of pure evil rise and fall and seen so many fine British actors in beards and flowing robes that we may be too jaded for “The Hobbit,” in spite of its noble pedigree. 
But I don’t mean to blame the cultural situation for the specific failings of the movie, which rises to weary, belated mediocrity entirely on its own steam. Mr. Jackson has embraced what might be called theme-park-ride cinema, the default style of commercially anxious, creatively impoverished 3-D moviemaking. The action sequences are exercises in empty, hectic kineticism, with very little sense of peril or surprise. Characters go hurtling down chutes and crumbling mountainsides or else exert themselves in chaotic battles with masses of roaring, rampaging pixels. 
It seems harder and harder to bring any real novelty or excitement to this kind of thing, though it is not clear how much Mr. Jackson really tries. (“Giants! Stone giants!” someone cries, and a couple of mountains dutifully slug it out.) When the initial rush of a chase or a skirmish dissipates, you are left with the slightly ripped-off feeling of having been here before, but with different costumes, in a “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie or “Clash of the Titans.” 
And near the end, when giant birds arrive to pull “The Hobbit” out of the squall and muck of tedious combat, your pleasure at this soaring aerial tour of New Zealand may be accompanied by a shrug of recognition, since the flight plan retraces the routes of “Avatar” and “How to Train Your Dragon.” 
“The Hobbit” is being released in both standard 3-D and in a new, 48-frames-per-second format, which brings the images to an almost hallucinatory level of clarity. This is most impressive and also most jarring at the beginning, when a jolly dwarf invasion of Bilbo’s home turns into a riot of gluttonous garden gnomes. 
Over all, though, the shiny hyper-reality robs Middle-earth of some of its misty, archaic atmosphere, turning it into a gaudy high-definition tourist attraction. But of course it will soon be overrun with eager travelers, many of whom are likely to find the journey less of an adventure than they had expected. 
“The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Mass slaughter of digital monsters. 
‽
‽The Girl‽,‽It takes a stupid crime and an avoidable tragedy to realize that the title of the American independent movie “The Girl” refers to two people. The first is Ashley (Abbie Cornish), a solitary, thorny rose of Texas who lives in a trailer park and punches a clock at a dead-end job. Her manager favors the Latina workers, or so she believes; worse, her young son, Georgie (Austin Wayne West), has been taken away from her. She visits him soon after the story opens, dropping by the foster home where he lives and that, with its tidy lawn and swing set, looks pretty as a picture. It’s a snapshot of the American dream that seems out of her reach and that will bring her and the second girl trouble. 
The dustiness of the southern Texas town and the cramped modesty of Ashley’s trailer serve as a sharp contrast to the foster home that sits nestled in a suggestively alive, sustaining pocket of green. The director David Riker, working from his own script, sets up “The Girl” nicely. There are early flickers of drama, mostly from a social services worker who checks in on Ashley as well as from talk about a court decision that might reunite her with Georgie. Ashley looks and talks angry, yet even with her periodic outbursts — she yells at Georgie’s caretaker that only money separates her from her son — there’s something amorphous about her rage. There’s next to no urgency to her demeanor and, despite the loss of her son, not a lot that feels worryingly at stake. 
If Ashley can’t settle on a target of her anger it’s perhaps because, as Mr. Riker suggests, that would force her to face tough self-truths. Yet while he makes it clear that she bears some responsibility for her situation, he fills in the bleak contours of her world better than he does those of her interior landscape. This limits Ashley, who, despite her frowns, has none of the hard edges that poverty can bring, none of its scars. She often registers as more petulant than wounded, almost spoiled, and also a bit blank. When her father, Tommy (Will Patton), visiting from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, swings by, laughing like a hyena and splashing booze, he gives the movie a jolt. 
The plot thickens when Ashley learns that he has started smuggling people into the United States. Almost as if on a whim, she tries to do the same. Her efforts go calamitously wrong, and she ends up in Mexico caring for a girl, Rosa (Maritza Santiago Hernández), who has been separated from her mother. Rosa wants her mom and Ashley wants to go home, and while Ashley resists Rosa, her resistance isn’t convincing or long lived. Ms. Cornish is a sympathetic presence, and she turns down her mouth a lot here, but her character’s hardness is a thin coat of lacquer and it chips off fast. What at first came across as a tale of dawning conscience increasingly starts to feel rigged. 
Parked on the banks of the Rio Grande, Nuevo Laredo is one of the busiest borders on the continent; it has also unsurprisingly endured horrifying violence over the past decade. In May the corpses of 23 men and women, presumed victims of gang warfare, were found in the city, some without heads, others hanging from a bridge. Ashley’s father may have moved to Nuevo Laredo (another city plays the role here) because of his illegal pursuits, but his cavalier demeanor when he walks its streets and drinks in its bars rings as false as his smuggling. It’s even harder to buy that Ashley would, even with her hard-luck back story, enter into human trafficking with all the furrowed-brow gravity of a woman buying a new pair of huaraches. 
People do stupid things all the time, on screen and off, and her impulsiveness isn’t beyond the bounds of storytelling reason. The larger problem is that Mr. Riker wants to have his social realism and his sentimental uplift too. The shadowy Mexican streets and the desperate people, Ashley’s bitterness and ghastly carelessness with other people’s lives, pull the movie in a direction that evokes the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (“The Son”), with their stories of moral awakenings. The ease with which Ashley surmounts her terrible choices — as well as her voyage deeper into a Mexico where a saint hands out opportune absolution — regrettably tugs the movie elsewhere. You know that place: it’s where the cost of a white character’s new consciousness is paid for by black and brown lives. 
‽
‽The Fitzgerald Family Christmas‽,‽“The Fitzgerald Family Christmas” manages the considerable feat of interweaving the personal dramas of nine members of a boisterous Irish-American clan into a coherent mosaic with a streamlined narrative drive. This meditation on forgiveness in the season of glad tidings may lose some steam as it speeds to very predictable places, but it doesn’t turn into a tear-stained greeting card plastered with tinsel and stale peppermints. 
This comfortably lived-in movie, written and directed by Edward Burns, offers a textbook example of screenwriting concision. Volumes of information and drama are conveyed with minimal dialogue in a tone so relaxed and offhand you hardly notice the painstaking craftsmanship that went into it. 
Mr. Burns shuffles this dense material with the dexterity of a card shark. The pace, although swift, is never rushed. The writing and acting give you vivid enough tastes of the characters — there are seven children, two parents, and assorted spouses, lovers and friends — so that each registers as a singular flavor. 
The ensemble includes some of the same actors from Mr. Burns’s directorial debut in 1995, “The Brothers McMullen,” which won an Independent Spirit Award for best first feature and the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Together, the actors convincingly evoke the familial and social bonds connecting working-class Irish-Catholic Long Islanders. 
If “The Fitzgerald Family Christmas” revisits the world of “The Brothers McMullen,” the names have changed, and Mr. Burns is stouter and ruddier than he was 17 years ago. He plays Gerry Fitzgerald, the self-appointed peacemaker and surrogate father figure of a quarrelsome, high-spirited brood of grown-up children he tries to corral for the 70th birthday of their mother, Rosie (Anita Gillette). That birthday falls two days before Christmas, and Rosie, who doesn’t like birthdays, seems not to mind when her children find reasons not to attend. 
Gerry, his mother’s darling, owns a nearby tavern and has lived at home since an unspecified tragedy related to Sept. 11. Twenty years earlier his father, Jim (Ed Lauter), abandoned the family. Now Jim, who is broke and ailing, is pestering Gerry to persuade Rosie to allow him to join the family for Christmas dinner. When Jim walked out, leaving her to rear the last four of the seven children by herself, she vowed he would never set foot in her home again. 
Rosie may be resilient and feisty, but Ms. Gillette’s wonderful performance recognizes the depth of her stored-up hurt and anger. She is reluctant to believe Jim’s claim that he is dying of pancreatic cancer and has only months to live. 
Besides Gerry, the more sharply etched characters include his new possible sweetheart, Nora (Connie Britton), the serene caregiver for a friend of Rosie’s; and his hot-tempered brother Quinn (Michael McGlone), who fancies younger women. A sister, Sharon (Kerry Bishé), gravitates toward older men, the latest of whom, nicknamed F X (Noah Emmerich), is a wealthy playboy with a house in the Hamptons. 
The others include Gerry’s frightened youngest brother, Cyril (Tom Guiry), who is just out of rehab and faces an uncertain future; his sister Connie (Caitlin Fitzgerald), whose abusive, unemployed partner, J J (Dara Coleman), explodes when she tells him she is pregnant; Erin (Heather Burns), her father’s favorite, who has married outside the Roman Catholic faith; and an imperious oldest sister, Dottie (Marsha Dietlein Bennett), who has left her husband to hook up with her much younger gardener (John Solo). 
The Fitzgeralds’ collective problems aren’t much worse than those of any other large family. And the movie’s attitude is mostly nonjudgmental. Its moral fulcrum is the question only Rosie can answer: Should she allow Jim back into the fold? As that is debated throughout the film, with all points of view taken into account, “The Fitzgerald Family Christmas” addresses the meaning of family ties with a bracing emotional honesty.

‽Farewell to Hollywood‽,‽Rendering a verdict on the cinematic merits of “Farewell to Hollywood” seems beside the point or even inappropriate; the movie’s key attribute is that it exists. The co-director, Regina Nicholson, died of cancer at 19 in 2012. She is shown expressing a wish that the documentary about this period in her life “survive and be fantastic.” 
Mr. Corra eventually became involved in Ms. Nicholson’s medical care. There are passages — especially the finale — that suggest he lacked perspective in editing. The movie continues through several possible closing moments.

‽Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago‽,‽The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, where, legend holds, the Apostle James is buried, has drawn pilgrims since the Middle Ages. So it’s not as if the most popular Camino de Santiago, the 500-mile Camino Francés, which starts at St.-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the Pyrenees, needs any publicity. Still, “The Way,” Emilio Estevez’s 2011 film about four modern-day hikers — one played by his father, Martin Sheen — introduced many to the trek and its meditative pleasures. 
‽
‽Justin Bieber's Believe‽,‽The key moment in “Justin Bieber’s Believe,” the new hagiographical film, comes in the second half, in a segment that touches ever so lightly upon Mr. Bieber’s tumultuous public image over the last year. The scene is London, last March: A small cluster of paparazzi is egging Mr. Bieber on, and he takes the bait, jumping at the photographers and being held back by a bodyguard. At least half of the conversation (on both sides) is bleeped. 
That said, films like this work best when exalting is the task, and when it comes to displaying Mr. Bieber in his milieu — onstage — it shines. The footage is arresting and crisp, and Mr. Bieber is in his element: He’s not the most outgoing pop star, but he has the requisite attitude, and his mild cool comes through clearly. 
If it’s that, then the secondary interviews with Mr. Bieber’s intimates, all of which have just a touch of black cloud hovering overhead, are extra resonant. Scooter Braun, Mr. Bieber’s manager, describes this star’s journey as “a constant search for validation.” Usher speaks of Mr. Bieber’s fans as his “moral compass.” And the producer Rodney Jerkins, while praising Mr. Bieber’s abilities, acknowledges that he has experienced only victory thus far: “He doesn’t really understand what the loss looks like.”  
‽
‽The Wolf of Wall Street‽,‽Future archaeologists, digging through the digital and physical rubble of our long-gone civilization in search of reasons for its collapse, will be greatly helped if they unearth a file containing “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Martin Scorsese’s three-hour bacchanal of sex, drugs and conspicuous consumption. Then as now, the movie is likely to be the subject of intense scholarly debate: Does it offer a sustained and compelling diagnosis of the terminal pathology that afflicts us, or is it an especially florid symptom of the disease? 
After meeting Jordan at his saturnalian peak, we flash back to his beginnings as an eager newbie at a reputable firm, where he is introduced to the mysteries and pleasures of the trade by a gleefully Mephistophelean Matthew McConaughey. This is less a fall from grace than a rite of passage, and after the crash of 1987 flushes Jordan out of the real Wall Street, he finds a way to recreate its worst and most attractive aspects. Taking inspiration from a storefront penny-stock outfit, he conjures up a high-profile company with the fake blue-blood name of Stratton Oakmont. 
Anyway, what makes “The Wolf of Wall Street” a vital and troubling document of the present is not so much Jordan’s business plan — he tells us repeatedly that it’s too complicated and boring to explain — as his approach to life. It’s a truism that every salesman sells himself, and as Stratton Oakmont grows, Jordan becomes an evangelist of easy money and unbridled pleasure. The ambitious brokers who flock to its trading floor are lured by the promise of huge bonuses and endless debauchery, but their enterprise is held together, above all, by the boss’s charisma.  
What they do is consistently appalling and sometimes very funny. The comedy in “The Wolf of Wall Street” can be deliciously brutal — an extended sequence in which Jordan and Donnie are so blitzed on Quaaludes that they can barely move is sure to join Mr. Scorsese’s greatest-hits reel — but the movie laughs with Jordan as well as at him. And, intentionally or not, it makes a fetish of his selfish bad-boy lifestyle. 
‽
‽47 Ronin‽,‽Between the prospect of Hollywood’s sexing up a legendary Japanese story with rampaging C.G.I. monsters and the eager reports of a protracted production, there has been ample opportunity to hobble “47 Ronin” long before its warriors finally emerge in theaters. But say what you will about this fantasy adventure, set in “a land shrouded in mystery” (per the opening voice-over), it’s still a studio movie adaptation of a story that ends — centuries-old spoiler! — with mass ritual suicide. Credit due for that bit of faithfulness, I suppose — and Merry Christmas, by the way. 
Providing fodder for fanciful special effects and 3-D imagery are a shape-shifting witch (Rinko Kikuchi, in an unsteady vamp), who helps Kira using extravagant conjurings, and a back story for Kai in an enchanted forest (apparently named after folkloric creatures called tengu). The lushly designed beasts and careening chases are what you might expect from the film’s director, Carl Rinsch, who is making his feature debut after creating advertising work and a viral short featuring, well, robots and chases. All these flourishes may reflect anxiety over whether the shame- and honor-based narrative would hold the attention of Americans, but they can be diverting. 
There’s a sober pace to this sometimes picturesque film: The dutifully arranged action building blocks and the meager story filler are ploddingly punctuated by landscape shots. But “47 Ronin” can’t entirely paper over the void at its center, traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering. (Reshoots reportedly occurred, with changes including the placement of Mr. Reeves’s character at the center of a climactic battle with a dragon.) 
‽
‽The Secret Life of Walter Mitty‽,‽As imagined by Ben Stiller, Walter Mitty is a man out of step with his time. An archetypal daydreamer introduced to the public by James Thurber as a henpecked suburban husband and later impersonated on screen by Danny Kaye as a misunderstood, starry-eyed sweetheart with a lovely singing voice, Walter has evolved into a modern office drone with an unusually active fantasy life. He is also, in some respects, the opposite of just about every other comic hero in American movies today, including many played by Mr. Stiller. And “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” directed by Mr. Stiller (who takes the title role), has a dreamy, melancholy tone quite different from what you might expect to find in a big-budget holiday comedy.  
It also, somewhat more riskily, tries to fold the kind of playful, wide-eyed high spirits familiar from the “Night at the Museum” movies into what is in effect a midlife melodrama. This is Walter Mitty by way of Marty, the soulful Bronx butcher played by Ernest Borgnine in the 1955 film that won the Oscar for best picture. Walter’s most notable trait is the one that everyone else undervalues or takes for granted: his goodness. Walter is a low-key suitor, and Cheryl is drawn to him for his thoughtfulness and quiet sense of humor rather than for the alpha-male derring-do he secretly possesses. In one funny, poignant scene, he executes a series of impressive skateboard moves — real, not imaginary — while her back is turned. But showing off like that would be out of character in any case. 
‽
‽Grudge Match‽,‽Old jocks never die; they just team up. One veteran action hero may not be able to open a movie nowadays, but put two or more shoulder to shoulder in the same film, as in the “Expendables” series, and there’s gold to be mined and a senior male fan base to be activated. That’s the shrewd marketing philosophy behind “Grudge Match,” the overlong, drab, not-so-funny sports comedy that teams Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro as onetime boxing champions in an unlikely rematch 30 years after their last bout. Rocky versus the Raging Bull; how about that for a tagline?  
What reunites them is a television special about their history that prompts a video game company to use their images. At a promotional event, taunts are exchanged and a fight breaks out. Caught on video, the scene goes viral on YouTube, and public pressure mounts for an actual rematch. Promising big bucks, Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), the son of the promoter who squandered Razor’s earnings, coaxes them back into the game. Standing blankly in the middle of the fray is Sally (Kim Basinger), the blonde who got between Razor and Billy in their glory days.  
“Grudge Match,” directed by Peter Segal (“Get Smart” and the 2005 remake of “The Longest Yard”) from a story by Tim Kelleher, who wrote the screenplay with Rodney Rothman, is more of an outline than a fleshed-out narrative. The back story, especially the romantic part, has no resonance. Ms. Basinger, now 60, is ravishing, but her character registers as little more than a speck in a PowerPoint presentation.  
Programs like Cenegenics and slogans like “70 is the new 50,” not to mention erectile dysfunction medications, now dominate the senior male market in our never-say-die culture. Testosterone rules, as the grunts and bellows of Rocky Balboa and his ilk echo into eternity.

‽Personal Tailor‽,‽“What you don’t dare imagine, we dare to do” is the motto of the dream team known as “Personal Tailor,” a fantasy fabrication service (led by Ge You and Bai Baihe) that provides wealthy clients with a taste of the lives they have always wanted. No request is too outlandish (the “Custom Martyrdom Package” will furnish you with a simulated Nazi interrogation, hunger strike optional) or too elaborate, even if the outcomes are not always as planned.

‽All the Light in the Sky‽,‽The cosmic and the microscopic are casually — and delicately — juxtaposed in “All the Light in the Sky,” an evocative, slightly melancholic movie directed and photographed by the prolific mumblecore auteur Joe Swanberg. This portrait of a middle-aged actress in Los Angeles who makes a decent living as a Hollywood bit player but worries about the future, is bolstered by the astoundingly natural performance of Jane Adams (“Happiness,” “Hung”). Her chipper, articulate character, Marie, is 45 and acutely aware of her professional shelf life. She lives in a comfortable Malibu home on stilts that hugs the Pacific Coast.  
Without preaching, “All the Light in the Sky” poses questions that are worth asking, even if we know the answers. Why do people build houses that they know will eventually be swallowed by the sea? How do we keep up our spirits with the realization that no matter what we do, there is no turning back the clock? Is it possible to deal with the future when it’s all you can do to savor the beauty of the moment?  
‽
‽Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues‽,‽“Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues” is in danger of being overshadowed by its own marketing campaign. The recent media appearances by Ron Burgundy — impersonated, if you need reminding, by Will Ferrell — have the quality of commercial performance art. He has been ubiquitous, hawking Dodge Durango trucks, accepting a tribute from a journalism school and matching wits with members of the profession he exists to lampoon. That television news has so eagerly embraced Ron Burgundy may be evidence that the “Anchorman” movies don’t go far enough, satirically speaking. The man may be a vain, ethically obtuse, generally clueless buffoon, but it would not occur to him to allow a fictional character on his air to sell a product. He’s no George Stephanopoulos. 
It has all stayed classy, even if it’s not such a big deal anymore. This time, as the ’70s shade into the ’80s, offering new wardrobe and song-cue opportunities, Ron and his pals find themselves present for the birth of 24-hour cable news. Ron and his wife, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), have a young son (named Walter, as in Cronkite, played by Judah Nelson), but their relationship hits a snag when she is promoted over him at the network that moved them out of San Diego. Ron, his male pride wounded and his professional dignity challenged, goes into a tailspin that is halted when a cable producer (Dylan Baker) recruits him for a new all-news-all-the-time venture. “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard,” Ron exclaims. That may be the smartest thing he has ever said. 
The movie traces the mythic origins of the worst of modern cable news — the mindless jingoism, the split-screen shouting, the cluttered graphics, the breathless coverage of car chases and celebrity nonsense — to Ron’s initiative. “I’m the one who opened the bottle and let the genie out,” he says proudly. But the whole point of the “Anchorman” franchise has always been that you can’t stay mad at this guy. You can almost imagine — or at least wish — that the real people responsible for the coarsening of civic discourse are just dumb and lovable, rather than greedy and evil. Ron may be sexist, pompous, politically insensitive and hideously dressed, but Mr. Ferrell, with his lumbering frame and twinkling eyes, always tugs him back toward cuddliness.  
Which is not to say that Brick and Chani should have their own movie. Too much of any one thing would spoil the fun of the whole, which depends on quick transitions from one setup to the next and an overall sense of anarchic busyness. “Anchorman 2” supplies that, as expected, even as it also feels like old news.

‽Paradise: Hope‽,‽Hallelujah! Who knew that the Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl actually has a heart? You might not have guessed that if all you have seen of his work are his punishing examinations of bourgeois Austrian life, “Dog Days” (2001) and the first two parts of his “Paradise” trilogy, released this year.  
Anna Maria, who cultivates an imaginary affair with Jesus, prays to the same crucifix with which she masturbates while flagellating herself.  
With an unblinking realism, “Paradise: Hope,” like Mr. Seidl’s previous films, contemplates the tyranny of what is nowadays sometimes referred to as “body fascism” in a society that holds out nearly impossible ideals of beauty and youth. His movies force us to contemplate the weakness of the flesh and our susceptibility to desire with eyes wide open.  
‽
‽American Hustle‽,‽Irving Rosenfeld, the con man running the great scam in “American Hustle,” isn’t, his mistress admits, much to look at. He has a belly the size of a beer keg and a torturously complicated comb-over that he arranges with the fastidiousness of a Michelin-starred pastry chef. Appearances are not everything to Irving (Christian Bale), but rather just part of the swindle that is his life’s work, his passion and genius. The confidence game is his honey pot: It’s what lines his pockets, lights his fire and cigars, and has transformed the mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), into his equal in theft and dissimulation, making her the Rosalind Russell to his Cary Grant in a romp that’s pure Scorsese screwball.  
The movie tracks the scandal primarily from the points of view of Irving and Sydney, whose he-said, she-said voice-overs are interspersed with adenoidal dispatches from his stay-at-home wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). After setting the contemporary scene, Mr. Russell cuts back to Irving’s childhood, sketching in the con man’s background with brief, funny scenes and a devil-may-care take on criminality that pointedly mirrors the trajectory of Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese’s “GoodFellas.” Like Paul Thomas Anderson, whose period bacchanal “Boogie Nights” also borrows from “GoodFellas,” Mr. Russell is a cinematic Son of Scorsese. Yet while his swooping cameras and motor-mouth characters follow in the virtuosic wake of Mr. Scorsese, they’re equally beholden to Mr. Scorsese’s own influences, including the Golden Hollywood likes of the director Raoul Walsh.  
Mr. Scorsese once called Walsh’s 1939 post-World-War-I crime film, “The Roaring Twenties,” a “twisted Horatio Alger story,” a thumbnail description that also fits “American Hustle.” Corrupt politicos and a federal Venus’ flytrap give the movie a veneer of topicality, and there’s plenty in it that matches up with the historical record, including the role played by Irving’s true-crime counterpart, a Bronx-born swindler named Mel Weinberg. Even so, Mr. Russell doesn’t seem all that interested in veracity, and the movie opens with a playful assurance that “some of this actually happened,” a declaration that feels calculated to block off-point objections that some of it didn’t happen. Details have been changed, and everyone, as is often the case in movies, looks younger and prettier, less lumpy and beaten down by life than the original players, even Irving and his magnificently tragic, trumped-up hair. 
Once Irving’s and Sydney’s back stories are set in place, the movie is off and running. The two join forces personally and professionally after meeting at a party where Irving — resplendent in swimming trunks, gold chains nestling in a thatch of chest fur and a stomach that suggests he’s far into his third trimester — works his magic. Mutually smitten, they begin swindling desperate people who, unable to secure legitimate bank loans, hand over wads of cash in hopes of receiving bigger advances. One mark turns out to be an F.B.I. agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper, very good), who uses them to run a bigger con, one he hopes will bag politicians like a New Jersey mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner, excellent), whose decency is tested by his ambitions.  
Or perhaps Mr. Bale found pathos in Irving and dignity in this small, striving, vulgar man’s life. Whatever the reasons, Mr. Bale, like some other stars who embrace playing ugly, feels as if he’d been liberated by all the pounds he’s packed on and by his character’s molting looks, an emancipation that’s most evident in his delicately intimate, moving moments with Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence. Hilarious and brassy, by turns reminiscent of Jean Harlow and Judy Holliday, Ms. Lawrence is a bountiful delight even in a smallish role, partly because of her magnetism and partly because Mr. Russell is one of the few American male directors working today who’s as interested in women as he is in men. This may be about a famous federal sting, but, like all of his movies, it’s also a love story (or two).  
As Irving’s other better half, Ms. Adams, a virtuoso of perkiness, goes deeper here than she’s ever been allowed to. She showed an indelibly darker, more dangerous side in a supporting role in Mr. Anderson’s “Master,” playing Lady Macbeth to a cult leader; she has a lot more to do in “American Hustle.” Like Irving, Sydney is a self-invention, one containing multitudes, from the former stripper she starts off as, to the elegant British noblewoman she pretends to be for the couple’s loan scams. With her bright eyes and alabaster gleam, Ms. Adams can look like a porcelain doll, a deceptive mien that helps complicate Sydney and turns an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one, whose ordinary scream is the howl of a wolf.  
‽
‽The President‽,‽The Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf (“A Moment of Innocence,” “Kandahar”) is not known for his kineticism, but “The President” — which he has suggested is his comment on the Arab Spring — has surprising urgency and sweep. The film is set in an unknown country (everyone speaks Georgian), where a dictator (Misha Gomiashvili) thinks nothing of approving a teenager’s execution in front of his grandson (Dachi Orvelashvili), who looks to be about 5. He then invites the child to play a game: They’ll turn the power on and off in the city below the presidential palace. 
Suddenly, revolution erupts. With the rest of the family evacuated, the two find themselves in continual danger. Some of the strongest filmmaking occurs in the first half-hour, as Mr. Makhmalbaf trails the presidential limousine through riots, bullets and flames. Soon, with a bounty on his head, the president burns his uniform, trims his hair and dons a wig, passing himself and his grandson off as street musicians. 
At times — as when a soldier under the new regime rapes a bride in her wedding dress — the movie flirts with a false equivalence, suggesting that postrevolutionary life is just as cruel as totalitarianism. The actual moral of the story is more trite and utopian, but still powerful: Democracy can’t take root until the impulse for vengeance is gone. 
‽
‽The Hand That Feeds‽,‽Films about labor relations don’t always need the massive scale of “Harlan County, U.S.A.” (1976), which watched a miners’ strike unfold. The advocacy documentary “The Hand That Feeds” chronicles organizing efforts at a Hot &amp; Crusty on Second Avenue at 63rd Street in Manhattan. (Some material shot for the film was adapted into a New York Times Op-Doc in 2013.)

‽Barbecue‽,‽Eric Lavaine’s “Barbecue,” a French comedy about a circle of middle-age friends facing mild irritations, is the kind of utterly unremarkable local product that doesn’t usually get an American release. But its loosely written story doubles as a smirk-inducing glimpse at what feel like very Gallic life challenges. 
But Mr. Wilson’s Antoine is too much of a pill to root for, and the voice-over and wispy songs dribbling over scenes only underline the forgettable filmmaking. But hurrah for the use of a game of pétanque (pronounced pay-TONK, it’s a lawn game akin to Italian bocce ball) to illustrate the joie de vivre of a woman separated from her husband.  
‽
‽Into the Woods‽,‽“Into the Woods,” the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for “children of all ages.” That usually translates to mean only children and their doting parents. But with “Into the Woods,” you grow up with the characters, young and old, in a lifelong process of self-discovery. 
Mr. Sondheim’s great song “No One Is Alone” is a double-edged lullaby. It acknowledges that everyone is ultimately alone, although the shared understanding of that isolation makes life bearable. 
The movie shows remarkably few signs of the sweetening and dumbing down that might have been expected, given the Disney factory’s philosophy of gratifying wishes but adding just enough darkness to make the light seem brighter. I suspect that the success of “Frozen” may have persuaded the company to modify its traditional formulas to allow more realism and ambiguity, which is all to the good. 
Rapunzel and the witch are not the movie’s only parent and child in conflict. Jack and his strict mother (Tracey Ullman), irate that he traded a cow for some magic beans, are continually at odds. The characters closest to their fairy tale origins are Cinderella’s stepmother (Christine Baranski) and stepsisters, Florinda (Tammy Blanchard) and Lucinda (Lucy Punch). With the exception of the giant and a wolf (a sensational Johnny Depp) who stalks and devours Little Red Riding Hood, these mean girls and their avaricious mom are the only genuine baddies. 
Everyone else is shaded somewhere between good and evil. Even Ms. Streep’s vindictive hag is not entirely wicked. When a curse is lifted, and her beauty is restored, she is a dead ringer for Miranda Priestly, Ms. Streep’s regal fashion maven in “The Devil Wears Prada.” Ms. Streep’s warm performance gives the witch, even at her most fearsome, a twinkle of good humor that draws you to her. And her climactic meltdown, “Last Midnight,” is a vocal and dramatic tour de force. 
And “Children Will Listen” distills what might be called the gospel according to Sondheim: 
‽
‽The Gambler‽,‽In “The Gambler,” a movie about a guy who’s a glutton for criminally high stakes and for punishment, a skeletonized Mark Wahlberg wears a mop of greasy hair and an abject look. In some scenes, he looks crushed and lost, like a wadded scrap of paper that fell short of the garbage bin. It soon becomes clear why. His character, Jim Bennett, hit the literary jackpot years ago with a well-received first and only published novel. Now Jim splits his time between teaching college — say hello to Professor Wahlberg — and betting and losing at gaming tables, some in underworld parlors around a Los Angeles that’s been Michael Mann-ed into a smear of throbbing color and would-be existential dread.  
“The Gambler” is based on the terrific lowdown and gritty 1974 movie of the same title starring James Caan. That film was beautifully directed by Karel Reisz from James Toback’s script about his experience as a gambler and college lecturer; the new one was directed by Rupert Wyatt from a screenplay by William Monahan, who also wrote Martin Scorsese’s Academy Award windfall “The Departed.” Without a script in hand, it’s tough to tell how significant a contribution a writer makes to a movie, what was retained or changed from page to screen. All that’s clear in this “Gambler” is that almost everything that makes the original so pleasurably idiosyncratic, from its daft ideas to the peekaboo bear rug spread over Mr. Caan’s often-bared chest, has been expunged from the remake.  
The story mostly involves Jim’s consuming passion with gambling and, in a quasi-Freudian move, learning to transfer that libidinous energy to a dubiously healthier object, in this case one of his young students, Amy (an underused Brie Larson). Mr. Monahan may have lifted the teacher-student liaison from Dostoyevsky’s biography and novelist’s relationship with a much younger woman. That’s moderately interesting, but it doesn’t mean anything for Amy (or Ms. Larson), who does little more than look intently at Jim when he’s jumping around the lecture hall or laying down some heavy thoughts. Ms. Larson holds your eyes and interest, but she’s as ornamental as the stick figure played by Lauren Hutton in the 1974 film.  
Mr. Wyatt’s direction is smooth, although he’s more confident, and the movie more convincing, when he goes for baroque with the story’s excesses, like cutting loose with the cartoonish villains played by Alvin Ing, Jessica Lange, Michael Kenneth Williams and John Goodman. The problem is that Jim (and Mr. Wahlberg) never joins the fun. A congenitally likable screen presence, Mr. Wahlberg handles the movie’s streaming words like the rapper he once was, and he sometimes cocks an eyebrow as if acknowledging the absurdity of it all. Mostly, his character is sad, sincere and heavy, and his performance is, too, even when Jim whips out some eyeglasses the first time he enters his classroom. When Marilyn Monroe pulled that kind of stunt it was comedy gold, but it just makes Jim and Mr. Wahlberg look silly.  
‽
‽Big Eyes‽,‽A horror movie tucked inside a domestic drama wrapped up in a biopic, Tim Burton’s “Big Eyes” tells the story of Margaret Keane, an artist whose characteristic style is summed up in the title. 
How this arrangement came about — and how it fell apart — is Mr. Burton’s main concern. Margaret arrives in San Francisco in flight from a bad first marriage, accompanied by her daughter, Jane (Delaney Raye as a young child, Madeleine Arthur as a teenager). The world is an unfriendly place for a single mother, and the city, shot in bright, saturated colors (by Bruno Delbonnel), has a lurid creepiness that suggests Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” an impression underlined by Ms. Adams’s blond, slightly chilly vulnerability. 
Walter Keane, speaking of creeps, seems at first to be an ebullient, free-spirited charmer. He seems that way to Margaret, anyway. The rest of us, recognizing Christoph Waltz, will suspect other, less amusing dimensions to the character. A Sunday painter who claims to have studied in Paris, Walter, who works in commercial real estate, encourages Margaret’s creativity and offers security for her and Jane, whose father is threatening to sue for custody. The new couple exhibit their work in a nightclub (owned by the great scene-stealer Jon Polito), and when Margaret’s forlorn children attract more attention than Walter’s Parisian street scenes, he starts to claim them as his own. 
Walter is a mediocre artist — if that — but he does have a genius for self-promotion. Intuiting the Warholian spirit of the times, he pushes the boundary between art and commerce, turning his surname and his wife’s talent into a powerful and ubiquitous brand. He is helped by a gullible newspaper columnist played by Danny Huston. Though “Big Eyes” is entirely on Margaret’s side, especially as her husband’s sadistic, controlling behavior comes to the forefront, it depends on Walter’s manic, devilish energy. Ms. Adams’s performance is sensitive and subtle, but the film can’t quite figure out what to do with her character’s passivity. Trying to do Margaret justice, Mr. Burton can’t prevent himself (and Mr. Waltz) from upstaging her. 
A more intriguing ambiguity has to do with the value of Margaret’s work. Terence Stamp shows up briefly as John Canaday, a real-life New York Times critic who attacked the selection of a large-scale Keane painting called “Tomorrow Forever” for the 1964 World’s Fair. Canaday (a Kansas native here depicted as an imperious patrician with an ascot and a British accent) exposed Walter Keane’s hucksterism but also trashed Margaret’s art as “the very definition of tasteless hack work.” 
Is that judgment altered by the knowledge that the paintings, rather than emerging from a self-promoting man’s supposed encounters with orphans in postwar Berlin, sprung from the unconscious of a self-effacing woman? This is not a simple question, and it is one that Mr. Burton toys with to intriguing effect. In his magnificent “Ed Wood,” the director cast a sympathetic eye on a widely reviled filmmaker, exploring the ambition and integrity behind some of the worst movies ever made. 
‽
‽Unbroken‽,‽Angelina Jolie opens “Unbroken” with a shot of a celestial blue sky that soon darkens with a battle scene so tense and fluidly choreographed that you quickly sense that, as a director, she leans closer to hell than heaven. She has given herself plenty to work with: The movie takes a slice out of the life of Louis Zamperini, the Olympic runner turned World War II bombardier who, after surviving a plane crash and 47 days adrift on the Pacific, was fished out of the water by a Japanese patrol boat and then imprisoned in camps where he was brutalized for years. His is one of those stories that has come to define the Greatest Generation.  
Ms. Jolie is a fast worker. After her inaugural nod at the wide blue yonder, she thrusts you inside the claustrophobic confines of a B-24 bomber that’s soon under Japanese attack. There, the adult Louie, as he was called, bounces through the plane while bullets begin shredding its exterior and soon its occupants, the fusillade opening little circles of light in the hull as effortlessly as a pencil punches holes in paper. It’s a shrewd opener, because it immediately puts you on notice in regard to the story’s life-and-death stakes and draws you close to Louie (the appealing Jack O’Connell). Mr. Zamperini was a distance runner, but here he’s a sprinter whose quicksilver movements — he crouches and scuttles while tending the wounded plane and men — suck you in with gravitational force.  
Louie’s life moves so rapidly here that about 30 minutes after the movie’s start, he’s running laps at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. There, he catches a glimpse of Jesse Owens and gawps at the cheering crowds and bloated Nazi spectacle, which Ms. Jolie conveys with digital effects and a touch of Leni Riefenstahl pomp-and-creepiness. Then Louie’s off to the races, and we’re off to something of a narrative cheat. He scores mightily on the track — with a rabbity final sprint — but Ms. Jolie pumps the inspirational uplift so high that with all the soaring music, swirling camerawork, excited commentary and slow-motion shots of Louie’s straining and gasping you may not realize he didn’t win any Olympic medals.  
It took four marquee writers — Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson — to wrestle Ms. Hillenbrand’s many pages into a movie, which clocks in at 2 hours 17 minutes. That’s scarcely enough time for any life, but it’s impossible when each chapter in that life could itself be a book (including an underplayed epiphany), and the strain shows, especially in the camp sequences. Ms. Jolie does fine work throughout, including on the raft where, after the crash, Louie and two others, Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock), battle dehydration, starvation and sharks, including one that the men, in a jolting scene, wrestle onboard and devour. Like a lot of actors turned directors, she’s good with the performers, even when platitudes gush from their mouths along with the blood.  
“Unbroken” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). War violence and crimes. 
‽
‽Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb‽,‽“Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb” signifies closing time for the franchise in which exhibits come alive, and Ben Stiller has to deal with them. The director, Shawn Levy, and the new writers, David Guion and Michael Handelman, throw together enough gags and one-liners to ensure a diverting and, here and there, rather funny journey for the museum stalwart Larry and his menagerie of Teddy Roosevelt, a miniature Roman general, a Neanderthal, a capuchin monkey and others. 
Now director of nighttime operations, Larry (Mr. Stiller, near left) must visit a pharaoh (Ben Kingsley!) in the British Museum to learn why Roosevelt and friends went bonkers during a dinner show at the American Museum of Natural History. The problems center on an enchanted Egyptian tablet tied to the animation of the exhibits. The trip introduces new blood to the comedy, chiefly a revived Sir Lancelot (a sharp Dan Stevens, far left) and a gabby British nightwatchwoman (Rebel Wilson), and Larry’s travails with his college-averse son yield lessons about independence. 
It’s a chronically underachieving movie, but relatively amusing in its quaint wish fulfillment. 
‽
‽Annie‽,‽Quvenzhané Wallis is a born movie star, with charisma to burn and a rare ability to magnetize an audience’s attention. She showed as much in “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” filmed when she was just 6. In “Annie” she is older and taller, less pixieish and closer to the awkwardness of adolescence, but, if anything, her ability to charm has only increased. Unfortunately, it isn’t enough. 
The narrative and emotional architecture of a much loved, frequently revived, maybe-not-quite-as-great-as-you-remember-it show has been reduced to a chaotic shambles. “It’s the Hard-Knock Life” can still lodge itself in your head, and “Tomorrow” retains the power to dampen your eyes, but the way these and other numbers are arranged, choreographed and edited undermines their effectiveness. A movie musical is more than a bunch of actors lip-syncing on camera, but “Annie” is barely even that. The voices sound thin and flat. The mouths don’t move in time with the music. The dancing is a chaotic stew of flailing limbs. Numbers that are supposed to lift you out of the story into a realm of giddy wonder and pure feeling have the opposite effect. You just wish they would end. 
When the singing stops, a few slightly more amusing things happen. The high point is a movie-within-the-movie, a blissfully silly sendup of the “Twilight” franchise that provides “Annie” with its only moment of genuine inspiration. Otherwise, Mr. Foxx and Ms. Wallis seem to have a nice time together, like people making the best of a long flight by playing a few hands of gin rummy. 
In Harold Gray’s original “Little Orphan Annie” comic strip, Warbucks was also an avatar of anti-New Deal conservatism, his charity an alternative to the policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. In the recessionary 1970s, the Broadway musical (adapted for the screen by John Huston in 1982) made room for Roosevelt and ended on a note of harmony between government and private enterprise. 
I suppose a family entertainment needs to play it safe and avoid inflaming any public sensitivities. But there is a long list of movies, musical and otherwise, that are both engaging and engaged. The new “Annie” is neither. Instead of treated, we’ve been tricked. 
‽
‽The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies‽,‽“You are only quite a little fellow in a wide world, after all,” Gandalf reminds his companion at the end of “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.” The avuncular line has a cozy feel that evokes the bedtime-storytelling of J. R. R. Tolkien’s 1937 children’s classic — now better known as the trilogized prequel to a 21st-century fantasy phenomenon. Gandalf’s sentiment is also all too apt for Peter Jackson’s vexing conclusion to his oddly apportioned adaptation: Bilbo Baggins is indeed quite a little fellow in Mr. Jackson’s wide world here — less a central hero on a quest than a supporting player in a film bookended by destruction and war in gray, grim lands. 
When the Dwarfs, Elves and Orcs — those dumpy, evil forces that appear constantly to need the direction from their rabble-rousing leaders to go forth and “slay them all” — finally engage, Mr. Jackson’s massed set pieces shift between stirring visual salvos and general panoramic swarming. It’s only as individual good guys peel off for death-defying face-offs with Orcs on ledges that the routine violence crackles again with genuine danger and deft showmanship. 
‽
‽Top Five‽,‽In Chris Rock’s fast and blisteringly funny “Top Five” — a romantic comedy that’s also an extended riff on art, identity, authenticity and what it means to be a black entertainer — Mr. Rock plays Andre Allen, a comic in crisis. A stand-up star turned movie-franchise brand, Andre has climbed to the top of the box office playing Hammy, a kind of “Lethal Weapon” enforcer in a bear suit with a gun and a Schwarzenegger-style tag line: “It’s Hammy time!” (The words “600 million worldwide” are stamped on a movie trailer in blood-red letters.) Now, though, Andre is trying to get serious with “Uprize!,” a painfully misbegotten historical drama in which he plays a Haitian slave revolutionary.  
The movie opens with Andre trying to publicize “Uprize!,” which is about to hit (and flop). Shooting in New York, Mr. Rock, who wrote and directed “Top Five,” sets the scene at warp speed with a compressed career retrospective that fills in Andre’s history, his greatest hits and current aspirations. Charlie Rose, playing himself, pops by briefly and early to solidify Andre’s place in the rarified celebrity firmament. Time magazine, Mr. Rose explains, anointed Andre the funniest man in America, an honor that’s soon slyly undercut when a fan asks Andre when the next Hammy movie hits. “I don’t feel like doing funny movies anymore,” Andre says later, “I don’t feel funny.” Given how funny the movie and Andre both are, Mr. Rock makes it tough to take this lament seriously.  
Comics — they (still) don’t get no respect! In some ways, “Top Five” revisits the question of art and its uses that merrily hums through Preston Sturges’s “Sullivan’s Travels” (1941), about a director who wants his next picture to be “a true canvas of the suffering of humanity.” In “Stardust Memories” (1980), Woody Allen’s woebegone pastiche of “8 ½,” Mr. Allen plays Sandy Bates, a director troubled by a similar crisis in comedic faith. “I don’t feel funny,” Bates says. “I look around the world, and all I see is human suffering.” When Bates shows some executives his latest film, one asks, “Doesn’t the man know that he has the greatest gift that anyone can have — the gift of laughter?”  
One of the ideas that Mr. Rock teases throughout “Top Five” is whether the stakes are different when the funnyman with that gift is black. That becomes prime fodder for the interview that Andre does with Chelsea Brown (a wonderful Rosario Dawson), a reporter for The New York Times assigned to write a profile of him. Wearing a brimmed hat that she might have borrowed from Annie Hall, Chelsea is rapidly transformed from Andre’s interrogator — he berates her for asking hack questions — into his inevitable romantic foil. Initially accompanied by Andre’s entourage, including his friend and body man, Silk (JB Smoove, superb), the two break free and begin walking and talking through a New York that’s seductively romantic, partly because it’s grounded in real ideas about how we live now.  
Andre may be the main attraction, but Mr. Rock’s generosity as a filmmaker here means that Chelsea has plenty to say and do. Beat for beat, laugh for laugh, Ms. Dawson fluidly keeps pace with Mr. Rock, whether their characters are arguing about multiculturalism or revisiting Andre’s career highs and hilarious, horrible lows, one of which is recounted in a gaspingly funny, raunchy flashback with a fantastic Cedric the Entertainer. Mr. Rock’s acknowledged debt to Richard Linklater’s peripatetic “Before” triptych is evident in all the two-shots of Andre and Chelsea walking and talking, but also in how it’s a given from the start that they’re equals. Chelsea gives as good as she gets, yet never at the expense of Andre’s other love interest, Erica (Gabrielle Union), a reality-television star.  
Mr. Rock has far more on his mind than a catfight. In “Top Five,” he sifts through — with on-point jokes, boisterous slapstick, affecting honesty and a sharply honed and earned sense of history — issues of artificiality and authenticity, the spectacle of black celebrity and the imperative of personal meaning. Andre has become famous by playing Hammy the Bear, a character that completely obscures his blackness and his maleness. Both Hammy and the Haitian revolutionary represent two familiar — and Mr. Rock seems to suggest — permitted modes of black expression: clowning and suffering. In setting Andre on his search for self, Mr. Rock has carved out a third way, in the process creating a black character who’s fully human and a comedy that’s wholly a blast.

‽The Captive‽,‽Almost everything in “The Captive” looks pale and exhausted, not just the flat interiors and the wan women at its center. Even the film’s villain — a grinning, Mozart-loving skeeve who, when a young girl goes missing, should be the prime suspect on appearance alone — moves as if his aberrant behavior were more trouble than it’s worth. 
“The Captive” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Not a single unsavory moment, unless you count the bad guy’s opera singing.

‽Skating to New York‽,‽In “Skating to New York,” four Canadian high school friends and a kid brother spend one of the coldest days of the year trying to skate roughly 25 miles across Lake Ontario, frozen over for the first time in decades. Hoping to become local legends, they meet ice fishermen and smugglers, battle the elements and hypothermia. But it’s what they’re leaving behind — and what they’ll return to — that’s the real story. 
“Skating to New York” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), for hockey violence and tart language. Those Canadians. 
‽
‽Expelled‽,‽Demographically, the high school caper “Expelled” has some curiosity value because it features Cameron Dallas, who has over six million followers on Vine, the video-sharing service. But comedically, this film about a prankster who is finally thrown out of school does not represent the debut of a great talent, whether in front of or behind the camera. 
“Expelled” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some crude language. 
‽
‽The Pyramid‽,‽In “The Pyramid,” an archaeological team and a documentary crew get stuck in an ancient Egyptian tomb that is armed with booby traps and protected by feral, inbred cats. Clearly, this is not a situation to which logic applies. The movie nevertheless adds a veneer of realism, setting the action during the unrest of August 2013.  
A father-daughter archaeologist pair, Miles (Denis O’Hare) and Nora (Ashley Hinshaw), share exposition duties, reading the hieroglyphics to understand what might be down there. (Miles pleads with everyone not to use the word “curse.”) The answers aren’t satisfying, and “The Pyramid,” despite an unpretentious matinee vibe, is mostly interesting in seeing how little light can be on screen before a bare minimum of suspense and coherence dissipates. There is, truly, not much to see in this movie. 
‽
‽The Foxy Merkins‽,‽Margaret (Lisa Haas), the heroine of Madeleine Olnek’s sly, loose-jointed satire “The Foxy Merkins,” is probably no one’s idea of a lesbian prostitute, or a midnight cowgirl. Brand-new to New York, the stocky, bespectacled Margaret camps out in a restroom in the Port Authority Bus Terminal, where she sleeps, wrapped in clear plastic. But as she wanders the city, she is avidly cruised by closeted suburban women who ogle from their car windows and do double takes when they pass her on the sidewalk.

‽Take Care‽,‽“You get dramatic sometimes,” Devon says to his ex-girlfriend Frannie, in the mildly amusing rom-com “Take Care.” 
‽
‽Among the Believers‽,‽“Once we train their minds, they’ll never change until they die,” the dean of the Red Mosque madrasa says casually and, for the viewer, chillingly, in “Among the Believers.” 
The film, directed by Hemal Trivedi and Mohammed Ali Naqvi, revolves around interviews with Abdul Aziz, a cleric and leader of the Red Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, which indoctrinates thousands of students at its Islamic schools. Mr. Aziz is not shy when discussing his goal of imposing Shariah law on the country. Though the mosque has sometimes been subjected to government crackdowns (including a violent siege in 2007), those only strengthen Mr. Aziz’s conviction. 
The directors let their subjects speak without overtly passing judgment. And while it is maddening to see the aversion to open-minded education by Mr. Aziz (“‘Progressive thought’ is dying,” he declares, pleased), we also see the stark poverty that leaves others with few choices but to follow him. 
‽
‽Olympic Pride, American Prejudice‽,‽The Olympic Games have never been immune from politics, and they certainly weren’t in 1936, when Berlin was the host city and Hitler sought to present the Third Reich in a flattering light. That the United States thwarted him is largely because of the black athletes who receive their due in Deborah Riley Draper’s deft and comprehensive documentary “Olympic Pride, American Prejudice.” As the movie makes clear, racial politics played a major role, both domestically and abroad. 
The villain here is Avery Brundage, the United States Olympic Association president, who trusted the Nazis’ vow to include a Jew on their team (they later reneged) and who dropped the American team’s two Jewish members before a track event Hitler attended. 
‽
‽A Space Program‽,‽“The Martian,” Ridley Scott’s big-budget Hollywood adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel, gave a sense of how a state-of-the-art mission to the red planet might look. Now “A Space Program” offers a decidedly low-tech alternative. 
The installation itself paid homage to 20th-century engineering and applied science. From NASA identity cards to excursion module to land vehicle, the Mars project created the components for Mission Control and each phase of the journey out of steel and plywood and found objects. Spacesuits, for example, were made from the Tyvek of many an overnight mailing envelope. “Our space program is handmade,” Mr. Sachs explains, “guided by the philosophy of bricolage.” 
Whatever else the film carries, it packs some serious whimsy. The Mars landing is handled by an astronaut successfully completing an ancient Atari video game; planetary explorations to gather and dispatch samples feature a handsaw and bottle rockets. Displaying primitive ingenuity, the movie recalls Georges Méliès and the early days of cinema. And as a tribute to NASA, “A Space Program” is rich in the core elements that have always propelled humanity’s flights of fancy: imagination and the right tools. 
‽
‽Other People's Children‽,‽“Other People’s Children,” a painfully hackneyed first feature by the director Liz Hinlein, is doomed from the outset by its wearisome heroine, Sam (Diane Marshall-Green). Appearing in almost every scene, Sam — a filmmaker who has “victim” practically stenciled on her forehead — drifts vapidly through downtown Los Angeles, trying to untangle her feelings about her recently deceased father by engaging in mindless sex and binge drinking. 
‽
‽Point Break‽,‽ 
Ms. Bigelow’s California-focused original is about an agent named Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) who infiltrates a surfer crime ring run by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Here, the Australian actor Luke Bracey plays Johnny, and Bodhi (an uncompelling Édgar Ramírez) leads an enlightened gang of extreme-sports enthusiasts instead of a crime ring. 
Make sense? No? That’s fine, really, because the less you try to parse the group’s rationale, the better. The appeal of this “Point Break” is its high drama (the stunts), and definitely not its dramatic filler: Johnny getting flak from his F.B.I. handler (Ray Winstone), or Bodhi and his lone female comrade (Teresa Palmer) intoning slogans that could be ads for organic cereal (“Read the flow”). 
It’s the globe-trotting feats that make the grade. These set pieces feel a bit more like appreciations of extreme sports than action-movie sequences, but the climax — a wingsuited flight down an Alpine canyon wall partly shot with body cameras — puts to shame your average frictionless superhero aerial acrobatics (even if Johnny and friends look like flying squirrels in sleeping bags while doing it). 
‽
‽The Hateful Eight‽,‽Quentin Tarantino is a scholar of old movies with a particular antiquarian fetish for the ways they used to be made and consumed. His eighth feature, “The Hateful Eight,” was shot on film with antique lenses and is being projected at some theaters in sumptuous, wide-screen 70-millimeter Panavision. 
Though “Hateful Eight” takes place in a hermetic and familiar cinematic universe, it also, like “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained” before it, has more than just the history of cinema on its mind. It shares with those movies an impulse to imagine how the fantasy world of film genres might intersect with the cruelty of real-world history and offer a kind of belated symbolic redress. The winking and filibustering are undertaken with the serious intent of collecting make-believe payback for actual wrongs. This is an ethically tricky, artistically risky undertaking, but in Mr. Tarantino’s hands, it is never not interesting. 
Mr. Tarantino rewrites this tradition by casting Mr. Jackson as Marquis Warren, who wears a blue United States Army major’s uniform and carries with him a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Currently employed, like so many Tarantino heroes, as a bounty hunter, Marquis is well aware that neither his service record nor his connection to the martyred president will secure his dignity or protect him from bigotry. Before long, racial epithets and threats of harm are coming his way from all directions. 
In Mr. Tarantino’s world, hostility and camaraderie are close neighbors. Marquis encounters the friendly, grizzled face of John Ruth (Mr. Russell), a colleague in the business of pursuing miscreants. They have different approaches to the job, in particular the “dead or alive” part. Marquis prefers the first option, but John, known as the Hangman, believes in delivering his quarry to the proper authorities more or less intact. And so he is in the company of a live prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who takes an instant dislike to Marquis. 
Unfortunately, it knows just what to do with Ms. Leigh’s Daisy, who enters the film with a black eye and exits it — well, I guess I’d better not reveal much more. Suffice it to say that she is the film’s scapegoat and punching bag and, above all, its excuse for its own imaginative failures. At a certain point, the n-word gives way to the b-word as the dominant hateful epithet, and “The Hateful Eight” mutates from an exploration of racial animus into an orgy of elaborately justified misogyny. The final scenes wrap up this shaggy-dog story with a nasty punch line, delivering on the promise of the film’s title. I won’t spoil it. See for yourself. 
‽
‽TransFatty Lives‽,‽Some films, blogs and other chronicles that document the course of a fatal disease adopt a purpose or point of view — the dying subject wants to raise awareness, convey a spiritual insight, teach others how to cope with the same illness, or whatever. Patrick Sean O’Brien’s “TransFatty Lives,” in which he records his own deterioration from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, seems determined not to be pigeonholed in that fashion. That makes it refreshingly unpredictable but also frustrating. 
‽
‽Joy‽,‽On paper, David O. Russell’s new film, “Joy,” looks perfectly straightforward, even square. It’s a bootstrap-capitalist fable, a tale of adversity overcome and rags exchanged for riches, a case study in success suitable for a self-improvement seminar. 
Like Micky Ward, the striving pug played by Mark Wahlberg in that movie, Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself thwarted and undermined by her own family. In the film’s opening scenes, her various relations nearly erase her altogether, blocking Ms. Lawrence’s quiet incandescence with ugliness and noise. The divorced mother of two young children, Joy left college when her parents split up and now contends daily with a small army of needy narcissists. Her mother, Terry (Virginia Madsen), lies in bed all day watching a soap opera (a fake one that Mr. Russell has cast with real-life soap opera stars). Rudy (Robert De Niro), Terry’s ex-husband, acts like a helpless child when he’s single and like an entitled patriarch when there’s a woman in his life. Joy also has a passive-aggressive sister (Elisabeth Rohm) and an ex-husband of her own, who is living in her basement until his singing career takes off. 
All of this information is conveyed in Mr. Russell’s breathless, breakneck style. The camera never stops moving, the people never shut up, and the resulting buzz is both stimulating and enervating. There are a few bright spots and calm moments in Joy’s drab, frenetic life. Her grandmother, Mimi (Diane Ladd), believes in her (and provides benevolent voice-over narration). Joy’s ex, Tony (Édgar Ramírez), is actually a pretty nice guy and is able, like Amy Adams’s character in “The Fighter,” to be an ally against the familial back stabbers. 
It’s not so easy, of course. And if “Joy” seems to move toward a foreordained conclusion, it zigzags and covers its tracks along the way, sending its heroine on a roller-coaster ride of raised hopes and brutal disappointments and playing tricks with the audience’s expectations. What kind of spark will ignite between Joy and Neil Walker, a big shot in the world of home-shopping cable television? Since he’s played by Bradley Cooper, the answer could be anything. 
And Mr. Russell gives this meat-and-potatoes parable of upward mobility, set in the early 1990s, a children’s-book quality. I don’t mean that the story is simplified, but rather that its magical, improbable and cruel elements are heavily underlined, so that Joy feels more like a princess laboring under a terrible spell than like a struggling working-class mother. The trolls, witches and ogres she must beguile and vanquish are, for the most part, her own kin. She is, like a fairy-tale hero or heroine, on a long and complicated quest, relying on spells and charms as well as her innate goodness to deliver her. 
It can be argued that Ms. Lawrence is miscast, that she’s too young, too glamorous, insufficiently dented by life’s hard knocks. It can also be argued: So what? Joy’s Cinderella qualities suit her perfectly, and she has the rare ability to combine radiance with realism. Like some of the great screen goddesses of old — for some reason, Lauren Bacall seems like the best point of comparison — she seems at once impossibly magnetic and completely down to earth, regal and democratic, ordinary and perfect. 
‽
‽Concussion‽,‽The sickening crunch of football players crashing against each other, helmet to helmet, echoes through “Concussion” like an alarm. There’s another appalling sound here, too, created by the collision of corporate avarice — in the blurred form of the National Football League — and a doctor fighting a righteous fight. 
What Dr. Omalu discovered were splotches called tau proteins and a progressive degenerative brain disease. (Misshapen tau proteins are also associated with Alzheimer’s disease.) As Jeanne Marie Laskas explains in a sympathetic, no-nonsense 2009 GQ profile of Dr. Omalu, a buildup of tau proteins had done a horrific number on Mr. Webster’s brain. “Tau was kind of like sludge, clogging up the works, killing cells in regions responsible for mood, emotions” and executive functioning, as Ms. Laskas puts it. “This is why Mike Webster was crazy.” Dr. Omalu diagnosed Mr. Webster with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., three letters that have — through scientific studies, news reports and lawsuits — become inextricably connected with three others: N.F.L. 
“Concussion” charts the diagnosis Dr. Omalu made and the ensuing fight both to force the N.F.L. to publicly acknowledge the truth of his findings and to do something to prevent C.T.E. It also gives Dr. Omalu a blandly tasteful Hollywood makeover. Working from Ms. Laskas’s magazine profile, the writer-director Peter Landesman takes the doctor’s discovery and turns it into a hero’s journey with Bennet forced to trudge past some awfully familiar professional and personal signposts. While some of these milestone moments add detail and shading — namely any scene involving Albert Brooks, who periodically drops by to goose the movie to life as Bennet’s boss — others are too off-the-shelf generic to be of use, including those with Bennet’s eventual wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). 
‽
‽Daddy's Home‽,‽“Daddy’s Home” is an ugly psychological cockfight posing as a family-friendly comedy. Laugh-free — except for some farcical, life-threatening stunts at the expense of Will Ferrell’s character, Brad — it is best avoided unless a movie that has the attitude and mind-set of a schoolyard bully happens to be your thing. 
The movie, directed by Sean Anders (“Horrible Bosses 2”), from a screenplay he wrote with Brian Burns and John Morris, is a cruel, muscle-flexing fantasy of domination and emasculation. Early on, it is revealed that Brad has been infertile since an accident (shown in flashback) involving an X-ray machine in a dentist’s office. Dusty slyly informs him that Sarah would like to have another child, and persuades Brad to see an endocrinologist (Bobby Cannavale), who crudely compares the two dads’ private parts. 
Dusty initiates a competition with Brad in which he wins every round, all the while refusing to acknowledge that they are competing. He wows the kids by building a treehouse with an attached skateboarding ramp, which he navigates like a pro. He bribes them with cash and introduces them to sports heroes. Brad remains unflappably good-natured until he can’t take it anymore and has an excruciating public meltdown. 
‽
‽Mr. Six‽,‽Mr. Six is a grumpy old fixture on his Beijing back street, ready to scold or shoot a withering look. But as we are frequently reminded in the director Guan Hu’s character study “Mr. Six,” he was one bad dude back in the day. That was before the money-obsessed modern age in China gave rise to spoiled rich kids, fancy modified cars and a general lack of decency. All these problems bedevil Mr. Six, whose estranged son is held captive by a wealthy, speed-racing brat named Kris. 
 
‽
‽45 Years‽,‽Film is an art that plays tricks with time. A movie is a fixed, finite, relatively short experience — a hundred minutes or so in a given viewer’s life — that can span years, even centuries. The phrase “real time,” sometimes applied to movies that match their internal and external chronologies, expresses a wish and a delusion. In reality, as on screen, time compresses, expands, doubles back on itself and even, now and then, appears to stop. 
Mr. Haigh, who at 42 is a few years shy of his movie’s title, shades his picture of the Mercers with subtle nostalgia. Like the couple played by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen in Mike Leigh’s “Another Year,” Geoff and Kate are serene survivors of Britain’s postwar transformation, beneficiaries of the collapse of old hierarchies and the expansion of opportunity. Ms. Rampling, 69, and Mr. Courtenay, 78, are themselves both avatars of the ’60s, though her star rose a bit later than his. In “Billy Liar” and “The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner” he established himself as one of the era’s great rebels, a wiry, jumpy young man pushing upward and outward against the constraints of class and circumstance. 
It isn’t hard to supply adventurous pasts for Geoff and Kate, who reminisce fondly about the early days of their relationship. But the past intrudes on them in an unexpected and unnerving way. As they are arranging a big anniversary party, a letter arrives from Switzerland. The body of Katya, a former girlfriend of Geoff’s who died in a mountaineering accident while they were traveling together, has been recovered from a glacier, and the authorities believe Geoff is the next of kin. 
In his previous feature, the wondrous “Weekend,” Mr. Haigh showed how a brief sexual encounter between two young men could contain a lifetime’s worth of feeling. After 48 hours together, the lovers had somehow arrived at a complete and perfect knowledge of one another. “45 years” points its inquiry into the ways of love in the opposite direction, and suggests that even after decades together, two people can remain perfect strangers. 
‽
‽He Never Died‽,‽Performances don’t come more deadpan than the one Henry Rollins gives in “He Never Died,” an enjoyably strange horror film directed by Jason Krawczyk. Though perhaps “deadpan” is a poor choice of words, given that Mr. Rollins’s character, Jack, seems unable to die. 
“He Never Died” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for gore and strong language. 
‽
‽Noma My Perfect Storm‽,‽In the combat sport of haute cuisine, few recent careers have intrigued as much as that of René Redzepi, the head chef of Noma, in Copenhagen, which has topped a list of the world’s best restaurants four of the last six years. Mr. Redzepi co-founded Noma first on the principle of resurrecting Nordic cuisine, and then on the idea of “time and place” — intricately preparing dishes using only local and seasonally appropriate ingredients. 
‽
‽Son of Saul‽,‽The shape of the screen is unusually narrow in “Son of Saul,” the 38-year-old Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes’s debut feature. Nearly square, it evokes an earlier era, when all movies looked this way, and also emphasizes the claustrophobia of the story and the setting. We are in a Nazi death camp, and really in it, to a degree that few fictional films have had the nerve to attempt. The camera doesn’t just survey the barracks and the guard towers, the haggard prisoners and brutal guards. It takes us to the very door of the gas chambers, in the close company of Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig), a Jewish inmate who is a member of the camp’s Sonderkommando (special commando) unit. 
This larger history is kept outside the frame. Shot mostly in extended close-ups (the skilled director of photography is Matyas Erdely), “Son of Saul” moves rapidly and relentlessly in the present tense, never leaving Saul’s side. Not that we penetrate his thoughts. Mr. Rohrig, a poet and former teacher appearing in his first film, has the intriguing opacity that distinguishes nonprofessional actors. Like Lamberto Maggiorani in “Bicycle Thieves” or Maria Falconetti in “The Passion of Joan of Arc,” he is an indelibly particular, almost spiritually intense, screen presence. His face is hard to read and impossible to forget — a mask of stoicism, anguish, exhaustion and cunning. 
Our eyes are trained on Saul, and therefore we don’t see much of what he sees. Mr. Nemes uses shallow focus techniques that blur everything not immediately in front of his protagonist’s face. Though we find ourselves in close proximity to death, we are also detached from it. Human figures are blurred, movements are indistinct, and horrifying sounds — cries, gasps, footsteps, blows — reach us from invisible sources. 
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the mass murder of the Jews seemed to many artists and intellectuals to exist beyond the reach of representation. It was something to be handled with the utmost care and gravity. But art, especially popular art, abhors a vacuum, and the Shoah is, among other things, a rich reservoir of stories, true and speculative. There are works of narrative — like Claude Lanzmann’s “Shoah” or the novels of Patrick Modiano — that try to measure the gulf between past and present and to document the inadequacy of memory. There are others that try to bridge that gap by recreating or retrieving a sense of what actually happened. “Schindler’s List” remains the best-known — and one of the best examples. And there are some that try to fill the void with fable and fantasy, like “Inglourious Basterds” and “Life Is Beautiful.” 
‽
‽Bajirao Mastani‽,‽At the beginning of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s “Bajirao Mastani,” a Bollywood romance set in 18th-century India, there’s much talk of planting saffron (that is, Hindu) flags in Delhi, the heart of the Mughal (that is, Muslim) empire. Is this going to be an unpleasant India-for-Hindus epic? On the other hand, the movie seems to have some feminist bona fides: Mastani (Deepika Padukone) is an impressively fierce woman warrior, who saves the life of the equally fierce Bajirao (Ranveer Singh) on the battlefield as arrows whiz by her head. “Mastani writes her own destiny,” she says. Well, O.K. 
‽
‽Sisters‽,‽“Sisters” is a movie to go out and see when you’ve run out of television to watch. Which could happen, at least theoretically. Directed by Jason Moore (“Pitch Perfect”) from a script by the longtime “Saturday Night Live” writer Paula Pell, this raunchy-huggy comedy features, in keeping with Hollywood custom, a gaggle of well-known and well-liked sitcom and sketch-comedy performers being a little less funny than you want them to be. They are allowed to swear more robustly than on network or basic-cable shows, to deliver sentimental speeches along with punch lines and to play with or against type as the mood suits. 
Tina Fey, as Kate Ellis, falls — or rather leaps — into the “against” category. We’re used to seeing Ms. Fey (especially but not only on “30 Rock”) as an anxious overthinker using her caustic sarcasm as a weapon against both her own insecurities and the flakes and train wrecks who surround her. This time, she gets to be the train wreck. Kate is sometimes scolded for her irresponsibility by her teenage daughter, Haley (Madison Davenport), but her real foil is her younger sister, Maura, played in full goody-two-shoes splendor by Amy Poehler. Way back in 2008, in “Baby Mama,” Ms. Poehler was the wayward yin to Ms. Fey’s uptight yang. This time, the polarities are reversed, but the performers are too restless, and too much in sync, to settle into a simple pattern. 
When they were growing up — as attested to in passages from diaries they find in their old bedroom — Kate was hedonistic and adventurous, while Maura was prudent and prudish. In their 40s, they find themselves stuck in these roles. Kate is a hothead who can’t hold down a job. Maura, a nurse, is divorced and lonely. 
To add to their woes, Kate and Maura’s parents (James Brolin and Dianne Wiest) have decided to sell the family home in Orlando, Fla., and move into a condominium complex where they have less space and more sex. Their easygoing retirement bliss is a rebuke to their daughters’ midlife misery. Kate and Maura don’t seem to know how to be happy, except when they are together in the childhood home they are about to lose. 
The party movie is a venerable genre. So is the movie-as-party, which is a slightly different creature. “Sisters” is a hybrid of the two, and also, therefore, a fairly standard specimen of modern post-“Hangover” commercial film comedy. It falls into the same category as “Neighbors” or “The Night Before,” which is to say it’s uneven, generally enjoyable, self-consciously naughty and also, despite drug use and jokes about anal sex, more concerned with reassurance than transgression. 
Since Maura has a crush on a hunky neighbor (Ike Barinholtz, playing a handsome dullard rather than the goofball you might know from “The Mindy Project”), she is allowed to cut loose and go crazy. Kate reluctantly agrees to be the sober “party mom.” At first the guests glumly act their age, but then the tequila starts to flow, the music becomes loud, the joints are lit and the requisite funny stuff starts to happen. The respectable wife and mother (Samantha Bee) takes her top off. The jokey fat guy (Bobby Moynihan) loses his pants. The sad, weird woman (Rachel Dratch) gets drunker and weirder and sadder. The mean girl (Maya Rudolph) tries to crash the party, and then to sabotage it. The audience learns which groups Hollywood is still willing to treat as comic stereotypes, with the usual escape clause that the stereotypes themselves are being held up for mockery. It turns out to be Asian women and lesbians. 
But nobody really gets hurt (except for maybe Mr. Barinholtz’s character, who has an uncomfortable encounter with a ballerina music box), and nobody stays mad. Unlike small-screen sitcom characters, who can change slowly over seasons or not at all, the protagonists of movie comedies must grow, learn, change and forgive. This is almost always a drag, even when it’s kind of touching, as it is here.

‽Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip‽,‽Now would be an excellent time for parents of young children to invest in earplugs. A new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie has landed. This one’s called “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,” the fourth in the series, which began in 2007 and mixes live-action and computer-generated characters. 
“Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for rude humor and language. 
‽
‽Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back‽,‽“I think he’s one of the greatest artists that we have today — but he could also be the worst,” a collector says in “Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back.” It’s one of several bits of hyperbole in a documentary that works best when it stops overanalyzing its subject and instead focuses on his mischievous art. 
Still, the art is the star and Ms. Axelrod features plenty of it. She also outlines a knowing path through Mr. Cattelan’s career, leaving just enough room to have you wondering if the artist is more of a con man than a genius. On that, make your own decision. No expert is needed. 
‽
‽In Search of Israeli Cuisine‽,‽“In Search of Israeli Cuisine” starts out seeming as if it might be indistinguishable from any of the countless globe-hopping foodie shows on television. As it goes along, though, this documentary by Roger Sherman at least touches on issues like culinary appropriation and national identity as defined through food. When it’s not being overly promotional, it can be interesting. 
It’s too bad the film doesn’t have more of this feisty interplay — long stretches are just the usual food-speak about local ingredients and childhoods spent watching Grandma cook. Its best segments, though, are an informative take on a subject that is still very much evolving. 
‽
‽Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America‽,‽The African-American musician Daryl Davis, a journeyman who has played backup for Chuck Berry, has an unusual hobby. He cultivates cordial relationships with prominent racists — Ku Klux Klan leaders, front men for neo-Nazi groups and so on — and through a form of friendly persuasion, tries to steer them from their bigotry. 
This movie arrives two weeks after Carl Paladino, a white political operative and ally of President-elect Donald J. Trump, equated the first lady, Michelle Obama, to a gorilla, then said in a follow-up interview that his remarks were “not racist.” 
‽
‽Paterson‽,‽Poems slip across the screen like water in “Paterson,” Jim Jarmusch’s wonderful new dispatch from Jarmusch-land. Sometimes they appear over water, too, surfacing word by word on images of the Great Falls along the Passaic River in Paterson, N.J. No pen or pencil directly spells out these words, no clattering keyboard or banging typewriter. Instead, the words — in a neat, cramped hand — appear onscreen as they are read aloud by their author, Paterson (Adam Driver), a soulful bus driver and basement poet. It’s as if he were beaming his heart-song straight from his head into yours. 
It’s a quiet life, its rhythms determined by labor and the old Monday through Friday routine. Like most people’s workweeks, his story opens on a Monday, that word stamped on the screen. Dividing stories into units of time, into hours and days, is a familiar structuring device, sometimes used for suspense or to create a countdown. Stanley Kubrick inserted days on title cards in “The Shining,” jumping from “Tuesday” to “Thursday,” a gap that suggests that something is amiss with time itself and that amps the unease. In “Paterson,” by contrast, the march of days announces both the regimentation of Paterson’s punch-clock obligations and the story’s structure, its pattern. 
Patterns — including yards of circles, dancing squiggles and twinned images — fill “Paterson,” creating a vibrant visual punctuation to the otherwise relaxed storytelling. Mr. Jarmusch likes to take it nice and easy, and this movie is fairly low-key, even by his fairly chill standards. Paterson’s work demands consistency, routine, punctuation and safety (no speedy action-flick escapades here), which create a kind of meditative flow. Passengers come and go, embarking and disembarking and talking or kidding about this and that. Paterson cocks an ear to listen to this human babble, bobbing in and out of its stream before heading over to the city’s magnificent Great Falls to eat lunch. 
Williams lived and practiced medicine near Paterson, and borrowed its name for his multipart epic poem, which, he wrote, involves “the resemblance between the mind of modern man and a city.” He opens the first of its volumes by declaring, “Rigor of beauty is the quest,” only to ask, “But how will you find beauty when it is locked in the mind past all remonstrance?” 
Williams suggests that the answer is “to make a start, out of particulars and make them general,” adding that all we know is our “own complexities.” As Paterson writes, Mr. Jarmusch sometimes fills the screen with particulars — Laura’s face, the crashing falls — superimposing them as if to suggest ideas swirling into words, patterns and poetry. 
‽
‽Toni Erdmann‽,‽Early in “Toni Erdmann” — by a wide margin the funniest almost-three-hour German comedy you will ever see — there is a brief discussion, conducted in a sterile modern office building in Bucharest, about the meaning of the English word “performance.” For Anca (Ingrid Bisu), a young Romanian employed by a global consulting firm, it refers to the way she does her job and, more than that, her ability to obey the norms and protocols of the corporate workplace. Her boss, she explains, gives her “a lot of feedback,” which is clearly a euphemism. 
It is, most simply but also most elusively, a sweet and thorny tale of father-daughter bonding with a finely honed edge of generational conflict, propelled by two extraordinarily natural, utterly fearless performances. Winfried, a shaggy baby boomer, has had the luxury of conflating irresponsibility with idealism. Amicably divorced from Ines’s mother, devoted to his own mother and his aging dog, he has settled into a permanent, pleasant state of not-quite-adulthood, in which he reserves the right not to take anything too seriously.

‽Dangal‽,‽Let it never be said that if you’ve seen one inspirational sports movie, you’ve seen them all. 
Based on the true story of Geeta and Babita Phogat (played as children by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar and as adults by Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra), who eventually competed in the Olympics, and their trainer-father, Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan), the movie benefits from the amount of time it devotes to wrestling strategy. It pays off in suspenseful bouts that haven’t been hyperedited into incoherence, with actresses who really appear to be grappling. 
‽
‽Why Him?‽,‽From the moment we spy the dead-moose art installation that graces the home of Laird (James Franco) in “Why Him?,” we suspect that the glass tank of urine in which it floats will at some point crack and douse one or more characters. It’s no fun at all being right. 
The standoff between the two men, then, is a rich vein that the filmmakers mine for no more than cheap, excruciatingly belabored gags. None more so than a homage to the “Pink Panther” movies, a sequence that the filmmakers smother so thoroughly in explanation that even the marvelous Keegan-Michael Key is unable to bring about resuscitation. 
‽
‽Julieta‽,‽According to a poem by Elizabeth Bishop, “the art of losing isn’t hard to master.” But making a masterwork on the subject of loss, a perennial theme in art, may be harder than it looks. The young adulthood and middle age of Julieta, the heroine of Pedro Almodóvar’s new movie, are shadowed by death and abandonment, which she does her best to handle gracefully. Mr. Almodóvar, for his part, tells her story with his characteristic later-period blend of elegant restraint and keening melodrama. “Julieta” is scrupulous, compassionate and surprising, even if it does not always quite communicate the full gravity and sweep of the feelings it engages. 
The colors are important because they are part of Mr. Almodóvar’s emotional vocabulary. In his films, clothes, wallpaper and furniture are never mere details of production design; they are integral to the world he imagines, a rendering of contemporary Spain filtered through selected works of literature and Hollywood films of the 1950s and accompanied, more often than not, by the lustrous ache of Alberto Iglesias’s music. 
Here, as before, the cinematic reference point is Douglas Sirk, whose finely wrought, visually lush weepies have long figured among Mr. Almodóvar’s key inspirations. Julieta’s experiences — love, marriage, motherhood, small-town life — are drawn from a trilogy of linked short stories by the Canadian writer (and Nobel laureate) Alice Munro. At first, this may seem an odd match of author and filmmaker. Ms. Munro’s northern world is a place of drab, wintry tones and buttoned-up emotions, a far cry from Mr. Almodóvar’s empire of passions. 
“Julieta” has all of that, and arranges its plot not only in a straight chronological line but also according to a pattern that is at once loose and intricate. Young Julieta, a student of classics on her way to a teaching job, falls for a fisherman named Xoan (Daniel Grao) and goes to live with him in a small coastal town. They raise a daughter, Antia, amid ocean breezes and under the watchful eye of a busybody (the Almodóvar fixture Rossy de Palma). Julieta befriends Ava (Inma Cuesta), a former lover of Xoan’s, and Ava’s sculptures become part of the film’s cabinet of talismans and symbols. 
Ms. Suárez suffers with a dignity reminiscent of Bette Davis and other great screen heroines of the past, even as she surrenders to a longing that borders on mania. In a letter to her absent daughter, she likens maternal love to an addiction, and the second half of her story follows the familiar, agonizing stages of recovery, relapse and at least partial or potential redemption. 
‽
‽Passengers‽,‽There is a blazing light at the center of the interplanetary romance “Passengers,” and its name is Jennifer Lawrence. In a love story whose attempt to be an interstellar “Titanic” eventually falls flat, Ms. Lawrence’s character, Aurora, is an ambitious journalist aboard the Avalon, a commercial spacecraft making a historic 120-year voyage. Its destination is Homestead II, a pioneer colony of an overcrowded Earth. The spunky, whip-smart Aurora, who bought a round-trip ticket, hopes to write the first book about Homestead II upon her return to New York. 
At its most gripping, “Passengers,” directed by Morten Tyldum (“The Imitation Game”) from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts (a collaborator on the scripts for “The Darkest Hour,” “Prometheus” and “Doctor Strange”), conveys the panic and despair of finding yourself trapped in a luxurious corporate prison in the middle of nowhere. Solitary confinement, even amid opulence, is solitary torture. 
Their idyll abruptly ends when Arthur spills the beans to Aurora about Jim’s role in her awakening, and she explodes in a stunning fit of fury that is the movie’s dramatic high point. 
Before its midpoint, the film begins its retreat from the moral questions raised by Jim’s selfishly dragging Aurora into his personal hell. He may be handsome and charming and mechanically adept, but he’s rather dull and inarticulate with no defined personality. 
‽
‽Sing‽,‽The things you can do with computer animation these days are just more and more amazing. In “Sing,” a funny animal jukebox musical cartoon written and directed by Garth Jennings (“Son of Rambow”), there is a scene in which two postpunk porcupines, one of whom has been selected to compete in a vocal competition, argue at home about the state of their relationship, and their musical direction. During their quarrel I thought, with absolute earnestness, “Wow, these porcupines have an unusually spacious apartment.” 
A failing theatrical entrepreneur, Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey), a koala of some winsomeness and no small enthusiasm, decides to revive his fortunes with a singing competition. From a slew of auditioners (his secretary, an iguana with one glass eye, has advertised the award money as $100,000 rather than the single grand he actually has) he picks a motley handful. Among them: Johnny (Taron Egerton), a gorilla from a British-accented bank-robbing clan, who sings like Sam Smith when he’s not singing like Elton John; Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), a stressed housewife pig; a crooning, fedora-sporting, smart-mouthed mouse named Mike (Seth MacFarlane, duh); and a shy elephant, Meena (Tori Kelly), who sings Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” to herself when nobody’s listening. 
“Sing” is relentlessly amiable, and has little in the way of vulgar humor. There’s just one flatulence joke, which has to be some kind of record for a contemporary non-Pixar kid-friendly animated movie. (The film is produced by Illumination, the corporation behind “Despicable Me” and its spinoff, “Minions.”) 
‽
‽Fences‽,‽By the end of “Fences,” we will have learned a lot about Troy Maxson — about his hard Southern childhood, his time in prison and the Negro Leagues, his work ethic, his sexual appetites and his parenting philosophy — but the first and most important thing we know about the man is that he is one of the world’s great talkers. He enters the screen on a tide of verbiage, jawing with his friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and bantering with his wife, Rose (Viola Davis). The audience quickly grasps what Rose and Bono have known for years. Troy is by turns funny, provocative, inspiring and hurtful, but one thing he will never be as long as he draws breath is silent. 
Language is also, in another sense, Troy’s very substance. He came into being as words on the page, words assembled and given life by the playwright August Wilson. Embodied onstage first by James Earl Jones in the original 1985 production of “Fences” and more recently by Denzel Washington in the 2010 Broadway revival, Troy is one of the indelible characters in American dramatic literature, equal to — and in some ways a pointed response to — Arthur Miller’s Willy Loman. 
Mr. Washington, reprising the role in this fine film adaptation, which he also directed, is a pretty good talker in his own right. His voice is a mighty instrument, and if you closed your eyes and just listened to “Fences” you would hear a verbal performance of unmatched force and nuance. More than one, in fact. Ms. Davis, who also starred in that 2010 revival, has fewer lines, but as the story of their marriage unfolds, the center of gravity shifts quietly and inexorably in her direction. Rose’s plain-spokenness is the necessary counterweight to her husband’s grandiloquence. 
But even as it properly foregrounds Wilson’s dialogue — few playwrights have approached his genius for turning workaday vernacular into poetry — “Fences” is much more than a filmed reading. Mr. Washington has wisely resisted the temptation to force a lot of unnecessary cinema on the play. The action ventures beyond Troy and Rose’s yard — into their house and onto the street, mostly — to give them a bit more room to move and the audience a little more to look at. Confinement, however, is a theme implied in the play’s title, and opening it up too much would risk diluting the power of watching large personalities colliding in a narrow place. 
It’s 1957, though, and time has betrayed him. When in 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color line, it was too late for Troy, and his bitterness infects his relationship with Cory, who is being scouted for college football scholarships. Troy’s other son, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), is a musician, and the dynamic among the three of them is one of the ways “Fences” echoes “Death of a Salesman.” Troy’s betrayal of Rose is another. 
To say that the difference between Willy and Troy is racial is to state the obvious and also to risk understating Wilson’s achievement. “Fences” is part of a cycle of 10 plays about the African-American experience that amounts to a critique of the American dream from the standpoint of people intent on defying their exclusion from it. If Willy Loman’s tragedy proceeds from disillusionment, Troy’s redemption is possible because he never had any illusions to begin with. His rigid ideas about work, responsibility and manhood constitute not a demand for attention, but an assertion of dignity. His cruelty, selfishness and shortsightedness are somehow inseparable from his loyalty, his steadfastness and his existential courage. 
‽
‽Neruda‽,‽“Neruda,” Pablo Larraín’s semifantastical biopic, is a warmhearted film about a hot-blooded man that is nonetheless troubled by a subtle, perceptible chill. Blending fact with invention, it tells the story of a confrontation between an artist (the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda) and an emerging dictatorship, and more generally illuminates the endless struggle between political authority and the creative imagination. For anyone who believes that poetry and democracy spring from the same source and provoke the same enemies, this movie provides both encouragement and warning. 
Neruda also composes “Canto General,” his great, Whitmanesque work on the glories and miseries of Latin America. Pages are distributed clandestinely, and committed to memory by workers and peasants. Their popularity, and Neruda’s easygoing populism, are a rebuke to the arrogance of the ruling class and the Chilean state. And Mr. Larraín’s eye for the rugged beauty of Chile’s protean landscapes implies a similar argument. The poet is open to nature and humanity. The policeman is consumed by rules, tactics and procedures. 
Peluchonneau is a tragically constricted soul, but not an entirely unsympathetic character. Neruda is a heroic figure — comic and Dionysian, brilliant and naughty — but his personal Javert is in some ways the film’s protagonist. Neruda is annoyed and sometimes amused by the detective’s doggedness, but Peluchonneau is haunted by the poet’s mystique, and by a growing sense of his own incompleteness. A curious symbiosis develops between them, a dynamic more complex and strange than the simple conflict of good and evil. 
‽
‽Collateral Beauty‽,‽The five stages of grief sometimes seem applicable to movie reviewing, except that I usually skip denial, rarely get around to acceptance and generally just settle into anger, which is where I am with “Collateral Beauty.” Many of the words that I would like to use to describe this waste of talent and time, which riffs on Dickens’s eternal “A Christmas Carol” and tries to manufacture feeling by offing Tiny Tim, can’t be lobbed in a family publication. So, instead, I will just start by throwing out some permissible insults: artificial, clichéd, mawkish, preposterous, incompetent, sexist, laughable, insulting. 
The story involves Howard’s three associates and ostensible friends (Edward Norton, Michael Peña, Kate Winslet) trying to wrest control of the company from him. In his grief, he has written letters to love, time and death, all of which he has a beef with, which suggests he needs real help. Instead, the associates hire actors (Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore, Helen Mirren) to personify these abstractions, the idea being that they will engage Howard while he’s being secretly taped. The associates will then doctor the results to make it look as if he’s talking to himself. It’s a cruel, mercenary strategy, but the movie is selling uplift, not a lesson in 21st-century rapacious capitalism, so their duplicity is delivered with sniffles, smiles and hollow rationalizations. 
‽
‽Short Stay‽,‽Of the many words that might describe Mike (Mike Maccherone), the protagonist of Ted Fendt’s dour, poker-faced comedy, “Short Stay,” “deadbeat” and “slacker” are two that immediately come to mind. 
As it drags along, the movie makes you feel trapped in the shoes of someone destined for failure. The closest thing to a conflict arises when Mark returns from Poland and asks Mike to move out and give him back his job, and Mike resists. He crashes in the apartments of acquaintances and in the saddest image sleeps on a kitchen floor. It is no way to live. 
‽
‽Two Lovers and a Bear‽,‽“Two Lovers and a Bear” begins with two-thirds of the title characters — the lovers — sledding to a frozen body of water, where they then drill holes and do some ice fishing. Passing time while waiting for a bite, the male lover talks about the fact that there are only two musicians that he likes. 
This does not happen. And, eventually, I did come to accept the characters, Roman (Dane DeHaan) and Lucy (Tatiana Maslany), who live in a Canadian town near the North Pole that functions, in their case, as an escape for damaged young souls. 
‽
‽The Wasted Times‽,‽Set against the backdrop of the second Sino-Japanese War, “The Wasted Times” has the outward appearance of being a sweeping gangland epic. But by employing a nonlinear structure, Cheng Er — who wrote, directed and edited this film — severely diffuses the story’s dramatic impact. To think back through the narrative, which spans more than a decade, is to wonder what was gained by withholding details only to reveal them later in flashbacks. 
‽
‽Rogue One: A Star Wars Story‽,‽The great mystery of “Rogue One” — the big payoff, the thing people like me would be pilloried for divulging, the puzzle you will congratulate yourself for solving — is where it fits in with the rest of the “Star Wars” cycle. There are scattered hints early on, and later appearances by familiar characters that elicit chuckles of recognition from fans. The very last shot tells us exactly where we are, and why we should have cared about everything we just saw. 
But the injunction not to ruin anyone’s good time by “revealing spoilers and detailed story points” is itself revealing, an indication of the meager and disposable pleasures this movie is meant to provide, and also of the low regard its makers have for the audience. It hasn’t always been this way, of course. The first “Star Wars” trilogy had a fresh, insurgent energy, and learning the names of all those planets and galactic adventurers has seemed, to generations of fans, like a new and special kind of fun. 
Now, though, it is starting to feel like drudgery, a schoolbook exercise in a course of study that has no useful application and that will never end. “Rogue One,” named for the call sign of an imperial cargo ship appropriated by rebel fighters, is the opposite of that vessel. Masquerading as a heroic tale of rebellion, its true spirit is Empire all the way down. Like the fighters on the planet Scarif, which is surrounded by an all-but-impenetrable atmospheric shield, you are trapped inside this world, subjected to its whims and laws. You can’t escape, because it is the supposed desire to escape that brought you here in the first place. 
Maybe I’m exaggerating. The cast is wonderful. Felicity Jones is a fine addition to the “Star Wars” tradition of tough-minded, quick-thinking heroines. She plays Jyn Erso, the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a scientist whose allegiances are a little ambiguous. Not at all ambiguous is Ben Mendelsohn’s Orson Krennic, a marvel of sneering, vainglorious villainy in an impeccable white uniform, complete with a cape that billows behind him when he strides down a starship catwalk. 
All the pieces are there, in other words, like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven’t really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them. A couple of 9-year-olds on a screen-free rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures, and probably also better dialogue. Plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger Lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. 
You’re left wanting both more and less. There are too many characters, too much tactical and technical explanation, too much pseudo-political prattle. And at the same time, there isn’t quite enough of the filial dynamic between Galen and Jyn, and not enough weight given to the ethical and strategic problems of rebellion. When might ends justify means? What kind of sacrifice is required in the service of a righteous cause? 
‽
‽After Auschwitz‽,‽The anguish that underlies “After Auschwitz” is profound. Yet hope still flickers throughout this documentary, which tells the stories of six Jewish women who survived the Nazi death machine and went on to rebuild their lives in the United States. 
Jon Kean, the director, chose the material wisely and doesn’t shy from severe images. He and his team also have good ears for anecdotes. One woman remembers making clothes from old parachutes. Another tells of pulling her son out of the Boy Scouts; the organization’s uniforms and practices reminded her too much of the Germans. 
‽
‽Breaking Point: The War for Democracy in Ukraine‽,‽The first line of the Ukrainian national anthem is “Ukraine has not yet died,” one interviewee says in “Breaking Point,” a fierce documentary about that country and its recent clashes with Russia. For a land often perched on the edge of ruin, she says, mere survival is something to celebrate. 
Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has been subject to constant pressure from Russia, whose forces seized Crimea in 2014 then intervened to support armed separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 
The filmmakers supply terrifying footage: At civilian rallies, we see nightstick beatings and bloody riots. During military battles, bullets whiz by and explosions shake the cameras. Nerve-racking scenes follow Ukraine’s extraordinarily bold volunteer soldiers. 
‽
‽The Last Family‽,‽The Polish painter Zdzislaw Beksinski is not well known here, but an appreciation of this often funny but also harrowing and heartbreaking film does not require expertise on its subject. I should actually say “subjects.” As per the title, this fictionalized portrait is a family one. The movie opens in 2005, the year of Beksinski’s death, with him making some wry and libidinous comments about future technology to a man we’ll learn was his biographer. It then jumps back to 1977, and Beksinski (Andrzej Seweryn, unimpeachable, as is the rest of the cast) and his wife and mother walk across a plaza from their own apartment block to an unfinished one, where Beksinski’s adult son, Tomasz, will live. At this point Tomasz is already struggling with mental illness. 
‽
‽In the Fade‽,‽“In the Fade,” the new film by Fatih Akin, is divided into three parts. The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to “Law &amp; Order” fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg. 
If the first section of “In the Fade” provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life — the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism — the second part zeros in on the gears of the country’s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous. 
But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back? 
‽
‽All the Money in the World‽,‽“The quality of mercy is not strained,” Portia tells Shylock in “The Merchant of Venice.” It is “twice blest; it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.” The billionaire J. Paul Getty would probably have disagreed with Shakespeare’s take. A hoarder of women, art, antiquities — and most of all, money — Getty also might have taken issue with Portia’s claim that mercy “becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.” Portia delivers her mercy speech as she tries to persuade Shylock not to take a pound of flesh. She would have had an even tougher time with Getty. 
Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn’t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn’t matter. 
Mr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya’s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he’s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It’s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation. 
‽
‽Phantom Thread‽,‽Reynolds Woodcock, a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s, has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (“Never cursed” is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a princess.) These invisible traces of his hand — hidden meanings in the literal sense — signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art, obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator. 
The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It’s just a movie. It’s just a dress. When Reynolds’s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more “chic,” the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions. 
That discrepancy — between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism — may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since “There Will Be Blood,” Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they’re about or who they might be for. 
The difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true. 
‽
‽Happy End‽,‽If you are even only a little familiar with the work of the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, it will come as no surprise that he does not regard instant messaging and smartphones as positive developments for humanity. His latest picture, “Happy End,” begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone, its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman’s routine. 
Like many of Mr. Haneke’s films from the past two decades, “Happy End” is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne’s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in “My Night at Maud’s,” released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in “A Man and a Woman,” 1966) or a fascist dupe (in “The Conformist,” 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie’s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit. 
‽
‽Father Figures‽,‽Moviegoers may recall the basic premise of “Father Figures” from “Flirting With Disaster,” a vastly funnier 1996 comedy by David O. Russell. “Father Figures” doesn’t merely flirt. It stars Ed Helms as Peter and Owen Wilson as Kyle, two of the least-related-seeming twins in history. On the day their mother (Glenn Close) marries some cool cat played by Harry Shearer, they learn that their father isn’t dead, as they thought, but just unknown. Mom didn’t practice monogamy in the disco era. 
‽
‽Bright‽,‽With the buddy-cop fantasy “Bright,” Will Smith and the director David Ayer attempt to chart new territory: an urban action film populated not only by humans but also fantastical creatures like centaurs, fairies, orcs and elves. (If you’re unfamiliar with orcs, check your J. R. R. Tolkien.) The result is a loud, ungainly hybrid that does not serve police procedurals or fantasy spectaculars very well. 
‽
‽Downsizing‽,‽One of my favorite movies of 2017, “War for the Planet of the Apes,” posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine. 
But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn’t that you consume less; it’s that you can have a whole lot more. That’s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong? 
Mr. Payne, who wrote “Downsizing” with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract — in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of “the small” — who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite — is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven’t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers. 
About an hour in, “Downsizing” amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we’ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul’s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau’s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity. 
‽
‽A German Life‽,‽“A German Life” is likely to be the last new movie of its kind: a documentary that presents contemporary testimony from someone who witnessed the inner workings of the Nazi high command. The movie is taken from 30 hours of interviews with Brunhilde Pomsel, who served as a secretary to Joseph Goebbels and was 103 when the film was shot. (She died in January at 106.) 
‽
‽Crooked House‽,‽The premise of the murder mystery “Crooked House” is old school: A much-loathed patriarch is sent to his grave, and a houseful of resentful, back-stabbing kinfolk are under suspicion. This intermittently diverting movie is adapted from a 1949 Agatha Christie novel, and it’s several degrees more engaging than another recent Christie-based movie, “Murder on the Orient Express.” But it’s still slight. 
‽
‽Hangman‽,‽The most and least that can be said for “Hangman” is that it doesn’t approach the mesmerizing ineptitude of “88 Minutes,” another movie that pitted Al Pacino against a serial killer from about a decade ago. This time, the killer carves letters into the victims’ bodies, spelling out a message in a tribute to the children’s word game Hangman. The slick, music video-style opening credits — a staple of this genre since “Seven” — include an ominous box of crayons. 
‽
‽Pitch Perfect 3‽,‽When fans of the wry “Pitch Perfect” series first met the ragtag singing group the Barden Bellas, they were ensconced in the college a cappella bubble. “Pitch Perfect 3” finally bursts that bubble, following the Bellas into adult life. We are reintroduced to the group’s reluctant leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick), as she quits a demeaning record label job. In the same vein, Chloe (Brittany Snow) endures veterinary school, while Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) coasts on her Fat Amy Winehouse impersonation. Discouraged by the demands of the real world, the larger-than-life Bellas reunite to join a U.S.O. tour, where they vie to perform as the opening act for the record producer DJ Khaled (appearing as himself). 
‽
‽The Greatest Showman‽,‽Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.” 
Not much time is wasted on Barnum’s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories. 
‽
‽Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle‽,‽Very few remakes, sequels or franchise reboots have signaled their desperation to connect quite as nakedly as “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” does. The movie opens in 1996 with a young man finding the now-discarded board game that wreaked such havoc on its players in the 1995 Robin Williams movie. The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen’s console, something strange happens. 
The movie derives its humor, such as it is, from the teens’ avatar choices. The nerd gets to be Dwayne Johnson. The big football player gets to be Kevin Hart (who, it is frequently noted, is not tall). The shy, awkward Martha gets to be an expert in dance-fighting (played by Karen Gillan). And the selfie-obsessed girl gets to be, surprise, Jack Black. The crew must navigate a mission that involves a large gem and a villain (Bobby Cannavale) who has insects crawling in and out of his mouth more regularly than is considered normal.

‽Permanent‽,‽Eager to guarantee her social fitness at a new school before the term begins, the teenage Auralie (Kira McLean) badgers her parents, Jean and Jim (Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson), into allowing her to get a permanent. Arguing poverty, Auralie’s mother and father take her to a beauty-training salon for the procedure, and her-once slack locks, left in tight curlers too long, are majorly poofed. Her hair looks like Bob Dylan’s on the cover of his landmark album “Blonde on Blonde.” That was great for Dylan in 1966 New York, but not so much for an adolescent girl “somewhere in Virginia,” according to a title card, in 1982.

‽The Rape of Recy Taylor‽,‽Planting a flag firmly at the intersection of patriarchy, sexism and white supremacy, “The Rape of Recy Taylor” is a documentary of multiple layers and marvelous gumption. As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.

‽Prisoners of the Sun‽,‽Bryan Brown is shaping up as the Australian Gene Hackman, an actor with a never-ending stream of films, most of them well beneath his talents. Mr. Brown's "FX2" and "Sweet Talker" came and went in May. His latest, "Prisoners of the Sun," opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse. It is a sincere, competent courtroom drama that never matches the demands of its historical subject. 
For a few early, harrowing moments, this fictional version of real events is as disturbing as it ought to be. In historical fact, in 1942 the Japanese held 1,100 Australian soldiers in a prisoner-of-war camp on the Indonesian island of Ambon. When the camp was liberated in 1945, only 300 had survived and the Japanese were tried as war criminals. 
"Prisoners of the Sun" begins after the war, when a group of Australian soldiers, led by Mr. Brown as the fictional Capt. Robert Cooper, forces the conquered Japanese to start digging on the island. Before long, rows of dirt-covered skulls and severed bones are lined up on the ground as the Japanese uncover a mass grave where hundreds of executed Australian soldiers were buried. 
What action there is belongs to Cooper, whose job is to prosecute the war criminals. An intelligent but predictably volatile hero, he goes head-to-head and sometimes hand-to-throat with the defendants. He begins with an aristocratic, taciturn vice admiral (played by George Takei, Mr. Sulu from "Star Trek"), who tries to pin the blame on his second-in-command, a man prone to bulldoggish growls of loyalty. 
The most sympathetic defendant is a lowly boyish-looking signals officer named Tanaka, who believed in his duty and his officers and who actually turned himself in for trial. Though this Australian film goes out of its way to avoid Japan-bashing, its Western bias is uneasily revealed through Tanaka, the only "good" Japanese in it and conspicuously the only Christian one as well. 
Cooper, of course, assumes that the vice admiral should be convicted for ordering the executions, but his higher-ups view the Japanese officer as a valuable pawn in reconstructing the postwar world. This bit of realpolitik appalls and astonishes Captain Cooper, who owes more than he should to Gary Cooper. 
The action may take place in a thatched-roof courthouse on an Indonesian island, but the dialogue rings of familiar Hollywood melodrama. When Cooper passionately responds to the sight of Australian bodies at the grave, his commanding officer says: "The war's over. We're lawyers, not soldiers"; Cooper grunts, "Yeah," in sarcastic response. When an American Army officer advises him to let the vice admiral go, Cooper snaps back, "That's not justice: it's politics." It's also not the stuff of absorbing movie scripts, however sincerely felt. 
"Prisoners of the Sun" regains its urgent, horrifying tone only when a dying Australian soldier testifies about his own brother's torture and murder. His flashbacks take the film out of the stuffy, unreal courtroom, giving it a final jolt of reality.

‽Eating‽,‽Of the 38 women who gather for a birthday party in Henry Jaglom's "Eating," almost none of them will touch the cake. And the few willing to do so hide out in solitary places, like the bathroom, so as to commune with dessert in perfect privacy. Food assumes near-religious importance in Mr. Jaglom's portrait of needy, anxious women who spend an entire day playing upon one another's insecurities, and waxing rhapsodic about well-remembered culinary thrills. That perfect bodies are irreconcilable with cream puffs becomes a source of genuine and amusingly well-expressed regret. 
Mr. Jaglom's attitude toward his film's dizzying array of narcissists is extremely fond, which is a lot of what gives "Eating" its warmth and humor. Seen through a colder eye, the film's characters would quickly become insufferable. The subjects under discussion -- the suggestion that someone might need a lower-lids eyelift, or the cry of "I hate my cheeks!" from someone else -- are so relentlessly trivial that after a while they begin to take on a life of their own. Mr. Jaglom makes no higher claims for his characters' importance, but he does claim to understand what makes them miserable, and perhaps that's enough. 
The film's style is colorfully cluttered in the manner of Robert Altman (Mr. Altman's "Wedding," another party epic, comes to mind), but Mr. Jaglom seldom shapes his material quite that well. Few of the roles here are really written, or even as fully conceived as they might have been; much of the film sounds improvised and is allowed to drift. The story's ostensible focus is the 40th birthday of Helene (Lisa Richards), who faces her anxieties by curling up with a muffin and proclaiming that on her birthday she is free to eat anything she wants. A couple of other birthdays provide subsidiary interest, and an excuse to bring on several more birthday cakes. 
As the house fills up with talkative guests and peculiar presents (Helene is given at least two things that qualify as "tools for getting out your suppressed anger"), the overheard and overlapping small talk turns to weight, men, cosmetic issues and career opportunities. A talent agent named Sadie (Marlena Giovi), celebrating her 50th birthday, talks about her younger boyfriend and nags her overweight daughter Jennifer (Daphna Kastner), while elsewhere one of Sadie's clients asks advice on how to abandon Sadie in favor of someone more powerful. "You write her a letter, you give her a present, and then you go with Sam Cohn," another actress advises this would-be deserter. "And you take me with you." 
Meanwhile, Helene's supposed best friend Sophie (Gwen Welles), the film's most fully formed character and its most unremittingly nasty one, foments trouble at every possible opportunity. She concentrates particular attention on the slim, pretty Kate (Mary Crosby), who is sufficiently happy in her marriage to make the other guests wild with disbelief. Among the other principals are a French film maker (Nelly Alard) who inspires waves of resentment and admiration by looking too good in a bathing suit, and Helene's mother, who expresses shock at the silliness of much of what surrounds her. As played by the elegant Frances Bergen, this woman enchantingly recalls an age in which good sense and good form counted for at least as much as a good body. When asked to recall a favorite food, she thinks of caviar. 
Some of the best lines in this leisurely, uneven film -- which opens today at the Cinema Village 12th Street -- are throwaway observations about food and all it stands for. "The last time I had sugar I ate it for five days straight," someone confesses. There are rapturous descriptions of pumpernickel bread and Canadian bacon. Composers are equated with meals (Vivaldi is thought to be like fruit salad). "I'm not really involved with food anymore -- I've found a lot of distractions," says one woman in an extremely peculiar hat. "Like what?" she is asked. "Clothes, men, accessories," she answers. 
"I think I'm still looking for a man who could excite me as much as a baked potato," someone else observes, summing up the film's connections between sex, love, longing and self-imposed starvation. That indeed is food for thought. 
"Eating" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) It includes profanity and brief nudity.

‽The Killer‽,‽Balletic splatter and camp sentimentality have rarely if ever been stretched to the extremes found in John Woo's movie "The Killer." Written and directed by Hong Kong's answer to Sam Peckinpah, the action thriller arrives today at the Village East Cinemas, having already acquired a cult reputation from its showings at the Toronto and Sundance film festivals. 
Alternately gripping and laughable, the movie's mixture of blood and suds suggests an unlikely fusion of "The Wild Bunch" and "Dark Victory," with other movie references thrown into the mix. The most outrageous allusion, to "Duel in the Sun," comes in the final sequence, in which blinded lovers grope toward each other through the blood-soaked dirt for a final clinch and fail to connect. 
Set in contemporary Hong Kong, "The Killer" tells the story of Jeff Chow, a hired gun with a heart of gold who falls in love with a nightclub singer named Jennie, whom he has accidentally blinded during a shoot out. Determined to make enough money to give up his violent ways and pay for the cornea transplants that could restore Jennie's sight, Jeff accepts one final deadly assignment. Having completed the assassination, he speeds off from the scene of a crime in a spectacular motorboat chase with the police. 
The chase is the first move in an extended game of cat and mouse with his pursuer, Inspector Lee, who eventually becomes his ally when the two of them face down the entire Hong Kong underworld in an apocalyptic shootout. By that time, Jeff and Lee are calling each by their pet names, Dumbo and Mickey Mouse. The final confrontation with the mobsters who have double-crossed Jeff takes place -- where else? -- in a pristine chapel filled with lighted candles, a flock of white doves and a statue of the Virgin Mary. 
"The Killer" tells two love stories. The first is about Jeff and Jennie. The second is about Jeff and Lee, antagonists who reluctantly recognize each other as kindred spirits: pure souls who live by a higher code of honor than those around them. Several weepy speeches about friendship, loyalty and honor set the stage for their late-blooming bond to be tested. 
The movie is the third collaboration between the director and the Asian superstar Chow Yun-Fat, who portrays Jeff. The actor glides through the role wearing an enigmatic Mona Lisa smile and gazing down at the world with a dreamy-eyed sadness. At once poetic and suave, the nearly invincible Jeff never loses his cool. Even in the shootouts, in which he is typically outnumbered 10 to 1, he gracefully brandishes two guns, casually shooting from the hip and rarely wasting a bullet, while wearing an expression of anguished sorrow. 
The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong's fog-shrouded skyline. The director repeatedly places the viewer at the center of the crossfire and turns the gyrating camera into the next best thing to a lethal weapon.

‽Misplaced‽,‽In "Misplaced," a proud Polish woman and her teen-age son immigrate to the United States for political reasons, and rebuild their lives in an environment that is often less than friendly. Settling with relatives in Virginia, they must contend with economic hardship, lack of suitable job opportunities, loneliness, and the supercilious behavior of those not eager to make them feel welcome in a new land. 
Halina Nowak (Elzbieta Czyzewska) quickly finds that her mother and half-sister cannot easily accommodate her in their small suburban house, and that after years of separation the family is less than close. ("I always wanted to bring you over, but the time just went by," says Halina's mother, played by Viveca Lindfors.) Halina and her son, Jacek (John Cameron Mitchell), move to a drab apartment and begin the difficult task of making it a home. Meanwhile, Halina also looks for a job. Though she is an accomplished linguist, she can find nothing better suited to her talents than cleaning work at Voice of America headquarters. 
The film -- which opens today at the Quad Cinema -- proceeds quietly, and without any more fire than its title suggests, to show how Halina and Jacek gradually put down roots. As directed by Louis Yansen, who makes his feature debut with this semiautobiographical story, it is often attractively sincere. The women's roles, though, are written (by Mr. Yansen and Thomas DeWolfe) as virtual catnip for any actress equipped to convey noble suffering, and both Miss Czyzewska and Miss Lindfors have many opportunities to play this to the hilt. 
Miss Lindfors, in one scene, confronts street hooligans and shames them into going away. Miss Czyzewska, in another, corners two selfish yuppie women and shames    them    into giving her an audition as a Voice of America announcer. "I am just a cleaning woman, is that it?" she shouts, bristling with anger. Together with Miss Lindfors, who is also supposed to be doing work of this kind, they make the two most stately, dignified cleaning women imaginable. That may be Mr. Yansen's point, but it is overworked. 
Jacek's section of the story is more easygoing. Mr. Mitchell does extremely well in conveying this high school student's shyness, intelligence and eagerness to fit in. Jacek is as obviously superior to his new surroundings as his mother is, but he is less inclined to say so, even to the teen-age girls who make fun of his loud, low-budget American clothes. Mr. Mitchell's Jacek has enough quiet dash to make those teen-age girls eventually see the error of their ways. 
Mr. Yansen's direction is plain and sometimes even blunt, but he succeeds in offering a clear and affecting sense of the Nowaks' ordeal. When Jacek struggles to learn the Gettysburg Address and complains of difficulty with the word "unalienable," his mother erupts with the anger that runs tacitly throughout the story. "A word is too hard?" she cries. "You tell me what is so hard about a word!"

‽Kindergarten Cop‽,‽There are still a few skeptics who laugh at Arnold Schwarzenegger's overwrought muscles, Austrian accent and commitment to the monotone school of acting, but no one laughs at Arnold Schwarzenegger better than Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. As the dense brother who towered over his twin, Danny DeVito, in the hit "Twins," and as the mind-altered hero who tossed off tongue-in-cheek remarks in last summer's blockbuster "Total Recall," he turned his he-man persona to shrewd comic advantage. In "Kindergarten Cop," he plays off the Schwarzenegger image more gleefully and successfully than ever before. 
That is not quite enough to save the movie from its lame, predictable script, even though the concept sounds foolproof: send a tough, hulking policeman undercover as a kindergarten teacher, where he will be at the mercy of screaming whirlwinds tiny enough to snap at his kneecaps. Like "Twins," which was also directed by Ivan Reitman, nothing in "Kindergarten Cop" is as funny as the idea of it. The film relies on obvious jokes, like the little boy who announces to the class the anatomical differences between men and women; those jokes are repeated like nervous tics. But Mr. Schwarzenegger is so appealing, relaxed and genial in this role that his fans are not likely to ask for more and even his detractors are likely to be happily surprised. 
All the Arnold tricks are in place here. He is a thick-skinned, soft-hearted guy named John Kimble, with an excuse for carrying a gun, a fish-out-of-water situation and a stockpile of wise asides. At the start, Kimble chases a ponytailed drug dealer named Crisp through a mall. Handcuffing a witness to the dead body Crisp has just gunned down, Kimble says, "Don't go anywhere." 
Crisp, a man so arrogant and chichi he must be a bad guy, has a gun-toting mama, played by Carroll Baker. And he is after his former wife and son, who have changed their names and fled to the small town of Astoria, Ore. The police know that the child is in the Astoria Elementary School kindergarten class, and Kimble's job is to identify the family before Crisp does. 
Never mind how Kimble gets to play teacher, the job intended for his partner (Pamela Reed). That is just part of the draggy plot exposition that leads to his traumatic first day at school. He survives the experience, but just barely, by distracting the class with his pet ferret, who becomes their mascot. 
He narrows down the list of suspects by playing a game called: "Who is your daddy? What does he do?" The children stand up and say things that are meant to be cute but are usually groaners; the boy obsessed with anatomy is the son of a gynecologist. No one says, "Daddy is a drug dealer," but Kimble narrows the possibilities to a few little boys with fishy stories, and goes on to better games, like "Police School." He puts the children through drills that make them look like miniature marines. 
"You kids are soft!" he growls. "You're not disciplined!" They march in formation chanting, "Too much homework makes me sick." Kimble, of course, turns out to be a wonderful, gentle teacher. Given every chance to mug and go for broad comedy, Mr. Schwarzenegger instead makes Kimble endearingly vulnerable. In "Twins," he seemed to be trying hard to be sweet and funny; here it seems to come naturally. 
Ms. Reed's major function is to promote the romance between Kimble and a pretty young teacher (Penelope Ann Miller), whose son happens to be in his class. The plot is filled with coincidences dreamed up in movieland. But Ms. Reed's is not a thankless role. In one of the funniest scenes, she masquerades as Kimble's sister, Ursula, complete with her own version of the Schwarzenegger accent. 
Unfortunately, the story takes a sharp right turn at the end, veering into violent action that makes "Kindergarten Cop" unsafe for kindergarten children. Imagine taking a small child to a movie in which a stranger arrives and holds a gun to his own son's head, and in which the boy watches his teacher, his father and his grandmother shoot it out in the boys' lavatory. The shoot-'em-up finale is another Schwarzenegger staple, but it is a jarring wrong note in this otherwise congenial film. 
"Kindergarten Cop" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence.

‽The Bonfire of the Vanities‽,‽THE value (and fun) of Tom Wolfe's long, Dickensian-detailed, tirelessly satiric novel, "The Bonfire of the Vanities," is in its democratic approach to ridicule. All men are born trashy.  Those few who aren't have trashiness thrust upon them. 
No one entirely escapes Mr. Wolfe's scorn in his withering, moralistic tale about opportunists running amok in New York City in the mid-1980's. 
They are all there, everyone you might have met at a Park Avenue dinner party or (if you aren't invited to Park Avenue dinner parties) read about in the gossip columns or on page 2 or 3 of the tabloids. The cast is big.  It includes even those who are viewed as supporting players on the edge of the screen in the television coverage of a scandal. 
Wall Street wizards, ambitious politicians, their flunkies, Harlem punks, society women who are see-through thin, ministers with an eye for the main chance, interior decorators, fashionable poets, discarded wives, mistresses on the prowl, plus the cops, the stretch-limo drivers and the other faceless, functional people who service them. 
They are white, black, gentile, Jewish. Mr. Wolfe is an equal-opportunity chronicler of the absurd. 
His New York City is fictional, though it closely resembles the one over which Edward I. Koch presided as Mayor, when Ronald and Nancy Reagan were the pace setters in the White House. 
"The Bonfire of the Vanities" is a historical novel about a time and place in which everything and everybody had a price. This ecumenical approach is what gives "Bonfire" its tone. By being consistent, the novel transcends its own cynicism to become healthily skeptical. 
This is just what Brian De Palma's gross, unfunny movie adaptation does not do. 
The story is a good one. Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks), a well-born successful Wall Street bond salesman, sneaks off to meet his mistress, Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), when she comes into Kennedy Airport from Italy. 
On the way back to town, they take the wrong exit from the Triborough Bridge, winding up in unknown reaches of the Bronx, fearful for their lives as well as for his very expensive, showy imported car. 
After many twists and turns, they come to a lonely dead end where, while they are stopped, they're threatened by two young black men. There's a scuffle. With Maria behind the wheel, they make a desperate getaway, leaving one man badly hit as they run. 
From this small beginning, and faster than an ailanthus tree in a vacant lot, a giant scandal grows. 
When the feckless Sherman, self-styled "master of the universe" for his wheeling and dealing on Wall Street, is arraigned on hit-and-run charges, he becomes everybody's ticket to fame, fortune, community influence or political office. 
The racist Jewish District Attorney Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who wants to be Mayor, sees the case as his chance to convince black voters that he is no racist. The Reverend Bacon (John Hancock), a militant black clergyman, becomes the adviser to and spokesman for the injured man's family. While hospitalized, the injured man himself (Patrick Malone) is made over into a symbol of the city's oppressed, a dedicated scholar and victim of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant heedlessness. 
Orchestrating much of the hoopla is Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), a reporter for a tabloid called The City Light, who uses the story to save his job and then blows it up into a series that wins him a Pulitzer Prize. 
This is the plot, or the bones of it, anyway. It's a touchy one, with something to offend everyone. The novel works, at least in part, because it is so comically rude and so minutely detailed. 
In adapting it to the screen, Mr. De Palma and Michael Cristofer, who wrote the screenplay, have made a series of wrong decisions that have the effect of both softening the satire and making it seem more uncomfortably racist than the Wolfe original. 
As if to echo the novel's overstatement, and to tell the audience that what it's seeing is truth exaggerated, Mr. De Palma and his cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond, favor the use of lenses that give ordinary people the faces of gargoyles, and oddball camera angles that suggest a horror film more often than a social satire. 
The sets are alternately too much -- too fancy -- and too little, that is, utterly realistic. The movie never seems to know what it's supposed to be. It wobbles. 
The casting isn't ideal. Mr. Hanks comes off best as the bewildered victim. He's nobody's idea of a prototypical Yale man, which is the way he's described in the novel, but he's a good comic actor. It also helps that Sherman McCoy, a sort of late-20th-century Candide, is required to do little more than respond to the viciousness of others. 
Mr. Willis and Miss Griffith play their roles as straight as possible, but still seem to be cyphers. Their roles are flat, but without having the clear-cut definition of the cartoon figures that surround them. 
This is why the members of the supporting cast seem so much more vivid. They play one-dimensional comic types who get on and off fast: Mr. Abraham, Kim Cattrall (Mr. Hanks's socially proper wife), Saul Rubinek (an ambitious but dimwitted assistant district attorney), Robert Stephens (a publisher possibly suggested by Rupert Murdoch). 
Off in left field somewhere is Morgan Freeman, who appears as the movie's conscience, an invention of Mr. Cristofer and Mr. De Palma. He is the black judge (in the novel, he is Jewish) who, at the end of the film, delivers an upbeat sermon on justice (also an invention) devised to deny the validity of just about everything that has gone on before. 
There's nothing especially wrong with the words, but they don't fit the movie they're in. 
More surprising is what seems to be the film's technical flaws. There are times when the dialogue sounds disconnected from the speaker, as if post-synchronized. Some scenes are awkwardly staged, including the initial confrontation in the Bronx. In one brief love scene, Miss Griffith's body appears to be so perfect as to look surgically reconstructed. 
Perhaps not, but "The Bonfire of the Vanities" is so wildly uneven that everything in it seems open to question.   "The Bonfire of the Vanities" has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes partial nudity and vulgar language.

‽The Russia House‽,‽"The Russia House," the screen adaptation of John le Carre's post-Cold War spy novel, comes on like a drill sergeant who talks fast and feeds the recruits more information than they can possibly absorb, the aim being to intimidate them into woozy submission. 
There is the same overwhelming aggressiveness to the first 30 minutes of "The Russia House." The aim in this case is apparently to convince the audience that the film is far more complex than, in fact, it ever becomes. 
The scene is not set, it is fractured.  There is a lot of cross-cutting among locations and characters not immediately identified, with conversations heard on the sound track that don't connect to the images. There is, overall, a simulated sense of peril promising suspense that never comes. 
As directed by Fred Schepisi and written by Tom Stoppard, "The Russia House" is confused and dim, far less complex, and even far less fun, than almost any le Carre work yet brought to the screen, excluding "The Little Drummer Girl." 
The movie also betrays what could be the desperation of a novelist trying to wring one last tale out of the Cold War, which, in light of current events, is beginning to look as if it were a golden era of political, economic and social tranquillity. 
"The Russia House" is about Barley Blair (Sean Connery), a hard-drinking, easygoing, healthily skeptical London publisher who suddenly finds himself recruited by British intelligence. His mission: to find the Russian author of a manuscript, originally intended for Barley, which reveals Soviet military might to be that of a second-rate power. 
It turns out that the author is a brilliant Russian scientist, code-named Dante (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who had been charmed by Barley's independence of mind when the two met some months earlier at a writers' conference in the Soviet Union. 
Though Gorbachev's Soviet Union is now open, Dante tells Barley, it is not so open that it would sanction the publication of military secrets of such an embarrassing nature. Dante's stated aim is to shake up the Soviet military bureaucracy and to persuade the West that, threatened by no real threat, it can disarm. 
Barley clearly doesn't read spy novels. In the course of his mission, he is astonished to realize that the members of the military-intelligence complexes in Great Britain and the United States share their Soviet counterparts' distaste for such a breakthrough in international relations. 
The military-intelligence people care more about job security than the fate of the planet. Barley, the hunter, becomes the hunted. 
That is more or less the substance of "The Russia House," which has been photographed at what looks to have been great expense in the Soviet Union, Portugal, Canada and England. The locations in Leningrad and in and around Moscow are splendidly photogenic. 
Also photogenic, and much more than that, is Michelle Pfeiffer, who gives the film's most persuasive performance as the Russian woman who acts as the initial go-between for Dante and Barley. It's not a terribly rich role but it's a clean-cut one, and Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie. 
Mr. Brandauer, also, is good, but everyone else seems upstaged by a combination of fancified screenplay and direction. 
That includes the usually magnetic Mr. Connery, whose forceful screen presence is at odds with Barley, a glib, lazy sort of man who discovers himself during this adventure. Mr. Connery goes through the movie as if driving in second gear. 
The supporting cast includes Roy Scheider, James Fox, J. T. Walsh and Ken Russell (the director), all acting like actors trying very hard to find the interesting aspects of characters who have none. They appear as intelligence and military men of various temperaments. 
The only one who stands out is Mr. Russell. With his unpressed white hair and his beetling way of walking, he behaves in the busy, gadfly fashion one would expect of the man who made "The Music Lovers," "Tommy" and "Salome's Last Dance." 
There is evidence of Mr. Stoppard's wit in the dialogue, but the lines are not easily spoken, which is not to say that they are unspeakable. They are clumsy. Sometimes they are even over-ripe, as when the Pfeiffer character, recalling a love affair, tells Barley that she lost her innocence the same night that Soviet tanks entered Prague. 
The narrative structure is a mess.  Whether this is the responsibility of Mr. Stoppard, Mr. Schepisi or of the film editors, working independently, I've no idea. It is frequently inscrutable.   "The Russia House," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language.

‽Almost an Angel‽,‽In "Almost an Angel," Paul Hogan plays a jocular born-again Christian, a former thief named Terry Dean who begins proselytizing after being hit by a car. Wandering through the film amiably and giving out copious free advice, Terry becomes so devout that he assures a character whose loved one has just died that this is barely even bad news. It will be a true miracle if "Almost an Angel" attracts even a small audience, let alone finds its way to a place alongside Mr. Hogan's "Crocodile Dundee" in box-office heaven. 
Mr. Hogan remains a modest, benign comic figure, but the energy that has been spent on keeping him busy here could barely run a light bulb. His own screenplay, which has him dressing up as Rod Stewart and Willie Nelson for two brief sight gags, otherwise gives him little to do but dispense homilies, befriend a paraplegic (Elias Koteas), help disadvantaged children and court a nice but uninteresting young woman (Linda Kozlowski, Mr. Hogan's familiar co-star). 
Also in the film is Charlton Heston, appearing in long, flowing robes and a white beard as the kind of deity to whom Mr. Hogan can make wisecracks. As Terry, he makes frequent asides to God. "Listen, mate," he whispers confidentially at one point, "I guess you've been asked this question a million times, but . . . is Elvis with you?" Unless one finds that desperately funny, the rest of the film is hopeless. 
"Almost an Angel" was non descriptly directed by John Cornell, whose credits include Mr. Hogan's Australian television show, Mr. Hogan's most successful commercials, and the marketing and television presentation of World Series Cricket, as well as "Crocodile Dundee."   "Almost an Angel" is rated PG-13 ("Parents strongly cautioned"). It contains mildly irreverent dialogue.

‽Mermaids‽,‽The flamboyant Mrs. Flax is too much, which means that she's just about right for Cher, who plays her to the teeth (and nose and hair) in Richard Benjamin's sweet-natured new comedy, "Mermaids." 
Mrs. Flax dresses in a way that might be expected to cause male passers-by to walk into trees. Skirts are tight. Necklines plunge. Wigs tower. She's not the sort of mom who bakes apple pies. 
Every meal at home is presented on a platter, often with toothpicks, as if it were something to nibble on with cocktails. Mrs. Flax's favorite supper: finger food followed by marshmallow kebabs. 
"She thinks anything more represents too much of a commitment," says her teen-age daughter, Charlotte (Winona Ryder). 
Mrs. Flax is ahead of her time, which is 1963. She depends on no man to support her, to help raise her two daughters or to give her more than passing sexual comfort. She is liberated with a relentless vengeance, the sort of character that is beloved in fiction and hell-on-wheels in fact. 
"Mermaids," adapted by the English writer June Roberts from the novel by Patty Dann, is a terribly gentle if wisecracking comedy about the serious business of growing up. 
Though Cher's cheeky, broad, comically self-assured performance dominates the movie, "Mermaids" is really about Charlotte, who is 15 years old and who is a startling combination of sophistication and ignorance. 
As played by Miss Ryder, who is enchanting and funny, and firmly in control of every scene not handed to Cher, Charlotte is a potentially rich character. Miss Ryder is so good, in fact, that "Mermaids" might have dared to be a tougher, more satisfying movie than the stylish sitcom it is.  "Mermaids" is a smooth, unexceptional entertainment about coming of age in a world where truly bad things happen only on television. 
Because the year is 1963, much is made of the television coverage of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, but life in East Port, Mass., where the Flaxes are living temporarily, is never profoundly threatened nor, for that matter, experienced. 
Charlotte is going through all sorts of contradictory emotions. She's in love with Roman Catholicism, especially with female saints and martyrs. She even has a shrine in her room. 
At one point her mother, preparing for a date, sashays by the door and finds Charlotte on her knees in front of the shrine. "Charlotte," Mrs. Flax says dryly, "we're Jewish." 
Though Charlotte wants to devote herself to the church, she is also obsessed by erotic desires, which are soon centered on a good-looking, utterly vacuous young man who drives her school bus. Eventually, the same young man catches Mrs. Flax's fancy, with predictable emotional ramifications for Charlotte. 
For most of the film, Mrs. Flax's attentions are given to the local shoe-store owner, Lou Landsky, which is a secondary role that Bob Hoskins transforms into a fine comic turn. 
Lou is nobody's idea of a Romeo, certainly not Mrs. Flax's. Yet by sheer nerve, wit and common sense he manages to melt some of the ice surrounding Mrs. Flax's emotional reserve. 
The youngest Flax is Kate, nicely played by Christina Ricci. Each of the three Flaxes is meant to suggest some aspect of the mythical creatures of the film's title. Each is in some manner caught between two worlds, at home in neither. 
The title might also refer to the fact that in a New Year's Eve sequence, Mrs. Flax goes to a costume party dressed in the kind of mermaid costume that would wow them in Las Vegas. The credits say the costume was "built by" Patty Spinale and Gail Baldoni of the Boston Ballet Company. 
The performance inside the costume was engineered entirely by Cher. 
"Mermaids" has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some vulgar language and mild sexuality.

‽
‽Look Who's Talking Too‽,‽First the good news: Mikey, the boy whose street-smart thoughts have been given voice by Bruce Willis in "Look Who's Talking" and now "Look Who's Talking Too," looks almost old enough to speak for himself. In a world ruled by reason, that would make a third go-round out of the question. 
Sadly, a movie sequel as desperate as "Look Who's Talking Too" is not the product of a reasonable world. It should be noted, for starters, that Mikey's mother, Mollie (Kirstie Alley), had a second child at the end of the original film, a girl who sounded like Joan Rivers and who has not been heard from again. 
Instead, in "Look Who's Talking Too," Mollie and her husband, James (John Travolta), become the parents of an entirely different daughter, this one also named Julie, with a wisecracking inner voice supplied by Roseanne Barr. Aside from this, and from James having regained his figure, very little has happened to these parents in the interim. The new film, written by Amy Heckerling (who also directed) and Neal Israel, has virtually nothing beyond the talking-baby gimmick to keep it going. 
A few indications of just how bankrupt this becomes: 
The new film is constantly bolstered by pop songs ("Catch Us if You Can," sing boisterous sperm cells racing to attack an egg), and has many more musical romps than it has plot turns. The two children are, of course, seen frolicking to the tune of "I Got You Babe." "Sea of Love," which should be considered off-limits after its use as another film's title    and    in a ubiquitous perfume ad campaign, is also included. 
The automatic montage recapitulating all the fun Mollie and James have had together comes midway through it, instead of being saved for the end. The fun looks tired, anyhow. 
A lot of the jokes are about toilet training, including stories told by another baby (with voice by Damon Wayans) about a fearsome creature called Mr. Toilet Man. This being actually appears, in the form of a talking toilet with voice by Mel Brooks. 
The jokes that aren't about diapers are mostly about accounting. 
And the dramatic moment when Julie takes her first steps is not even accompanied by the strains of "Thus Spake Zarathustra," as might have been expected. Instead, it's the music of the Tri-Star leaping horse logo. (The horse also talks during the film's actual opening credits.) 
The film's few mild laughs, which occur in spite of all this, mostly come from Ms. Barr's histrionic readings of a baby's self-important thoughts. "Well, at least I've achieved most of my goals," she sighs in utero, while imagining she will perish at birth.  "Will this pain    ever    go away?" she wails, upon receiving her first injection. Mr. Willis, whose savvy sound for Mikey has indeed been a valuable contribution to the film's formula, adds some amusingly pointed complaints about sibling rivalry. ("She's up! She's mobile! She's movin'! She's headin' right for my toys!") But for the most part, the voices are a lot funnier than the dialogue. 
Among the non-baby actors, who are mostly here to be upstaged, Mr. Travolta is again easygoing and likable, though largely wasted. A sequence in which he dances like Elvis for a kiddie gym class ought to be show stopping, but is instead so clumsily shot and edited that it falls flat. Ms. Alley's sitcom timing, while unsurprising, is just right for generating signs of life where none really exist. Also in the cast are Elias Koteas and Olympia Dukakis as Mollie's oddball brother and mother, though neither has much to do. 
Among the more dubious touches in "Look Who's Talking Too" are a conception sequence that is staged as an attack and a burning-house sequence that finds the film's two child stars (Lorne Sussman and Megan Milner) toddling unsupervised through a flaming kitchen. It's alarming even to wonder how the latter was filmed. 
"Look Who's Talking Too" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It includes sexual situations, profanity and kiddie-level bathroom jokes. Look Who's Talking Too  Directed by Amy Heckerling; written by Ms. Heckerling and Neal Israel; director of photography, Thomas Del Ruth; edited by Debra Chiate; music by David Kitay; production designer, Reuben Freed; produced by Jonathan D.

‽
‽The Sheltering Sky‽,‽Bernardo Bertolucci's "Sheltering Sky" is about sliding over the edge into oblivion, but going in style. 
The time is shortly after the end of World War II, when the civilized world is still trying to rediscover the reassuring boundaries of commonplace routine. Three exceptions are Port Moresby, his wife, Kit, and their friend George Tunner. 
Port (John Malkovich), an American composer who no longer composes, Kit (Debra Winger), who once wrote a Broadway play that received respectful but unenthusiastic notices, and Tunner (Campbell Scott), who gives cocktail parties on Long Island, arrive by tramp steamer at Tangier, Morocco, en route to the Sahara. 
They might have gone to Italy but the war, at great inconvenience to them, has messed it up. 
The way they enter the film is significant -- Port, followed by Kit, followed by Tunner. Each appears first as a head, then as a head supported by a torso, and finally in full figure as each climbs the steps from the small-boat landing below to reach the sun-drenched quay above. 
They stand there, for a few moments at loose ends, suddenly oppressed by the astonishing intensity of the North African heat. In response to a remark by Tunner, Port says rather grandly that they are certainly not tourists. Says Kit, they are travelers. 
By their definition, tourists merely pass through on a fixed schedule, always to return someplace other. Travelers move at their own speed, remaining in one spot a week, a month or a year or two, as the mood dictates. Travelers need never return. 
Yet these three are like tourists in that they are in transit, and time is running out. 
Port, Kit and Tunner are separated not only from the boredom of the known world they have left behind, but also from one another. Forever. This human condition is the illusive substance of "The Sheltering Sky," possibly Mr. Bertolucci's most seductive, most hypnotic movie. 
The film opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse. 
"The Sheltering Sky" is a long, beautifully modulated cry of despair. It's the sort of dark, romantic movie that only Mr. Bertolucci ("The Conformist," "Last Tango in Paris" and "The Last Emperor") could bring off without allowing audiences to wonder, even briefly, about the self-absorption of the characters. 
That they never seem foolish or superfluous is due to the intensity of the film itself, adapted by Mark Peploe and Mr. Bertolucci from the 1949 Paul Bowles novel. 
Whether or not the movie will have the same impact on someone who hasn't read the novel is difficult to say. It is, after all, impossible to disremember a novel as vivid as "The Sheltering Sky" once it has been read. 
Yet the film somehow manages to find cinema equivalents to the Bowles prose in which exterior and inner landscapes are evoked with the same fine clarity of expression. The novel sort of browses through the minds of Port, Kit and Tunner, and even through the minds of some of the pragmatic, nameless Africans they meet in their journey to the interior. 
The novel is very much of its own immediate postwar era, when tales of alienation were on the brink of becoming as fashionable as Christian Dior's "new look," which put women into skirts that virtually denied the existence of their legs. 
Mr. Bowles's vocabulary evokes another kind of chic doom. 
"There was a certitude of sadness at the core of his consciousness," he writes of Port at one point. "She," in reference to Kit, "had no reactions at all; her entire personality withdrew from sight." Or, of Port, "He had long since come to deny all purpose to the phenomenon of existence." 
These are not easy attitudes to animate. "Glacial deadness" (another of the novelist's phrases) is not something that leaps off the screen like a chariot race. 
As long as the film is unfolding, though, "The Sheltering Sky" rivets the attention. Only when it ends does the mind go back to wonder what, exactly, it has just seen. 
Would this story of a marriage in stalemate, of lives in stasis, of one couple's desperate attempt to get off dead-center, have been as entertaining if Port were an alienated insurance salesman in Queens and Kit a dissatisfied den mother? 
Probably not, but then that's to take the sociology of the movie (and the novel) more literally than is necessary. "The Sheltering Sky" is not about insurance salesmen and it could be set nowhere but in North Africa. 
The Sahara is a magnificent metaphor for a universe that is overwhelming in its vastness and complexity, but also as simple and finite as a grain of sand. 
Like the novel, which is piercing and specific even when it is describing emotional inertia, the movie makes the unhappy love story of Port and Kit seem vital, and inseparable from the terrain in which it all comes to an end. This adaptation represents a tough job unusually well done. 
For the most part, the screenplay successfully translates arcane inner thoughts into dialogue that is speakable and sometimes even mordantly funny. Mr. Bertolucci also observes Port and Kit and Tunner in such a way that a remarkable amount of the Bowles novel is reflected in behavior and manner. 
The only time a certain desperation becomes apparent is when Mr. Bowles himself, now a well-preserved 80 years old, is placed in the film frame. He is seen in a couple of sequences set in a Tangier cafe. He serves briefly as a kind of witness to the events, offering comments that, unlike the rest of the dialogue, sound like truncated sentences from a literary work. His wary physical presence might have been enough. 
Reduced to its plot essentials, "The Sheltering Sky" is a sort of existential update on Rudolph Valentineo's old chestnut, "The Sheik." 
Port, Kit and Tunner move in edgy stages farther and farther from civilization into the desert. As the geography becomes more barren and more exotic and more fly-infested, they become more desperate. 
Port wants to shake himself out of his spiritual lethargy. In Tangier, he has an erotic encounter with a young, full-breasted Arab girl and, for some reason, is even more satisfied when he is beaten and robbed afterward. 
Kit longs for Port to renew the passion that seems worn out after 10 years of marriage. They have two brief sexual encounters, but his mind is not on her. She turns to the handsome, comparatively square, adoring Tunner, whom she can barely tolerate. 
(In this sort of literature, characters are inevitably bored to the teeth by circumstances that would be dreams come true for many readers and moviegoers. The ruder North African smells might not delight, but they can't be shared by either a novel or a movie.) 
Along the way they meet a voracious harpy of an Englishwoman (Jill Bennett), a travel writer and photographer, and her pudgy alcoholic son (Timothy Spall), who's also a thief and, eventually, the story's catalyst.  Port comes down with typhoid, but still he and Kit push on to the south. 
There are revelations and reconciliations and a final act of what amounts to remarkable, positive renunciation. More cannot be revealed. 
Mr. Malkovich and Miss Winger are extraordinarily fine as the lovers, each being just idiosyncratic enough to take the curse off the exoticism in which the movie is awash. Mr. Scott's role is that of straight man to the two crooked personalities he idolizes. 
Miss Bennett, who died not long after the film was completed, and Mr. Spall are viciously funny. Eric Vu-An, a ballet dancer of French and Vietnamese parentage, makes a brief appearance in a role that could have been played by Valentino, though in a very different kind of movie. 
"The Sheltering Sky" is stunning to look at (Vittorio Storaro was the cameraman), but it is never simply picturesque. It mesmerizes. 
At one point in the novel, Mr. Bowles writes of Port, "It takes energy to invest life with meaning, and at present this energy was lacking." 
It's one of the contradictions built into such fiction that it also takes tremendous energy and skill to write a novel, or make a movie, about isolation of such a profound sort. Mr. Bertolucci's energy and skill match those of Mr. Bowles. 
"The Sheltering Sky," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or guardian), includes full frontal nudity.

‽
‽Havana‽,‽The romance of Sydney Pollack's sprawling, atmospheric "Havana" is real, but it has almost nothing to do with love. Instead it concerns a place, the city of the title, which is hurtling toward irrevocable change and is very near the brink. The year is 1958, the time a densely eventful week between Christmas Eve and New Year's, in the last moments before the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista's regime. The mood, as shaded by these circumstances, is one of abandon, denial, desperate festiveness and mad risk-taking in the face of imminent danger. 
Drawn across this wildly colorful canvas is a halting, equivocal love story in shades of gray. "Havana" brings together Jack Weil (Robert Redford), an inveterate gambler ready to test himself by taking the chance of a lifetime, and Bobby Duran (Lena Olin), a much younger, more mundane beauty who is linked by marriage to Fidel Castro's cause. At her most blandly idealistic, Bobby talks of the revolutionary spirit as being "like a song people sing together." 
"You want to change the world, Bobby?" Jack counters, once the two have established a bantering conversational intimacy, if not much of a physical one. "Change me." But in spite of Mr. Pollack's best efforts, a screenplay (by Judith Rascoe and David Rayfiel) that devotes long and loving analysis to Jack and Bobby's uneasy involvement, and most of all a seemingly irresistible dramatic model (namely "Casablanca"), the problems of these two little people never truly count for much more than a hill of beans. 
Why not? Casting is part of the reason, and not simply because the two stars seem so noticeably incompatible. Mr. Redford, intuitive and dashing as ever in scenes that let him match wits with male actors who are his contemporaries, looks weathered and remote beside the fresh-faced Miss Olin, who for her part appears barely friendly at times. Mutual respect and admiration flow intermittently between them. But there are no real surprises, and certainly no sparks. 
Mr. Redford's great strength, especially in other films Mr. Pollack has directed (among them "Out of Africa," "Three Days of the Condor" and "The Way We Were"), is an ability to turn diffidence into a form of flirtation, exploring the hazy area between contact and escape. But "Havana" treats him as a romantic aggressor rather than an elusive prize, so that he is in fact more magnetic during other parts of this story than he is during its love scenes. The film's determinedly amorous moments are not helped by the screenplay, which swings unpredictably between the moodily eloquent and the merely weary. "You are    seriously    beautiful," Jack must tell Bobby in one scene. "For a moment I was lost -- in a sweet place, but lost," she says much later. 
Jack and Bobby meet on shipboard, where he is caught up in a card game; soon he and this beautiful stranger have joined forces to attempt a greater gamble. Bobby enlists Jack to smuggle contraband from the ship into the city, and not until he is back in Havana does Jack grasp the real purpose of this: Bobby is the wife of a prominent revolutionary leader (Raul Julia, in a hearty though uncredited appearance) and is deeply linked to the cause. By the time Jack understands, he is deeply involved in his own right, fascinated by Bobby if not by her political mission. 
Meanwhile, Jack pursues other interests in Havana. He makes contact with a jaded, knowing casino operator (played with a fine wryness by Alan Arkin), and positions himself to await a big gambling score. After Bobby and her husband disappear during a military raid, Jack finds himself playing cards with their captors, perhaps even their killers (among them Tomas Milian, as a memorably cynical Cuban officer). There is, in this authentically high stakes game, an irony and forboding that give the film a welcome toughness. "These people want to bring down everything you're here for!" exclaims one of Jack's new poker-playing acquaintances, speaking aptly of the imminent revolution. 
The glittering decadence of this culture on the verge of collapse is in fact the film's most fascinating aspect, and Mr. Pollack has re-created it extravagantly. Filmed in the Dominican Republic, "Havana" presents its potent and expressive vision of the title city as an extension of its denizens' state of mind. Mr. Arkin's casino operator is quick to point out that the all-out dissoluteness of this nearly extinct Havana, a place of gambling dens and strip joints and lazy all-night debauches (Mr. Redford has a casual tryst with two women early in the story), is somehow mutable and even portable. If Havana should cease to be the right setting for these activities, Mr. Arkin says reasonably, then the activities will simply move to another part of the world. 
Among the film's most stunning images of cataclysmic change is its New Year's Eve stampede of diamond-decked revelers in evening clothes, who are frantically fleeing the wolf at the door. At moments like this, "Havana" truly captures the electrifying peril of its place and time. And Jack Weil, with his passion for gambling, becomes one of the rare spectators with a clear view of the historic events unfolding around him. Gamblers are drawn to the card games in Havana, he says at one point, "because they're looking for something they can do something about." 
"Havana" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, mild profanity and sexually suggestive situations.

‽
‽The Rookie‽,‽"The Rookie," directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is a jokey buddy-cop movie in which car thieves are the perpetrators, but the highlight is not a fight, a brawl, a shoot-out or even a chase. 
It's a scene in which Mr. Eastwood puts himself in the position of Pearl White, in another example of the sort of role reversals that have become so popular in movies these days. 
Strapped to a chair, his hands tied behind him, Mr. Eastwood is sexually assaulted by Sonia Braga, still best known here for "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands." They are a well-matched pair, both having been around the block a few times. 
Mr. Eastwood plays a veteran Los Angeles cop, whom time has made so sere that he looks as flammable as a dead pine tree. Miss Braga is the karate-chopping cocaine-sniffing hit woman for the car thieves. 
Unlike Miss White, whose ramparts were forever threatened but never breached, Mr. Eastwood somehow successfully submits to his captor. How can he resist? Miss Braga begins her mating dance by slicing his forehead with a razor blade, then threatening him with emasculation. 
It's all meant in good fun, but it isn't. It's tired. 
"The Rookie" is an astonishingly empty movie to come from Mr. Eastwood. 
As a director, he sometimes overreaches himself ("Bird"), but his ambitions are usually noble ("White Hunter, Black Heart"). When not thinking grandly, he has made some effective, entertaining westerns and action movies, including "Pale Rider" and "Heartbreak Ridge." 
The screenplay for "The Rookie" seems to have been pumped up from a script originally intended as a segment for a half-hour television series.  There's not much of a story. 
Instead, the movie devotes itself to extended set pieces, mostly chases, which are so lazily thought out and edited that the audience is always ready for the twists that are supposed to surprise. Even the Los Angeles locations, including one made memorable by "Beverly Hills Cop," are distractingly familiar. 
Charlie Sheen plays the rookie cop who, in the course of the mayhem, proves himself to his older partner.  Raul Julia appears as the bloodthirsty fiend who masterminds the thefts of the fancy cars, often from the parking lots of expensive restaurants. 
It's a crime but, as social nuisances (and movie subjects) go, this one ranks alongside pigeon feeding. 
"The Rookie" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes vulgar language and explicit violence.

‽
‽Edward Scissorhands‽,‽AT the far end of a suburban enclave, where the houses huddle together like a candy-colored wagon train, there stands a monument to lonely genius. Atop a forbidding gray mountain, in yet another of the strange and ingenious outposts that the heroes of Tim Burton's films ("Batman," "Beetlejuice," "Pee-wee's Big Adventure") call home, Edward Scissorhands lives in isolation. He uses his extraordinary gifts to create magical artworks that, he imagines, no one will ever see. 
Edward has apparently hidden here for a long time, with nary a trip to the grocery store. But one day, as seems perfectly reasonable in the ripe, fanciful pop universe in which "Edward Scissorhands" unfolds, a thoughtful Avon lady (Dianne Wiest) pays a visit. Seeing Edward, she immediately grasps that he has a problem and sweetly imagines that it can be solved with kindness, not to mention the makeup base of exactly the right hue. So the Avon lady brings the outcast back to her home, where he amazes the neighbors with his rare feats of snippery. He's a wizard when it comes to poodles. 
In a sense, Mr. Burton is too. His "Edward Scissorhands" is as crazily single-minded as a majestic feat of dog barbering, with much the same boldness, camp ebullience and fundamentally narrow wit. Like a great chef concocting an exquisite peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich, Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small. In the case of "Edward Scissorhands," which opens today at the Ziegfeld, that something is a tale of misunderstood gentleness and stifled creativity, of civilization's power to corrupt innocence, of a heedless beauty and a kindhearted beast. The film, if scratched with something much less sharp than Edward's fingers, reveals proudly adolescent lessons for us all. 
On, then, to the better side of "Edward Scissorhands": the tremendous cleverness with which Mr. Burton brings these ideas to life. As embodied by Johnny Depp, Edward himself is a stunning creation, with a blackish cupid's-bow mouth and plaintive expression to offset his fright hairdo, abundant scars and potentially lethal hands. 
Those hands, which quiver uncontrollably when Edward experiences strong emotion, are the one aspect of the young man that his creator (played by Vincent Price, who was a hero of Mr. Burton's when the director was still a young Disney animator) neglected to complete. The inventor died just before he could equip Edward with human hands, thus leaving him with these scissor-bladed prototypes. They make a great sight gag, if not a great metaphor. 
As in each of Mr. Burton's films, the production design is the central good idea, perhaps even the sole one.  This time, with production design by Bo Welch ("Beetlejuice") and cinematography by Stefan Czapsky, it involves bright colors in unlikely combinations, for instance, a lavender-suited Avon lady driving a dandelion-yellow car) and fashionably ridiculous late-1950's artifacts placed prominently throughout the characters' bunkerlike homes. On the lawns of these houses, more and more of Edward's singular topiaries -- in the forms of a ballerina, a penguin, a set of bowling pins and so on -- begin to appear. 
It is very much in keeping with the film's fearless, defiant illogic that these shrubbery sculptures should appear where no shrubs grew before. Similarly, the film makes no bones about depicting Winona Ryder as a white-haired granny in the not noticeably futuristic prologue, and as a high school girl, circa 1960, when most of the action takes place. Ms. Ryder, in the former capacity, promises to explain to a grandchild what the story of Edward Scissorhands has to do with snowfall. It's also in keeping with the film's reasoning that the explanation for this, when finally revealed, isn't nearly as interesting as promised. 
Ms. Ryder plays Kim Boggs, the daughter of the Avon lady, Peg, and a dryly deadpan patriarch (played by Alan Arkin). As lovely as she is diffident, she makes an enchanting Beauty to Mr. Depp's poignant, bashful Beast. When Edward first arrives in suburbia, he is so flustered that he scares Kim away. (He also inadvertently punches holes in her waterbed.) But he soon becomes part of the household and part of the community, despite insensitive questions -- like "Do you know about bowling?" -- from the locals. 
Soon Edward is so much at home that he is virtually a household convenience, helping Peg snip threads when she sews. He also becomes extremely popular with the women of the neighborhood, some of them fascinated by his knack for inventing odd haircuts, and one (played with funny flamboyance by Kathy Baker) especially interested in discovering his other talents. The women in the film, with the exceptions of Peg and Kim, are ninnies, but the men are no more flatteringly presented. Kim's boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) is a lout, a bully and the cause of Edward's eventual undoing. 
Among the film's more haunting visual touches, all of which linger much longer than the possible reasons for their inclusion, are the peculiar shrinelike assemblage of clippings in Edward's fireplace; the bladelike beams that open a hole in his roof to the heavens and the inventor's cherished machinery, so pleasantly antiquated that the machines seem to have animal faces. The traces of warmth that spring up unexpectedly, even in the sequence that finds Edward and Kim amid snow and ice, are what save "Edward Scissorhands" from its own potential archness and give it the sweetness of a bona-fide fairy tale. "Edward Scissorhands" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual suggestiveness and occasional rude language.

‽Company Business‽,‽"You're both dinosaurs," a comparatively neutral observer tells the two bewildered former cold war spies in Nicholas Meyer's new espionage melodrama, "Company Business." They are Sam Boyd (Gene Hackman), an American, and Pyotr Grushenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov), a Russian, who have joined forces to flee the coordinated wrath of the Central Intelligence Agency and the K.G.B. 
The neutral observer fails to notice that if the two men are dinosaurs, then their adventure must be antediluvian. 
Though "Company Business," which opened here yesterday, is slickly acted and photographed, it has the monotonous one-two-three, one-two-three tempo of a waltz that begins in Fort Worth and lumbers on to Washington, Berlin and Paris. 
The long-retired Sam is brought back by the C.I.A., the "company" of the title, to effect the swap of a Russian prisoner, Pyotr, for an American U-2 pilot still held in Moscow. 
Things inevitably go wrong. It's not giving anything away to reveal that the C.I.A. isn't up to any good, dealing, as it is, with money provided by a Colombian drug cartel. Sam and Pyotr quickly realize that each is the other's best friend. 
The movie has a funny scene involving a Saudi Arabian arms merchant in Berlin, a rather superfluous scene set in a Berlin drag bar, and a small shootout on the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Mr. Hackman, who has played this role before, and Mr. Baryshnikov, who hasn't, are both sturdy if a little tired. Under the direction of Mr. Meyer, who also wrote the screenplay, the film makes sense without ever being surprising.   "Company Business," which has been rated PG-13 (Some material may be unsuitable for those under 13), includes some vulgar language and violence.   COMPANY BUSINESS

‽Final Approach‽,‽Eric Steven Stahl's film "Final Approach" is a cinematic maze, a high-technology head trip in which the roles of director, film editor, computer animator and sound designer have blurred. 
In the spectacular opening sequences, Col. Jason Halsey (James B.  Sikking), a test pilot flying close to the ground over the Southwestern desert, crashes after his plane is struck by lightning. On waking, he finds himself in the spare, futuristic office of a psychiatrist (Hector Elizondo) who pelts him with questions he cannot answer since he has forgotten everything, including his own name. But slowly, through word-association games and Rorschach-style tests, his past begins to reveal itself in sudden, explosive flashes. 
Tantalizing questions are raised. Is he the subject of some demonic brain transplant? Is it all a dream? Or is the psychiatrist a foreign agent intent on prying military secrets out of him? As much as possible, the film remains inside the mind of a character who is desperate for clues to his own identity and who is terrified that he has gone mad. And in its most effective moments, it produces a roller-coaster sense of mental queasiness. 
It is no surprise to learn that Mr. Stahl, who produced, directed and co-wrote "Final Approach," comes from the world of television commercials, for the movie often has the look and sound of an MTV commercial. The entire film is structured as an extended flashback montage with a multi-layered, wraparound sound track.  But for every breathtaking bit of aerial photography there is something correspondingly banal, like the recurrent silhouette of a nude woman diving. And many of the computer-animated effects serve only as slick, superfluous visual filler. 
As is often the case in films this technologically showy, the cinematic pyrotechnics also camouflage gaping holes in a story whose abrupt, unsatisfying conclusion seems borrowed from Albert Brooks's "Defending Your Life." Until that ending, however, the two leading actors play a smooth game of cat and mouse. Mr. Elizondo glides enigmatically along the line between genial and menacing, and Mr. Sikking undergoes a convincing grand mal seizure.  Final Approach

‽Paper Mask‽,‽"Paper Mask," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is the story of a medical fake whose willfulness knows no bounds. Originally a London hospital aide named Matthew Harris (Paul McGann), he takes on the identity of Dr. Simon Hennessey after Hennessey is killed in an accident. He then applies for a job at a hospital in Bristol without benefit of formal medical training, and quickly tries to achieve a minimal level of proficiency by tutoring himself. "I don't know what you see in these skinny women," says one of Matthew's friends when he finds a teaching skeleton hidden in Matthew's bed. 
Bluffing his way into a privileged position -- the camera lingers fondly on perks like "Doctors Only" signs in hospital parking lots -- he does rather well, under the circumstances. Talent and luck are at least as important to Matthew's success as real knowledge would have been. Intuition helps, too; he is able to make a diagnosis of cirrhosis simply by spotting a bottle of liquor hidden in a patient's bed. Also immeasurably helpful is Christine Taylor (Amanda Donohoe), a smart, sexy emergency-ward nurse who seems at least as knowledgeable as most of the doctors working around her. 
In its detailed depiction of hospital life and various medical crises, the generally engrossing "Paper Mask" has an authentic flavor. Written by John Collee, a doctor who is also a novelist and columnist, the screenplay captures the banter and bravado of young doctors, as well as the tension that would make an emergency ward such a nerve-racking place for on-the-job training. As directed by Christopher Morahan, whose credits include "Jewel in the Crown" for Grenada Television and the very funny film "Clockwise," "Paper Mask" moves briskly and does a lot to make its central character's improbable situation seem real. 
But by the end of the story, in an effort to heighten this material's dramatic possibilities, Matthew's compelling mixture of sweetness and ruthlessness becomes unbalanced. Sheer ambition takes precedence, leading him to take deadly measures to hang onto his medical career. And at that point the film becomes too macabre to remain plausible. The story's last moments, however diabolical, are less interesting than the day-by-day details of Matthew's medical charade. 
Mr. McGann, best known as the "I" of "Withnail and I," does a lot to make Matthew appealing, even when he is seen flushing a wristwatch engraved "Love Mom and Dad" down a toilet to dispose of his old identity. Mr. McGann so ably captures Matthew's opportunistic charm that it becomes difficult to dislike him, even when he turns out to be evil incarnate. Ms. Donohoe gives a lively, game performance and manages to look slinky even while wearing sensible shoes. Production notes point out that she has never had any interest in being a nurse. 
Also in the film's solid cast of stage-trained actors are Tom Wilkinson and Frederick Treves as two senior doctors with reason to suspect the competence of "Dr. Hennessey," and Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Mr. Treves's kindly, devoted wife. Ms. Leigh-Hunt, who may be vividly remembered as a strangler's victim in Alfred Hitchcock's "Frenzy," doesn't fare much better this time around. 
"Paper Mask" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some gore, partial nudity and sexual situations.

‽Close My Eyes‽,‽Contemporary London, as depicted in Stephen Poliakoff's "Close My Eyes," is gripped by a feverish malaise. Construction cranes scar the skyline for as far as the eye can see, and the weather is so hot that people have begun to mutter about the end of the world. There is also grim talk about the AIDS epidemic. And when one of the characters makes a date in the sleazier part of town, his first stop is at a vending machine dispensing condoms. 
In this parched, overheated atmosphere, an incestuous affair between Natalie (Saskia Reeves), a restless young woman who drifts from job to job, and her slightly younger brother Richard (Clive Owen) almost makes sense. In a world where nature seems to have slipped out of balance, it is a way of unconsciously affirming the general state of disorder. 
"Close My Eyes," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, begins with a sequence of flashbacks that reveal Natalie and Richard to be smart, attractive people who have drifted for years without a guiding focus. Natalie has always flirted recklessly with her brother, and one day a lingering kiss precipitates a ravenous mutual passion. 
Complicating matters is the fact that Natalie has finally settled down with someone. Her husband, Sinclair (Alan Rickman), an heir to a margarine fortune, is a garrulous businessman who lives in a magnificent riverside mansion and works, as he puts it, in "trends and analysis." Although Natalie and Richard fight against their attraction, it proves overwhelming. And in their clandestine rendezvous they tear at each other with the frenzy of wild animals. When Natalie finally decides to end the affair, Richard, who has given himself over completely to the relationship, begins to come apart, and an undercurrent of violence rises to the surface. 
Mr. Poliakoff, a prolific English playwright whose dramas "Shout Across the River" and "American Days" have both had New York productions, has given his story a theatrical structure whose metaphors clunk a bit too heavily for the machinery not to seem overexposed. Yet the characters in the film's central triangle are drawn with an extraordinary depth and subtlety. Natalie, though beautiful and possessed of an aristocratic willfulness, is also shown to be socially and intellectually insecure. And in the company of the voluble Sinclair, who has an opinion about everything that crosses his line of vision, she is reduced to moody silences. 
Richard is a brash, swinging bachelor with a social conscience, who as the affair begins, has taken a job with a regulatory agency that monitors the progress of a gargantuan development touted as "the new Venice." But as community-spirited as he is, he has as little success in forcing the unscrupulous developers to keep their word as he has in reining in his emotions once they have spun out of control. Richard's and Natalie's love scenes, and later their fight scenes, have a visceral energy that seems so spontaneous there are moments when one feels almost embarrassed to be caught watching. 
Best of all is Mr. Rickman's Sinclair, who in a welcome departure from his usually sinister roles, gives the dilettantish husband many layers. Beneath a supercilious facade, he is as vulnerable as Richard. Indeed, one of the film's most striking qualities is its detailed observation of the ways in which two grown men of very different temperament become emotionally unstrung. 
"Close My Eyes" is an unusually good-looking film. Witold Stok's photography gives the London suburbs a tropical lushness that is appropriate to the situation. And Michael Gibbs's throbbing semi-classical score helps keep the film's heated atmosphere well above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 
"Close My Eyes" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes explicit sex and nudity. Close My Eyes

‽Daughters of the Dust‽,‽Julie Dash's "Daughters of the Dust" is a film of spellbinding visual beauty about the Gullah people living on the Sea Islands off the South Carolina-Georgia coast at the turn of the century. More than any other group of Americans descended from West Africans, the Gullahs, through their isolation, were able to maintain African customs and rituals. Cut off from the mainland, except by boat, they had their own patois: predominantly English but with a strong West African intonation. Most of the film's dialogue is spoken in that dialect, called Geechee, with occasional subtitles in English. 
"Daughters of the Dust," which opened yesterday at Film Forum 1, focuses on the psychic and spiritual conflicts among the women of the Peazant family, a Gullah clan that makes the painful decision to migrate to the American mainland. Set on a summer day in 1902, on the eve of their departure, the film depicts an extended family picnic that is also a ritual farewell celebration attended by a photographer. 
Each of the principal characters represents a different view of a family heritage that, once the Peazants have dispersed throughout the North, may not survive. Nana Peazant (Cora Lee Day), the group's 88-year-old great-grandmother and the clan's closest link to its Yoruba roots, still practices ritual magic and grieves over the demise of that tradition. Viola Peazant (Cherly Lynn Bruce) is a devout Baptist who has rejected Nana's spiritualism but who brings to her Christianity a similar fervency. Haagar (Kaycee Moore), who married into the family, disparages its African heritage as "hoodoo" and eagerly anticipates assimilation into America's middle class. Yellow Mary (Barbara-O), who has returned for the celebration, is the family pariah, shunned by the other women for being a prostitute. 
The most volatile conflict is between Nana's granddaughter, Eula (Alva Rogers), who is pregnant, and her husband, Eli (Adisa Anderson), who believes the father of the child she is carrying is a white rapist. Through a ritual conducted by Nana, Eli eventually realizes that he is the father of the unborn daughter who serves as the film's occasional offscreen narrator. 
Because the characters and their stories are not defined in conventional film-making terms, they are not always easy to follow. The stories, instead of being related in bite-size dramatic chunks, gradually emerge out of a broad weave in which the fabric of daily life, from food preparation to ritualized remembrance, is ultimately more significant than any of the psychological conflicts that surface. 
With a running time of nearly two hours, "Daughters of the Dust" is a very languidly paced film that frequently stops in its tracks simply to contemplate the wild beauty of the Sea Island landscape. Even though the heat, insects and threat of yellow fever made the islands inhospitable to white settlement, the movie still portrays that environment, drenched in sea mist and strewn with palms, as a semi-tropical paradise and the Peazants as a blessed tribe whose independence and harmony with nature partly offsets the scars of having been slaves. 
"Daughters of the Dust," which was made in association with the public broadcasting series "American Playhouse," is the feature film debut of Ms. Dash, who emerges as a strikingly original film maker. For all its harsh allusions to slavery and hardship, the film is an extended, wildly lyrical meditation on the power of African cultural iconography and the spiritual resilience of the generations of women who have been its custodians.  Daughters of the Dust  Written and directed by Julie Dash; director of photography, Arthur Jafa; edited by Amy Carey and Joseph Burton; music by John Barnes; production designer, Kerry Marshall; produced by Ms. Dash and Mr. Jafa; released by Kino International.

‽
‽The Inner Circle‽,‽Just when the Soviet Union is coming apart, it is paradoxical that two films featuring Stalin, the personification of Soviet totalitarianism, should play in New York simultaneously. Stalin is the paranoiac center of gravity in both Andrei Konchalovsky's dark comedy "The Inner Circle," which opened today at the Loews Fine Arts, and in Ken Palmer's "Testimony," at Film Forum 1. In "The Inner Circle," the dictator, played by Aleksandr Zbruyev, is a rotund little demon with twinkling eyes. Terence Rigby's more ominous Stalin, in "Testimony," is a hulking, shadowy beast. 
"The Inner Circle" tells the true story of Ivan Sanshin (Tom Hulce), a movie projectionist for the K.G.B. Club who on his wedding night in 1939 is routed out of his apartment and whisked into the bowels of the Kremlin. Certain he is being arrested for a minor professional mishap, he instead finds himself drafted into the job of personal projectionist for Stalin. His predecessor, he is told, died of a heart attack when yelled at. 
In one of the film's whimsical juxtapositions, the first film Ivan shows the dictator is "The Great Waltz," the glossy Hollywood biography of Johann Strauss and a movie whose giddy spirits seem grotesquely incongruous given the setting. 
Veering unpredictably between comedy and pathos, "The Inner Circle" is a study of prolonged political naivete and its unhappy consequences. Long after it is clear to many in the Soviet Union that Stalin is a tyrant, Ivan remains buffoonishly idolatrous of his boss. In love with his job, he throws himself into his work with the frenzied zeal of a song-and-dance man working up new routines. 
When during an argument with his wife, Anastasiya (Lolita Davidovich), she asks whom he loves more, her or Stalin, he replies, "Stalin," as if no other answer could possibly be imagined. Even after German bombs have reduced his Moscow neighborhood to rubble, he remains stubbornly worshipful. 
Anastasiya, who is more naive than her husband, is emotionally unstable. She fixates her affections on the orphaned daughter of neighbors who were purged by the K.G.B. and, without telling her husband, secretly visits the little girl in the orphanage. Later, when Ivan and Anastasiya accompany Stalin and his entourage on a trip to the Ural Mountains, she lacks the wherewithal to resist the advances of the K.B.G. chief, Lavrenti P. Beria (Bob Hoskins), and her life goes into a tailspin. 
"The Inner Circle" takes a remarkably lighthearted view of a world in which mortal terror pervades the most everyday interpersonal transactions. Lest they be overheard by spying neighbors, Ivan and Anatasiya bundle themselves into a wardrobe to conduct a serious conversation. The scenes in which Stalin engages a quiveringly frightened Ivan in conversation are played with an undercurrent of farce. 
This air of detached gallows humor is augmented by the use of occasional snippets of narration to push the story forward and by some vaguely surreal touches, including the view from Ivan's apartment window showing cattle moving through a cityscape flecked with impossibly large drifting snowflakes. The seriocomic tone is sustained for so long that when the mood of the film suddenly turns darker and more emotional, one has to make a sudden adjustment. 
Yet the film's odd shift from wryness to pathos works to its advantage. One never feels manipulated. And Mr. Hulce, who adopts a serviceable Russian accent for the role, makes the dutiful Ivan a complex character who is alternately maddening and engaging. 
"The Inner Circle is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild sexual scenes. The Inner Circle Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky; written by Mr. Konchalovsky and Anatoly Usov; director of photography, Ennio Guarnieri; edited by Henry Richardson; music by Eduard Artemyev; production designer, Ezio Frigerio; produced by Claudio Bonivento; released by Columbia Pictures.

‽The Prince of Tides‽,‽Nothing about Barbra Streisand's previous acting or direction is preparation for her expert handling of "The Prince of Tides," which has been pared down from Pat Conroy's sprawling, hyperbolic novel to a film that is gratifyingly lean. Discretion and reserve are not the first qualities that come to mind about Ms. Streisand's work, yet they are very much in evidence this time. So is the frankly emotional style with which she is more often associated, a style perfectly attuned to this film's complex, stirring story. "The Prince of Tides" marks Ms. Streisand's triumphantly good job of locating that story's salient elements and making them come alive on the screen. 
Everything about Mr. Conroy's overripe family saga is suffused with excess, from the author's descriptions of his characters ("The words of her poems were a most private and fragrant orchard," he writes of Savannah Wingo, the narrator Tom Wingo's twin sister) to the experiences those characters share. The three Wingo children, Luke, Savannah and Tom, seem to do everything in unison, often on what are either the very best or very worst days of their lives. Feisty, brave and endlessly self-dramatizing, they have the knack of being colorful to a fault. 
Their mother, Lila, who raised them idyllically on a South Carolina sea island, was both the most soothing and the most treacherous parent in the world. The island itself was Paradise, then Paradise Lost. Their abusive father, Henry, cast a giant shadow over his children's lives. All of the Wingos' personal dramas are played out on this exhaustingly grand scale. 
"The Prince of Tides" centers on the adult Tom's efforts to overcome the effects of his painful childhood and come to terms with the various women in his life. These are Lila (Kate Nelligan), now a brittle, wealthy matron; Sallie (Blythe Danner), the wife experiencing the full brunt of Tom's unhappiness; Savannah (Melinda Dillon), now a suicidally depressed New Yorker, and Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Ms. Streisand), Savannah's psychiatrist, who enlists Tom's help in treating Savannah and winds up getting to the heart of Tom's troubles, too. 
One of the best things Ms. Streisand has done here is to get out of the way, so her portrayal of Dr. Lowenstein never upstages Nick Nolte's superlative Tom. "The Prince of Tides" must be Tom's story if it is to have any center, and so Ms. Streisand mostly confines herself to the role of a clever, attractive, authoritative figure on the sidelines. Later on, when Tom and the doctor do become romantically involved, the film takes on a few gooey overtones, what with a too-picturesque weekend in the country, a roaring fire and so on. But by and large it does a remarkable job of maintaining its intelligence and dignity. 
As envisioned by Mr. Conroy, Dr. Lowenstein's attempts to treat Tom have a coy, flirtatious ring and do a lot to undermine her professionalism.  Ms. Streisand's smarter, more composed version of this character is only one of her film's notable improvements upon the novel. The screenplay, by Mr. Conroy and Becky Johnston, consistently extracts the book's best lines of dialogue and leaves the rest behind. The book may have the feel of an overwrought, melodramatic movie, but the film itself does not. 
Long, tedious anecdotes about the Wingos' colorful exploits have been compressed into brief snippets from home movies or else simply removed.  (Happily, the pet tiger that plays a role in Mr. Conroy's most traumatic episode is just about gone.) The novel's big revelations have been given different weight here, and in the film's version they make more sense.  Ms. Streisand makes some especially skillful transitions in juxtaposing Tom's present and past for the audience, just as they are connected in the character's own mind. 
A lot of attention has gone into keeping up both stars' appearances, and their sleek good looks give the film a romantic spirit it might otherwise lack. Ms. Streisand looks quietly, unobtrusively elegant, as do the sets representing her home and office.  And Mr. Nolte comes atypically close to matinee idol status with this role.  The fact that his hair has never looked quite so blond or so glossy should not detract from the fire, urgency and flawless timing that shape his performance. Mr. Nolte is every bit as good while engaging in wrenching therapeutic sessions with Dr. Lowenstein as he is in declaring in a restaurant: "God, there's nothin' sexier than a beautiful woman orderin' food in French. Now I want you to read me the whole menu." 
"The Prince of Tides" has been particularly well cast, with several strongly appealing actresses in minor roles. Ms. Dillon has little to do but look traumatized; however, Ms. Danner and especially Ms. Nelligan add substantially to the film's vivid sense of Tom's life. Jeroen Krabbe plays the story's least plausible character, the world-famous violinist unhappily married to Dr. Lowenstein, and still manages to give the role some panache. Notably good also is Jason Gould, who plays Ms. Streisand's son and very obviously    is    her son, in both appearance and manner.  Mr. Gould makes this unhappy teen-ager a worthwhile part of the film's overall equation instead of the fifth wheel he easily could have been. 
Contributing to the lavish tone of "The Prince of Tides" are James Newton Howard's swelling score and Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography, which visually captures the long-lost glow of childhood implicit in the story. 
"The Prince of Tides" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity, sexual suggestiveness and one episode of violent sexual assault.

‽Until the End of the World‽,‽When it comes to making movies, Wim Wenders is not your average wild and crazy guy. Antic fun for its own sake is not something for which he is known. The German-born director's more recent films ("Wings of Desire," "Paris, Texas," "Hammett") have been schematic and dour, with hard surfaces encasing centers as soft as chocolate-covered cherries. 
For much of its nearly three-hour running time, "Until the End of the World" is something else, a daffy, eccentric road movie that pursues its own inscrutable lighthearted logic through 15 cities in 8 countries on 4 continents. 
"Until the End of the World" has less to do with Mr. Wenders's own early road movies, "Alice in the Cities" and "Kings of the Road," than it does with the kind of elegantly slap-dash improvisations that Jean-Luc Godard once made with (and for) the incomparable Anna Karina. Though it is set in 1999, the movie looks like a mint-condition artifact of the 1960's. 
As the film opens, a narrator informs us that an Indian nuclear satellite has swung out of orbit and threatens to crash to earth to destroy all life. The rest of the world is in a panic but, the narrator goes on, "Claire couldn't care less." 
Claire (Solveig Dommartin), who sometimes wears a black wig that emphasizes her resemblance to the young Anna Karina, is waking up in a strange place, as has been her habit of late, this time at a chicly decadent party in Venice. On the drive back to Paris, Claire becomes the willing bag lady for a pair of loutish but gentle thieves who have just robbed a bank in Nice. 
She agrees to transport the loot to Paris in exchange for a one-third cut. She then picks up Sam Farber (William Hurt), an American on the run, though from whom or what Claire doesn't know. Again she couldn't care less. She's attracted to Sam for his sad eyes and his taste in music, an audio tape of songs sung by pygmy children in Cameroon. 
Claire's patience is tried when Sam makes off with a large part of her money. She tells her lover, Gene (Sam Neill), a novelist based in Paris and a man whose patience is inexhaustible, that she's going after Sam. 
In this fashion the chase begins: Sam, followed by Claire, followed by a bounty hunter (Sam is said to be involved in industrial espionage), a private detective, the bank robbers and Gene, who wants to protect Claire and who, in passing, provides the film's narration. Money for travel arrangements never seems to be a problem. By 1999, the recession is clearly over. 
The trail leads from Paris to Lisbon, Berlin, Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo and San Francisco. It finally ends with all the characters in the Australian outback, where what amounts to another movie begins. This one involves Sam's father, Henry (Max von Sydow), a brilliant scientist, and Sam's blind mother, Edith (Jeanne Moreau). 
In his underground laboratory, Henry has been perfecting a camera that will allow the blind to see. It records the impulses of a brain when it contemplates an image, then feeds those impulses into the brain of the blind person, providing the equivalent to sight. More than that, though, it's a device for "sucking out the dreams" of almost anybody. 
It is one of Mr. Wenders's more comic conceits that Claire and the others who participate in the doctor's experiments quickly become dangerously addicted to the taped images of their dreams. They lie listlessly about the outback all day, not eating or tending to fundamental hygiene. Instead they either dream of dreams or watch those dreams on portable video monitors. 
Each addict isolates himself from the others. It's the video age as a real-life nightmare. Time and the world of commonplace responsibilities have come to a halt. Only Gene continues to believe "in the magic and the healing power of the word." 
There's much more to the movie, not all of it logical, much of it absurd and some of it (the last sequence, for example) funnier than even Mr. Wenders may know. The film's center is characteristically squashy. 
What is appealing about "Until the End of the World" is its looseness. It appears to be composed of musiclike riffs, and with the exception of Mr. von Sydow and Miss Moreau, nobody seems to take it too seriously until the name of Greenpeace is mentioned. As often happens with Mr. Wenders, it's not always possible to tell whether he knows when he's gone over the edge. 
The members of the cast are attractive and, above all, game. Shooting the film in so many far-flung locations in such a short time must have been its own nightmare. The futuristic gadgetry is kept modest in scale so the actors never have to battle the special effects. 
"Until the End of the World" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some vulgar language.

‽Father of the Bride‽,‽Vincente Minnelli's 1950 "Father of the Bride" is an affectionate reminder of the days when parties required stiff protocol, suburban life was martini-filled and gracious, a majority of one's college classmates were likely to be married and a father was truly a patriarch, valiantly meeting the fiscal and emotional needs of everyone in his household. It's an antique with a story that doesn't quite track in a world where Mother runs a business and Daddy's little girl plays basketball. 
But "Father of the Bride" has been charmingly if improbably remade, with Steve Martin as the embattled father who suffers new indignities at each stage of his daughter's wedding plans. Mr. Martin, following in the very large footsteps of Spencer Tracy, is meant to be a sturdy, house-proud businessman and the long-married, devoted father of a 22-year-old daughter. He's not believable in any of these capacities, but he can be very funny, especially when the director, Charles Shyer, gives him room to depart from Tracy's indelible performance and make the role his own. 
Mr. Martin, whose presence here probably has more to do with his success in "Parenthood" than anything else, is first seen sitting in an armchair exactly as Tracy did, rubbing his sore feet and surveying the ruins of an extravagant wedding party. The film then flashes back to the point at which George Banks (Mr. Martin) and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), learned that their little Annie (Kimberly Williams) may be leaving the nest. 
The nest itself has moved to southern California from a starchier East Coast setting and is now conspicuously cluttered and brand-new. There's nothing about it that looks lived in, which is in keeping with the remake's artificial flavor. Still, this house becomes an interesting echo of the earlier film's exaggeratedly gracious setting. This "Father of the Bride" is filled with evidence of how the idealized vision of American family life has changed in the last 40 years, from the fact that the cost of throwing the wedding has multiplied by nearly a hundredfold to the absence of alcohol-related humor, which was a big staple of the earlier version. 
This time, when the Bankses go to meet their wealthy prospective in-laws, George doesn't drink too much and talk their ears off, as Tracy did. He experiences a sudden fit of nosiness and winds up floating in his hosts' pool, clutching their bankbook while being snarled at by their guard dogs, in a routine that is much better suited to Mr. Martin's comic talents. 
Some of the new film's other efforts to broaden the story are less successful, like the episode that has George going berserk in a grocery store and winding up in jail as a consequence of pre-wedding pressure. As for the wedding itself, it turns out to be overlong and anticlimactic, and it tries too hard to draw tears. The new film contains a lot more sentimental heart-to-heart talks than the earlier one did. 
Mr. Martin is always the comic centerpiece of "Father of the Bride," while Ms. Keaton has been given a matronly role and much less to do. Ms. Williams, who must compete with the memory of a radiant young Elizabeth Taylor in the bride's role, does a spirited job of making the character more modern. (Ms. Taylor's most memorable line, cooing to her father about her husband-to-be's occupation: "Well, I don't know, Pops, he makes something. Does it really matter what it is?") 
Kieran Culkin, playing the bride's little brother, has the same scene-stealing confidence his older brother Macaulay does. Also in the film are B. D. Wong and Martin Short as a pair of wedding consultants who are too flouncy to be entirely funny. Mr. Short, with a fussy coiffure and an indecipherable accent (he says "kek" for "cake"), strongly recalls Bronson Pinchot's hilariously bizarre art-gallery assistant in "Beverly Hills Cop." 
The screenplay, credited to Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, Nancy Meyers and Mr. Shyer, represents recycling at its best. The material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film's most memorable moments have been preserved. One of these finds Mr. Martin struggling to squeeze into his old suit of formal clothes just as Tracy did, although in Mr. Martin's case it's a tuxedo with a ruffled shirt, circa 1975; Tracy wore a cutaway with top hat and tails. That's the difference between the first, formal "Father of the Bride" and the new one, in which condoms and seat belts and running shoes are part of the world. 
"Father of the Bride" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity.

‽
‽Bugsy‽,‽Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel, a true gangster Gatsby, arrived in Hollywood with a heart full of promise and a gleam in his eye. Recklessly romantic, he brought with him the first glimmer of "a Garden of Eden in the desert": a brand-new resort that would provide organized crime with a political toehold, as well as a place that would outdo even the movie capital in terms of glitter, garishness and license to indulge any whim. 
Some regard the American Dream as an expression of our best vision of ourselves. Others, like the makers of the sleek, funny, vastly entertaining "Bugsy," take a less sentimental view. This film, directed by Barry Levinson and written by James Toback, regards the man who dreamed up Las Vegas as a star-struck pragmatist, a mixture of glamour and cynicism, a visionary who saw the chance to create something very like himself only much, much bigger. "Bugsy" is a smart, seductive portrait of both the man and his monument. The debonair Ben Siegel (who greatly resented any comparison to an insect) would have loved everything about it except its name. 
Warren Beatty, who is one of the film's co-producers, has found the role of his career in this sly, evasive schemer with the manipulative instincts of a born ladies' man. When an actor as skillful as Mr. Beatty has essentially only one character in his repertory, he can indeed be glad to find that character as fully realized as Ben Siegel is here. His antecedents, in films like "Shampoo" and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," had a similar diffident charm and a similar awareness of their own failings, but Ben Siegel is much more dangerous and vital. If this self-styled "sportsman" had not existed, Mr. Beatty would have had to make him up. 
Actually, "Bugsy" does make up its hero to a certain degree. The film's rosy portrait avoids such matters as Bugsy's involvement in drug smuggling, not to mention the long, shady career enjoyed by Virginia Hill, Bugsy's lover (and by some accounts his wife), after Bugsy's messy demise. Although "Bugsy" includes deft characterizations of such mobsters as Meyer Lansky (played dryly by Ben Kingsley) and Lucky Luciano (the late Bill Graham), the film greatly understates the gangland aspects of its story. No Tommy guns here: instead, the silken "Bugsy" is filled with gold lame evening gowns, clever repartee, strawberries and Champagne. It's fitting that Ben Siegel's infatuation with the swankiest of Hollywood elegance has been incorporated into his own story. 
Directing "Bugsy" with both the requisite sweep and a welcome touch of the sardonic, Mr. Levinson begins his story at a crucial juncture in Ben Siegel's life: when this Brooklyn-born killer bade farewell to his New York origins and headed west to reinvent himself in more cinematic terms. A witty prelude establishes Ben as a flirt, a clothes horse and a tease, a man capable of presenting an expensive "shirt off my back" to someone he will murder only seconds later. In Los Angeles, where he is met at a beautifully evoked Union Station by his childhood friend George Raft (Joe Mantegna), these attributes quickly take on an aspect of the dramatic, especially when coupled with Ben's natural flair. "Gangster or Star?" a newspaper headline asks about this new arrival, early in his stay. 
Definitely a star, at least as far as "Bugsy" is concerned. The film devises a great many intoxicatingly grand gestures for its hero, including the way he first glimpses Virginia Hill across a crowded Raft movie set and simply falls into step beside her.  "May I?" he asks, seeing Virginia with an unlit cigarette. "If you want a simple yes or no you're going to have to finish the question," she replies.  The encounter instantly establishes Virginia as a match for this tough guy, and ends quite magically as the two stand atop a little hill, by a fake rustic bus stop on the movie set, extravagantly overdressed and enjoying each another's talent for backtalk. 
In this regard, Mr. Toback's screenplay is one of the film's happiest surprises. The overheated style of his own films (among them "Fingers" and "Exposed") is apparent in the dialogue, and in such episodes as Bugsy's violently humiliating another man, then feeling ravenously hungry afterward (while Virginia finds herself sexually stimulated by Bugsy's mean streak). But Mr. Levinson's direction is so adroit and wry that such moments lose their potential for excess. Thus muted, the bravado of Mr. Toback's language becomes crisply effective, as when the widely experienced Virginia tells Ben that she's been nothing but trouble for all of the many men she knew before him. "Good," Ben answers. "That's what they get for trying to steal my girl." 
As Virginia, Annette Bening provides "Bugsy" will all the heat and chemistry that Mr. Beatty's "Dick Tracy" lacked, sauntering through her role with a sexy abandon that greatly enhances the film's allure.  Only later, when Virginia becomes a pivotal figure in Ben's plans to construct a hotel (named the Flamingo, in honor of the long-legged Virginia), does Ms. Bening seem less hard-boiled, complex or changeable than the woman she plays. 
"Bugsy" pales a bit in these later sections as a consequence of its having come on like gangbusters in its opening hour. Everything the audience needs to know about Ben and Virginia is established early, and Ben himself is not fundamentally changed by the events of the story. This is limiting, but it would be more of a problem if the film's sumptuous look and Mr. Beatty's performance were not so captivating on their own. 
Also in "Bugsy" are Harvey Keitel, outstandingly blunt and funny as the gangster Mickey Cohen ("You would-be smoothie!" he shouts at Bugsy); the director Richard Sarafian as one of Ben's early henchmen; Bebe Neuwirth as the Countess Dorothy di Frasso, who Ben grandly hoped would introduce him to Benito Mussolini so Ben could personally shorten World War II, and Elliott Gould as the sad-sack childhood friend whom Ben eventually executes for business reasons. Typically, the film turns this into a solitary lethal act of Bugsy's when it was more likely the work of a three-man team. 
Allen Daviau's camera work and Albert Wolsky's costumes help to forge the film's high style, as does Ennio Morricone's score. But much of its elan comes from Mr. Levinson's obvious affection for the time and place that are his film's backdrop, and from the flair with which he stages even minor episodes, like the montage showing how Ben sells 900 percent of his shares in the Flamingo in order to finance his plan. Another memorable sequence shows Ben and Virginia slinking gracefully back and forth past a movie screen, changing from full figures to silhouettes as they stalk each another. 
Only occasionally, in a sequence that shows Ben racing from gangsters to the telephone to his unhappy family on his daughter's birthday, and wearing a chef's headgear all the while, does the film's style appear overly antic. Most of the time, its spirit is captured by the strains of "Accentuate the Positive" heard tootling in the background, and by Meyer Lansky's last words on Bugsy Siegel and Las Vegas: "He isn't even interested in money. He's interested in the idea." 
"Bugsy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual suggestiveness, violence and strong language.

‽The Last Boy Scout‽,‽The best thing about Tony Scott's "Last Boy Scout" is the title, which refers to Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis), a once-exemplary Secret Service agent who wore black suits, white shirts and narrow ties, who shaved each morning and who, in his finest moment, saved the life of a United States President. 
Today Joe is history. He's a burned-out case. He is a shabby Los Angeles private eye who sleeps off his hangovers in his beat-up car. In addition to nicotine, he is hopelessly addicted to one-liners. When Mr. Big, who is about to sic his goons on Joe, says that he would like, just once, to hear Joe scream, the response is a fast, "Play some rap music." 
They don't make men like Joe anymore, but they do make screenplays like Shane Black's for "The Last Boy Scout." These would include "Lethal Weapon," for which Mr. Black wrote the screenplay, and "Lethal Weapon II," for which he wrote the first draft. 
"The Last Boy Scout" is supposed to be a homage to the tough-guy detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler; yet it plays more like a retread of the "Lethal Weapon" movies. The only things changed are the actors, the names of the characters and their professions. 
Mr. Willis plays what is, in effect, the Mel Gibson role, though not quite as entertainingly maniacal. Damon Wayans takes over for Danny Glover of "Lethal Weapon" in a role that has been somewhat refurbished but remains essentially a voice of reason. He is Jimmy Dix, a former pro football star who, like Joe, is on the skids. 
Joe's downward spiral began when a United States Senator had him fired from the service. Jimmy turned to cocaine when his wife, eight months' pregnant, was killed by a van that jumped the curb. 
In Mr. Black's macho oeuvre, women either don't live long or do live badly. Joe has a wife, Sarah (Chelsea Field), but she cheats on him. He also has a 13-year-old daughter, Darian (Danielle Harris), who wears too much makeup and talks dirty. No matter that the movie acknowledges that Joe is to blame for his domestic problems. His true helpmate is Jimmy Dix. 
"The Last Boy Scout" is about the ruthless attempt of the owner of a pro football team, called the Los Angeles Stallions, to secure senatorial backing for a bill to legalize gambling on sports. It's a story that, in other hands, might have made a good, tough, old-fashioned private-eye thriller. 
Instead, Mr. Scott and Mr. Black have concocted another exercise in mechanical sleaze, in which narrative coherence is sacrificed on behalf of pyrotechnical special effects, mostly involving transport. When automobiles are not crashing, going over embankments or being blown up (the film's favorite mode of distressing a car), someone falls atop the rotors of a helicopter in mid-air. The body count is high. 
Mr. Willis and Mr. Wayans have each demonstrated a knack for irreverent comedy in other vehicles -- Mr. Willis in "Moonlighting" on television and in the "Die Hard" movies, Mr. Wayans on television as a regular member of the cast of "In Living Color." Yet they don't play very well together. 
Joe and Jimmy meet cute and fight, then join forces to make Los Angeles safe for pro football. Their bonhomie seems forced, like the snappiness of the dialogue. 
Mr. Scott ("Top Gun," "Days of Thunder") directs the film as if he were trying to win a prize for demolishing a building in record time. The opening is good: stylish video images of a night football game played in a torrential rain, climaxed by the only scene in the film that has legitimate shock. After that, the brutality and the pace don't slacken, but interest does. 
The best thing in the film is Halle Berry ("Jungle Fever," "Strictly Business"), an actress who is going places. She appears briefly as cocktail waitress and stripper. 
The news is not all bad for Mr. Willis. "The Last Boy Scout" is better than "Hudson Hawk."

‽
‽Hook‽,‽Now we know: if Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky had been less power-driven and more in touch with the child within, Wall Street would have been spared a great scandal and each man a prison term. 
That is the balmy subtext of "Hook," Steven Spielberg's gargantuan, very long screen update on James M. Barrie's 1904 play, "Peter Pan," and the subsequent Barrie stories about the little boy who refused to grow up. The film is a Wall Street-size financial gamble in itself. 
"Hook" cost a mint, and it shows.  To be profitable, it must be all things to as many people as possible, including kids who can identify with a 40-year-old man in a midlife crisis, and 40-year-old men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses. 
The film is too much; yet the charm of the Barrie original has not been entirely lost. 
"Hook" has a hugely funny bravura performance by Dustin Hoffman as the vain, vile and none-too-effective Captain Hook. Wearing a large black wig in the style of England's unfortunate Charles I, Mr. Hoffman's Hook preens, walks with a dainty step, loses his temper easily and tries very hard to be bad. 
Equally comic is Bob Hoskins who plays Smee, Hook's smarmy aide-de-camp and, often, his brains. This cockney Smee belongs to the great theatrical tradition of wily menservants who, like Moliere's Scapin, are their masters' masters. 
As Hook is racking his brains to come up with a plan to destroy Peter Pan, Smee exclaims, "I think I'm having an apostrophe!" Says Hook, "I think you mean epiphany." The plan is, in fact, a clever one. 
Smee gets the words wrong and Hook is short on invention. Neither character has been tampered with to conform to late-20th-century sensibilities. 
The other casting is also good. As the middle-aged Peter Pan, Robin Williams doesn't look entirely comfortable when he must wear the green shorts better suited to Mary Martin, but he plays the role as legitimately as possible. Julia Roberts (Tinkerbell) goes through most of the film appearing to be about seven inches tall. Even at that size, she's a sweet, light, laughing presence. 
Yet "Hook" is overwhelmed by a screenplay heavy with complicated exposition, by what are, in effect, big busy nonsinging, nondancing production numbers and some contemporary cant about rearing children and the high price paid for success. The acute difficulty of having it all may be of greater urgency to Mr. Spielberg than to most of the people who will see the movie. 
"Hook" is less a sequel to "Peter Pan" than a variation on it. Its conceit is that, some years after the adventures described in "Peter Pan," Peter returned from Never-Never Land to London to see his adored Wendy and fell in love with Moira, the aging Wendy's granddaughter. To be able to consummate his love, he agreed to grow up. 
When "Hook" begins, Peter, now called Peter Banning, is a frenetic, hard-driving mergers-and-acquisitions wizard living in Southern California with Moira and their two children. In his climb to the top, he has lost touch with his true self. He's so absorbed by business that he misses his 11-year-old son's most important baseball game. 
Peter has completely forgotten his earlier incarnation, which is probably just as well for his career. Not many high rollers would entrust the fate of an unfriendly corporate takeover to a fellow who has a pal named Tinkerbell and as a mortal enemy a sword-buckled pirate with a hook for a hand. 
When the Banning family makes a trip to London to see the 90-year-old Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith), Peter's children are kidnapped by the vengeful Hook and taken off to Never-Never Land. There is nothing to do but go in pursuit, at which point (somewhat late) the movie really begins. 
What follows is an elaborate, thoroughly Americanized version of the Barrie play, reworked so that more time is devoted to teaching Peter how to dream and fly again than to his combat with Hook. Barrie's Lost Boys, once Peter Pan's charges, now inhabit a forest paradise equipped with basketball hoops and ramps for skateboards. 
The kids appear to be mostly refugees from today's urban society. They have the style of children of the television age. They indulge in cheerless food fights and their language is sitcom wise, prematurely hip. They seem to be less permanently lost than on a two-week vacation at summer camp. 
Their re-education of Peter may amuse very young patrons, but they aren't an especially funny or engaging crew. The movie picks up when Peter at long last takes to the air. Mr. Williams flies well. Yet he has a problem that no legitimate theater Peter Pan faces. 
When an actor onstage goes swooping aloft, even though carried by wires never entirely invisible, the audience is as much mesmerized by the mechanics of the stunt (and the thought of what might happen, heaven forbid) as by the flying's import to the play. 
Because anything can be done in a movie, the flying has less emotional impact. Special effects today are commonplace. 
The sequences set in the pirate's cove and aboard the pirate ship, the Jolly Roger (which never leaves the dock), are somewhat more entertaining, but the movie's obviously expensive scale inhibits the fun instead of enhancing it. 
The pirates' cove is a major movie set. As seen in long shots, it looks like something from the imagination of an uncharacteristically winsome Hieronymus Bosch. The ambers, reds, browns and grays are pretty, and the eye is dazzled by the sight of so many extras, each going about a different task. It's only with difficulty that Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Williams dominate so much scenery. It's an exhausting labor. 
In "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Empire of the Sun," Mr. Spielberg demonstrated that he is one of America's most able directors when it comes to handling young actors.  It's a surprise then that, with one exception, the children in "Hook" are so perfunctorily cast and directed. 
Only Charlie Korsmo, the boy who played Kid in "Dick Tracy," is right.  His material is no better than that given the other children, but he has wit and emotional weight as the son whom Peter has neglected. He even holds his own with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Hoskins, in particular, in a baseball game that Hook has arranged to win the boy's affection. 
Mr. Korsmo is a real actor. So, too, are Miss Smith and Caroline Goodall, who plays Moira, though their roles are subsidiary to the decor and the other stars. 
Jim V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo wrote the screenplay from a screen story by Mr. Hart and Nick Castle. The biggest laugh they provide is a lawyer joke. It's probably not the writers' fault that one keeps hearing what sound like song cues, if only because the 1954 "Peter Pan" musical adaptation remains so fresh. 
Perhaps one day Mr. Hoffman will get a chance to sing that show's classic "Captain Hook's Waltz," music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. In the meantime he does very well just acting the role with brilliance, a cappella. 
"Hook," which has been rated PG (Parental guidance suggested), has some mildly scary moments and impolite language. Hook Directed by Steven Spielberg; screenplay by Jim V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo, story by Mr. Hart and Nick Castle; director of photography, Dean Cundey; film editor, Michael Kahn; music by John Williams; production design, Norman Garwood; produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Gerald R.

‽
‽The Double Life of Veronique‽,‽If "The Double Life of Veronique" seems ambiguous now, think about what the director wanted it to be. Krzysztof Kieslowski's original idea was to create several slightly different versions of the film, to play in different theaters. If a viewer saw "Veronique" twice at different places, the story might change like a favorite bedtime story in which a phrase is altered or a scene added or dropped with each telling. There would be no "right" way to see the film. 
The idea was too impractical and expensive to be more than a thought, but the notion suggests the best way to approach the enigmatic story of a Polish woman named Veronika and a French woman named Veronique (both played by Irene Jacob). The two young women look identical, were born at the same time, never meet, yet share some not-quite-conscious affinity. They are and are not the same. Don't even attempt to resolve that paradox, and "The Double Life of Veronique" will work on its own poetic terms. Try to piece the film together like a jigsaw puzzle, try to make it yield some neat message about identity, and nothing will result except frustration. 
"Veronique" has recently started its commerical run after being shown at the Cannes and New York film festivals. If the film is frustrating to many viewers, it is partly because Mr. Kieslowski plays with the jigsaw-puzzle approach, creating too many parallels and coincidences, photographing too many mirrors and reflections in windows. The images are richly beautiful, but the director sometimes seems to be scattering clues and red herrings across two countries and two lives. 
The first section of the film, set in Poland, follows Veronika as she goes to visit her aunt in Cracow, wins a music contest and collapses on stage while singing. Only after her collapse does the film move on, permanently, to Veronique in Paris. She is making love, apparently content. Suddenly she feels sad, "as if I were grieving," she says. She has no conscious idea that Veronika exists, much less that something has happened to her. Still, as if she had been warned, Veronique gives up her own plans for a professional career in music and becomes a teacher. 
But the film's impact does not rely on such clues linking the women; it rests on the poetic images that defy translation and that link them even more firmly than the actual clues. Veronique receives a piece of string in the mail, a mysterious gift from an admirer. It is a sign identifying the man who sent it, a puppeteer and author who has written a children's book about a shoelace. 
To viewers, it is a much less literal sign, one that brings to mind the image of Veronika singing and twisting the tie-string of her music folder around her finger until the string acccidentally snaps off. 
Early in the film, Veronika holds up a small, clear plastic ball with brightly colored stars inside. It is a talisman that she carries in her purse, and as she rides the train to Cracow it reflects the image of a church and the passing landscape, upside down. Veronique dreams of Veronika's landscapes, and carries an identical little ball in her purse. 
Veronique even teaches her class the same choral music that Veronika sings. The piece was composed 200 years ago but discovered only recently, she tells the class. This is another of Mr. Kieslowski's tricks. The music was created by Zbigniew Preisner, who has worked on several other Kieslowski films. 
The composition, brand new, only seems to carry the weight of history, just as the film only seems to carry specific clues about the themes of identity. The string does not have any allegorical meaning; neither does the star-filled plastic ball. "Veronique" is poetic in the truest sense, relying on images that can't be turned into prosaic statements without losing something of their essence. The film suggests mysterious connections of personality and emotion, but it was never meant to yield any neat, summary idea about the two women's lives. 
Viewers are accustomed to much more certainty on screen, though. In fact, the version of "Veronique" now playing has a slightly different ending from the one released in France. There, Veronique goes to visit her father, stops some distance from the house, and puts her hand on a tree -- a tentative, inexplicable image. But after that version was shown at the New York Film Festival this year, Mr. Kieslowski realized that the ambiguity made American audiences uncomfortable. So he added a scene that shows Veronique walking to the house, embracing her father, finally at home with herself and the mystery of her double existence. It is a more soothing conclusion, but it won't alter anyone's opinion of the film. 
Neither would any of the other endings Mr. Kieslowski proposed when he was thinking about the many versions of "Veronique." One would have ended with the puppeteer inventing a story about identical women, a scene that now comes very near the end of the film. Another version would have sent Veronique to Cracow, where she would have caught the eye of a singer who looks almost, but not exactly, like herself and Veronika. These many lives of Veronique would have frustrated some expectations but opened endless poetic possibilities. 
‽
‽Young Soul Rebels‽,‽There are those who remember the summer of 1977, when punk-rock rudely exploded onto the London pop scene, as a shining moment when rock-and-roll briefly became a potent political wedge in British society. Those days when Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols proclaimed "Anarchy in the U.K." are fondly remembered in "Young Soul Rebels," a film by the British black independent film maker Isaac Julien. The movie's injections of racial and sexual politics suggest a crude, low-budget hybrid of "My Beautiful Laundrette" and "Pump Up the Volume." 
Two years ago, Mr. Julien's cinematic meditation on the poet Langston Hughes, "Looking for Langston," was shown at the New York Film Festival and caused a minor furor because of its insistence on Hughes's homosexuality. Mr. Julien's examination of the punk-rock era brings a similar racial and sexual perspective to its portrait of two friends who operate a pirate radio station out of an East End garage. 
An odd couple who have known each other since childhood, Chris (Valentine Nonyela) is mulatto, slightly effeminate and heterosexual, while Caz (Mo Sesay) is black, macho and gay. Each night on their station, Soul Patrol, they broadcast the latest records by Parliament and Funkadelic and other late-1970's funk luminaries. The film's perspective on the halycon days of punk culture is black-oriented. Chris and Caz belong to an exuberant corps of brightly attired soul brothers and sisters who share the streets with spiky-haired punks, disco-hopping gay men and ominously glowering skinheads. The film's social nexus is an interracial, omnisexual dance club called the Crypt. 
One of the many things that the movie, which opens today at the Village East Cinema, also tries to be is a murder mystery. One night while cruising a park, T. J. (Shyro Chung), a close friend of Chris and Caz, is slashed to death. In a plot twist clumsily reminiscent of "Blow-Up," Chris visits the scene of the crime and finds the boom box T. J. was carrying when he was killed, which contains a tape of the killer's voice. It is not long before Chris is arrested for the crime and viciously interrogated by the police. 
"Young Soul Rebels" is at its worst when it is trying to be a whodunit. Early in the movie, it is quite clear who the murderer is. And the moments when the film tries to build suspense are clankingly overdone. At its best, the movie lays bare the schisms in London society in scenes of the local street life, where tensions are often on the verge of erupting into violence. 
The film is also at its most engaging in its portrayal of Chris and Caz as they simultaneously enter new relationships. Chris, who aspires to be a professional disk jockey, becomes involved with a sleek production assistant (Sophie Okonedo) at a commercial radio station. Caz takes up with Billibud (Jason Durr), a white punk who is helping to organize a demonstration against the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebration. The scenes of meeting and courtship capture the awkwardness and the excitement of youthful infatuation with a freshness and zest that avoids the high-gloss cliches of young love, Hollywood-style.

‽At Play in the Fields of the Lord‽,‽"At Play in the Fields of the Lord," Hector Babenco's adaptation of the Peter Matthiessen novel, is a big, melancholy screen adventure, vividly realized in the jungles of Brazil, about people out of touch with one another and at dangerous odds with a primeval world they understand not at all. 
With fidelity to the book, and to the look, sound, heat and wet of the exotic locale, Mr. Babenco evokes the arrogant confusion of a small group of mismatched North Americans, caught in a brutal landscape that overwhelms them even as it's disappearing. Though the movie sometimes has trouble expressing what's on its mind, it is a rare movie in that it has something on its mind to express. 
The principal characters include a pair of mangy bush pilots, Moon (Tom Berenger) and Wolf (Tom Waits), who, low on money and gas, are stranded at a godforsaken jungle outpost, their passports and single-engine plane impounded. Wolf is a profane, hard-drinking urban lout.  Moon is a moody loner, who is also half American Indian. 
Also in the village, staying at the only hotel, are two youngish missionary couples, Leslie and Andy Huben (John Lithgow and Daryl Hannah) and Martin and Hazel Quarrier (Aidan Quinn and Kathy Bates) who, with their small son, have just arrived from the States. 
The Hubens and the Quarriers share an earnest, psalm-singing, fundamentalist Christian faith. They are out to save the savages (Hazel Quarrier's term) from their Stone Age ways and from the Roman Catholic priests who, if they could, would have saved the savages first. 
The screenplay, adapted by Jean-Claude Carriere and Mr. Babenco, tells several stories simultaneously.  It's about Moon's reverse conversion when he leaves civilization's squalid outpost to join the Niarunas, an especially primitive Indian tribe he associates with his own North American people. 
It's also about the missionaries' attempt to set up a jungle church to convert the Niaruna, about the collapse of the courage of one of the missionaries, the loss of faith of another and the madness of a third. "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" doesn't play smoothly, but it often plays well. 
The film's most interesting character, acted by Mr. Quinn with a secretive kind of intelligence, is Martin Quarrier. Trapped in a marriage to a woman of small, unstable mind, Martin would honor both his marriage and his faith and becomes, almost in spite of himself, heroic. 
Unlike the Quarriers' marriage, the Hubens' appears to be a happy one. It seems to be a true union of body, mind and spirit, but then it become apparent that Leslie Huben is the sort of man who is more skillful at public relations and moral compromises than at his work in the field.  Except for the particular crisis that these missionaries must face, the Hubens' marriage would probably have been a long and satisfying one. 
Though the enlightened Martin Quarrier is the center of the film, the character on whom the film rests is Moon, whose search for identity is not dramatized in any convincing way. It isn't just that the movie cannot enter Moon's thoughts. The novel has the same problem, even though Mr. Matthiessen devotes many pages to Moon's drug-induced hallucinations before he makes his big leap to freedom. 
"At Play in the Fields of the Lord" looks sensationally good. There is no faking these jungle locations, whether seen from the air, as Moon's fragile plane flies wanly into a time long past, or on the ground, where the flora can be as malignant as the fauna. A number of individual scenes stand out, including an early bar encounter of the drunken Moon with the naive Martin Quarrier and an amused, patient Catholic priest. 
Says Moon, "If the Lord made Indians the way they are, who are you to make them different?" That is the film's worthy but not exactly novel point. 
The life at the jungle church settlement is richly realized. Yet an important scene, in which the beautiful Andy Huben goes skinny-dipping, seems wildly out of place, if only because Miss Hannah's body looks too magnificent to be entirely true in these circumstances. The scene is essential to everything that happens afterward and is taken directly from the book, but fidelity sometimes backfires. 
Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written.  Miss Bates is splendid as a big, slow, furious and frightened woman, someone who should never have ventured south of Orlando, Fla. Mr. Berenger maintains his self-respect in sequences that often suggest the National Geographic come to life. 
Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism. 
Whatever the reason, "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" leaves one a bit bemused, vaguely worrying about the fate of the rain forests and the ozone layer as the endangered Indians. To this extent, the movie can be said to engage the intellect somewhat more than the emotions. 
"At Play in the Fields of the Lord," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has nudity, violence and vulgar language.

‽
‽Kafka‽,‽Steven Soderbergh's "Kafka" is a very bad well-directed movie. 
The film, the director's first since making his splashy debut with "Sex, Lies and Videotape," opens a one-week engagement today at the Cinema 2 to qualify for the Academy Awards. 
"Kafka" is spectacularly split.  Though it is a dark, atmospheric pastiche suggested by, but not exactly based on, the life and writings of Franz Kafka, it has the blinding optimism of a sophomore who expects his five-page outline for a novel to win a National Book Award. 
At the film's dualist heart is Lem Dobbs's original screenplay. Mr. Dobbs seems to be an enthusiastic if skeptical student of, among other things, "The Trial," "Metamorphosis" and "The Castle," at least he was when the screenplay was written 10 years ago. In the belief that no Kafka novel or short story could easily be transferred to the screen, Mr. Dobbs set out to write his own Kafka-ish work, which he describes as "a fast-paced combination of thrills and comedy." 
The result is the gloomy "Kafka," set in Prague in 1919, about a man named Kafka (Jeremy Irons), a distant relative of such Franz Kafka protagonists as Gregor Samsa, Joseph K. and just plain K. The fictional Kafka slaves away at a dreary job in an insurance claims office by day and, by night, writes novels and stories. 
"What are you working on now?" asks a sculptor of tombstones. "Oh," says Kafka, pleased that anyone should be interested, "a story about a man who wakes up to find himself transformed into a giant insect." 
When a friend disappears, Kafka sets out to search for him, only to become a victim himself. He is pursued by "them," the mostly nameless others, authority figures who represent the office in which he works, the police and even the unseen, unknown figures in the great castle that guards the city below. 
His investigations lead him to the friend's mistress (Theresa Russell) who, in turn, introduces Kafka to a band of bomb-planting anarchists.  Somehow Kafka comes into possession of his own bomb. When the friend's body turns up in the river, the police call it a suicide, which Kafka thinks unlikely. 
The answers to these questions, Kafka knows, are in the castle. He vows to enter it, though no one has ever gone there and come out alive.  It's at this point that Kafka meets Indiana Jones, if not in fact or style, at least in spirit. 
By adding coherence and what might be called rational evil to the Kafka-ish situation, Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Soderbergh have somehow eliminated all sense of menace from the movie. One fools around with Franz Kafka's lucid prose and dread visions at one's own peril. 
"Kafka" is opaque without ever being mysterious, frightening or suggestive of anything but movie making. Its chases through dark narrow streets don't create suspense, since nothing is at stake. Kafka is no less a cipher than those representatives of the forces that would destroy him. 
It's not giving anything away to report that the movie does close on a Kafka-ish note, but it comes too late to have meaning. The same is true of the single cough that Mr. Irons suddenly coughs toward the end of the movie, a dutiful reminder of how the real Franz K. died in 1924. 
The screenplay is a mess, but Mr. Soderbergh's handling of it is not at all bad. He demonstrates the kind of unflappable facility with which such old-time studio directors as Michael Curtiz and George Marshall once approached every second-rate assignment. 
Though "Kafka" bears no resemblance to "Sex, Lies and Videotape," which was written by Mr. Soderbergh and is a contemporary comedy of real wit, the director treats the material as if it were the real thing, that is, something by Franz K. The movie, which was shot largely in Prague, looks good. 
Walt Lloyd's black-and-white cinematography recalls not only the German Expressionist cinema but also the work of Orson Welles, in particular Welles's 1963 adaptation of "The Trial," filmed in Paris's abandoned Gare d'Orsay. Whether consciously or not, Gavin Bocquet, the production designer, evokes that Belle Epoque railroad station in his set for the anarchists' headquarters. 
Alec Guinness, Ian Holm, Ms. Russell, Joel Grey, Armin Mueller-Stahl and the other members of the supporting cast underplay their roles with notable self-effacement. Carrying the film from start to finish is Mr. Irons, who is far darker, more intense and more latently tubercular than the screenplay ever indicates. 
"Kafka," which is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), would probably put a child to sleep long before a possibly scary sequence at the climax, one in which people are seen being fatally annoyed in a laboratory worthy of the mad old Dr. Frankenstein.

‽
‽My Girl‽,‽Here are two notable facts about Macaulay Culkin, currently America's youngest movie star. One: his voice is changing, since he's now 11 years old. And two: he plays nothing more than a supporting role in "My Girl," even though the surprise success of "Home Alone" (which was released before this film began shooting) owed so much to his natural comic talent and his flair for the double-take shriek. Expecting this funny, unaffected young actor to spend most of his time on the sidelines, as the makers of "My Girl" do, is a little like trying to defy gravity -- and just about as smart. 
Mr. Culkin is not even the "my" in "My Girl," since the film is chiefly about the girl herself. She is Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky), and the film's case of the cutes extends well beyond that name. Vada's father, Harry (Dan Aykroyd), is a playful mortician who kids around in the embalming room and is accused of "cremating" the food at the backyard barbecue. Harry's new assistant is Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), a zany cosmetologist who assures her employer: "I promise I'll take good care of these people. They deserve it. They're dead. All they've got left is their looks." Too much of the film's wit is in this same funny-as-a-corpse vein. 
There are also gags about the senility of Vada's grandmother (Ann Nelson) and the little girl's fanciful hypochondria, which has her deciding at one point that she has prostate cancer. Only slightly less ghoulish is the budding romance between Harry, who has been a widower since Vada's mother died in childbirth, and the unnaturally pert Shelly, who is supposed to be just thrilled to be taken on a date to a bingo game. Mr. Aykroyd, looking rotund and rather hangdog, makes a very unlikely romantic lead. Ms. Curtis tries gamely but unconvincingly to appear smitten. 
Also in the film are Griffin Dunne as the creative-writing teacher on whom Vada has a crush and Richard Masur as Harry's livelier, funnier brother. And then there's Mr. Culkin as Thomas J. Sennett, Vada's best friend. Thomas J., as he is called, is almost always second banana to the pretty, tomboyish Vada until the fateful day when he does something so foolhardy that it gets him killed. The fact that Mr. Culkin dies in this film has been widely publicized, but the circumstances are so farfetched and awful that they defy belief. 
It's not hard for the maudlin "My Girl" to make its audience weepy at the sight of America's favorite kid in an open coffin. But it    is    difficult for this film to mix the sugary unreality of a television show with such a clumsy and manipulative morbid streak. The screenplay, by Laurice Elehwany, is a collection of loose ends bound together only by intimations of mortality and family crisis, not to mention a vague notion of Vada's coming of age. All of these matters, incidentally, are handled with infinitely more grace by another current family drama with a young tomboy as its heroine, "The Man in the Moon." 
As directed by Howard Zieff, "My Girl" has a bizarrely light tone and an awkward pace, in part because it's hard for the director to keep track of the story's many half-developed subplots. The film's few laughs arise from Ms. Curtis's eagerness to put blue eye shadow on every corpse (the year is 1972, although not much about the costumes or backgrounds supports that) and Ms. Chlumsky's exaggerated bluntness. Ms. Chlumsky is a poised, lovely young actress whose competence is in a different league from Mr. Culkin's gifts as a remarkably funny Everykid. Whenever they appear together, she gets the close-ups but he steals the scene. 
"My Girl" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes      adult sexual references, talk about puberty and numerous references to death.

‽
‽For the Boys‽,‽The hardest thing Bette Midler has to do in "For the Boys," the big, sweeping multi-hanky musical in which she plays a U.S.O. entertainer named Dixie Leonard, is to pretend to be shy. When in 1942 Dixie is first approached to tour with an established star named Eddie Sparks (James Caan), she is all butterflies. Can she perform before a large crowd? Will she get over her jitters? The film may dwell on these questions, but its audience knows full well that Dixie Leonard, being a lot like Ms. Midler, can bring down the house even if she's playing an open-air arena in a war zone. 
That's the point, of course. "For the Boys," which is opening today at the Ziegfeld, is a custom-tailored showcase for Ms. Midler's talents, and it offers her a role in which screen character and offstage persona are powerfully intertwined. In the 1940's, a period toward which Ms. Midler has always shown an affinity, an actress with a personality this strong would always have fused her own larger-than-life image with that of whomever she was playing. Today that happens less often, but Ms. Midler has wisely taken the bull by the horns. Acting as one of her own producers, she has seen to it that "For the Boys" offers her an appealing, frank, always pivotal leading role, one that no one else could have played. 
"For the Boys," directed by Mark Rydell, is at its best when concentrating on Dixie, which it does most of the time. First seen in elaborate makeup as a tough-talking, embittered old broad, she feigns infirmity but still manages to convey great reserves of grandmotherly zip. This makes a strong contrast with the film's next sequence, in which the elderly Dixie remembers her first encounter with Eddie Sparks. Looking rosy, young and vital, Ms. Midler is an instant crowd-pleaser. And when she takes the stage with Eddie and walks off with the show, she takes command of the movie as well. 
"For the Boys" follows Eddie and Dixie through 50 years of what is essentially a rocky friendship and stormy business relationship, but not much more. This is surprising in view of the film's extravagantly romantic style and its portentous sense that some crucial development between Dixie and Eddie may be in the offing.  In fact, the real emphasis is on Dixie as the mother of Danny, who is a small boy in the 1940's scenes and a soldier by the time the film gets to Vietnam. In a way, "For the Boys" makes a clever choice in presenting Ms. Midler more as a noble, long-suffering mother figure with a flair for wisecracks than as a garden-variety romantic heroine. 
But even allowing for its lack of romantic chemistry (despite a fleeting one-night encounter that has Dixie back to her same old scathing remarks in the morning), the film has trouble with its central relationship, in part because James Caan never makes Eddie the magnetic figure he is supposed to be. Never credible as a famous song-and-dance man (although he displays more than enough temper and vanity for a star's role) and looking more like a world-weary carnival barker, Mr. Caan's Eddie is too easily upstaged by his partner and not enough of a foil. The screenplay, by Marshall Brickman, Neal Jimenez and Lindy Laub, never seems entirely certain of what it wants to see happening between them. 
Dixie works better in big, sometimes shamelessly sentimental tableaux than she does in intimate settings anyhow. This film's most touching moments generally occur either on Christmas or when Dixie and Eddie bring their act to war-torn places, first to North Africa, where Dixie is tearfully reunited with her husband and serenades him with "Come Rain or Come Shine" before a large, appreciative military crowd. 
Manipulative as this is, it presents Ms. Midler with some remarkable opportunities for heartstring-pulling, which she does especially well during the film's wrenching Vietnam chapter. Many other films have covered this territory, and done it better. But when Ms. Midler performs an eerily delicate, anthemlike rendition of "In My Life" to a group of soldiers who have come face-to-face with their own mortality, she adds something new. It's a moment that lingers long after the film is over. 
Ms. Midler's performance, even in a role as patently flattering and theatrical as this one, has an edge of candor that keeps her seeming very real. "For the Boys" is also deft in recapitulating various cultural landmarks of its time frame, from the ways in which pinups have changed through different wars to the progress of network television and its conventions. The film's brief, sardonic looks at television are often clever, and it even attempts a scene in which Dixie champions a blacklisted associate (who has been fired while wearing a Santa Claus suit at Christmas). "Me! Who always thought Karl was the sixth Marx brother, after Zeppo!" she complains after being punished by her network for this outburst. 
Also in "For the Boys" are George Segal as the uncle who helps give Dixie her start, Arye Gross as the nice young man who coaxes her onto television one last time, Dori Brenner as an early colleague and Christopher Rydell as the grown-up Danny and such ringers as Melissa Manchester and Bud Yorkin in small roles. The cast is big and helpful, but the star is always at center stage. 
"For the Boys" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual innuendoes and off-color language.

‽
‽Dingo‽,‽One day in the remote Australian village of Poona Flat, strange music drops out of the sky, and a little boy named John Anderson has an epiphany. It is 1969. A cargo plane carrying members of a jazz ensemble has been diverted to the outback for an unscheduled layover. As the villagers stare, dumbfounded, seven musicians file onto the runway and give an impromptu jazz concert. John is riveted by the sounds coming from the trumpet of the group's lead player, Billy Cross (Miles Davis). "You seemed tuned into it," Billy tells the star-struck boy afterward. "If you ever come to Paris, look me up." 
So begins Rolf de Heers's film "Dingo," a wildly romantic story about a jazz musician in pursuit of his muse. The 1991 film, which opens a two-week engagement today at Cinema Village, jumps forward two decades. John (Colin Friels), now married and the father of two girls, ekes out a living trapping the Australian wild dogs known as dingos. A largely self-taught trumpeter who has learned the instrument by studying Billy Cross records, he plays on weekends with a local "bush band," whose skiffle-style rock-and-roll has nothing to do with jazz. Alone in the desert, he aims his instrument at the sky and produces lonely warbling doglike cries that echo the sounds of his idol's records, and earn him the nickname Dingo. 
John, who corresponds with Billy's agent, has secretly saved $3,000 for a trip to Paris to reunite with his boyhood idol. In the last third of the movie, when he makes the trip, the film changes from a gritty portrait of a talented musician's frustrated life in the Australian boondocks into a starry-eyed fantasy of the jazz life in Paris. Within hours of his arrival, not only does John find himself treated like Billy's long-lost soul mate, he also wows the audience at an improbable jam session in a smart Parisian club. 
"Dingo," which switches abruptly back and forth between Australia and Paris, is a film with a seriously split personality. Just when the scenes of Billy playing in the local band, trapping dingos and squabbling with his wife, Jane (Helen Buday), have begun to cohere into a pungent portrait of Australian rural life, the movie fantasizes the Parisian jazz life as a millionaire's dream world. Despite strong, volatile performances by Mr. Friels and Ms. Buday, neither half of the story ultimately gets its due. And a subplot in which Jane is tempted to run off with her husband's wealthy childhood pal Peter (Joe Petruzzi) seems extraneous. 
In his dramatic-film debut, Davis, who died in September 1991, suggests an eccentric variation of his famously reclusive, enigmatic self. Sartorially eccentric and glowering through sunglasses with gold-studded frames, he delivers his lines in a gravelly whisper, with no facial expression at all. 
Although the film's discontinuities are somewhat redeemed by its score, composed by Michel Legrand and Davis, and featuring the trumpets of Davis and Chuck Findley, the music doesn't begin to make the film's two halves fit together. 
DINGO  Directed by Rolf de Heer; written by Marc Rosenberg; director of photography, Denis Lenoir; edited by Suresh Ayyar; music by Michel Legrand and Miles Davis; production designer, Judith Russell; produced by Mr. de Heer, Giorgio Draskovic, Marie-Pascale Osterrieth and Mr. Rosenberg; released by Greycat Films. At Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village. Running time: 108 minutes. This film is not rated.

‽Herman‽,‽Films about illness almost always take stronger attitudes toward their subjects than "Herman" does. This Norwegian film, which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, adopts a strangely whimsical, erratic tone as it tells of the title character, a handsome 11-year-old boy (Anders Danielson Lie) who reveals his medical condition in his first moments on screen. 
Herman has alopecia areata, a disease that has caused him to lose his hair. It has also transformed his inner life. With opening titles that evoke the robust, ski-sweater Scandinavia of the 1950's, "Herman" can treat its young hero's sickness as a form of unwanted social rebellion, something that sets him in direct opposition to the conformity of the world in which he is growing up. 
In that sense, his medical ordeal becomes a process of liberation, punctuated by peculiar flights of fancy. For instance, for reasons that the film never needs to explain, this Norwegian boy has made Zorro his imaginary playmate. His daydreams occasionally interrupt the telling of this coming-of-age story, though they rarely reveal more about the sunny, independent-minded Herman than the audience already knows. 
Had it confined itself to the isolating effects of Herman's medical ordeal, Erik Gustavson's film would have lived up to the somber foreshadowing with which it begins. As it is, "Herman" fluctuates unpredictably between uplifting moments and upsetting ones, which may well have been what the director had in mind.  But the effect leaves the film ultimately at cross-purposes with itself, and not easily able to generate much emotion. Although young Mr. Lie, a feisty and earnest young actor, plays the title role with great sincerity, Herman remains a mild, loosely drawn character without strong impact. 
"Herman," which has a jolly, genial manner during many of its domestic scenes (and an unduly playful one when it jokes too heartily over Herman's giving a urine specimen during a medical exam), has been made with competence and care. Its look evokes a strenuously cheerful culture very like that seen on American television shows, particularly those with an inspirational edge. As Herman's parents, Elisabeth Sand and Bjorn Floberg generate a mixture of love and concern that would be appropriate for any character of Herman's tender age, with or without his health problems. Also briefly in the film is a little girl on whom Herman has a schoolboy crush -- and whose full, gorgeous head of red hair is a cruel reminder of his own situation. Their final scene together gives the film one of its stronger grace notes. 
"Herman," a gently charming film of only moderate weight, was one of last year's Academy Award nominees in the best foreign film category, where the choice of nominees has been quite controversial in recent years. "Herman" only adds fuel to that fire. Herman

‽Trespass‽,‽"Trespass" is an outlandishly melodramatic, all-male morality fable about two white firemen from Arkansas who go hunting for buried treasure in an abandoned, exceptionally photogenic factory in East St. Louis, Ill. In the course of their search, they are discovered by the members of a gang of black hoodlums who, thinking the off-duty firefighters are on-duty policemen, set out to capture and murder them.  Most of the violent cat-and-mouse game takes place inside the factory within one day that seems 96 hours long. 
The movie was written by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, best known for the "Back to the Future" comedies, and directed by Walter Hill ("Southern Comfort," "The Driver," "48 Hours"), whose hand has never been heavier. The cast is headed by Bill Paxton and William Sadler, who play the firemen (one good guy and one bad guy), and Ice-T and Ice Cube, the rap performers who appear as the two principal gang members. Art Evans gives the film's most interesting performance as a homeless black man who lives in the factory and whose routine is disturbed by the warring interlopers. 
That Mr. Gale and Mr. Zemeckis are very funny writers is nowhere apparent in "Trespass." With the exception of a running gag about the gangsters' use of cellular telephones, the film is singularly humorless.  Though full of the kind of simulated violence achieved by special-effects artists, it's not too heavy on suspense.  Everything in the screenplay seems arbitrary, including the firefighting jobs assigned to the two would-be treasure-seekers. They could as easily be magazine salesmen or amateur songwriters. 
The movie also never makes clear the crimes of choice of this particular gang, though drugs would seem to be obvious. Ice-T and Ice Cube may be ravaging rappers on records and television, but they seem to be especially lightweight presences in "Trespass," less menacing than attitudinizing.  They both adopt fixed frowns and use a lot racial epithets, but their favorite 12-letter obscenity now sounds like an endearment. In particular, Ice Cube appears to have been denatured, possibly because he's denied recourse to the crotch-clutching gesture that best defines the politics of his music videos. 
Mr. Hill has difficulty filling the running time. There is much creeping around litter-filled corridors, stairwells, chimneys and air shafts. Hostages are taken. Every now and then a fierce gunfight breaks out, at which point the film's sound levels are turned up to awaken the drowsy.

‽Peter's Friends‽,‽"Peter's Friends," a cheerfully derivative comedy about a group of old friends enjoying a house-party reunion, borrows so blatantly from "The Big Chill" that it takes a while to realize this film has some life of its own. Once again, the principals are brought together to reconsider the courses of their lives. Once again, these decisions are made to the tune of an ebullient rock soundtrack. Once again, thoughts of mortality lend substance to what otherwise would look like lighthearted fun. 
The setting this time is a grand English manor house, which Peter (Stephen Fry) has recently inherited in one of the film's more conspicuous coming-of-age touches. A decade earlier, the principals were college chums joining forces to stage a giddy New Year's Eve musical revue. But they are now at a more serious stage in their lives. 
Maggie (Emma Thompson) is desperately lonely, and determined to do something about it. Roger and Mary (Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton) are recovering from the loss of a child. Sarah (Alphonsia Emmanuel) has embarked on one too many ill-considered affairs, this one with Brian (Tony Slattery), a married actor. Brian's biggest dramatic accomplishment is feigning interest in what others have to say. 
Kenneth Branagh, who produced and directed the film, also appears as Andrew, who once aspired to be a serious playwright and is now best known as the creator of an American sitcom. Appearing as Carol, his brassy American wife, is Rita Rudner, who wrote the screenplay with her husband, Martin Bergman, and all but steals the film. "Did you ever see 'Upstairs, Downstairs?' " Carol worriedly asks Peter's cook, who has somehow failed to jump at her orders the way they do back in Hollywood. 
Arriving with a load of exercise equipment and a Rodeo Drive wardrobe that is a comedy act all by itself, Ms. Rudner's Carol makes no bones about not fitting in with her husband's English friends. Looking around the manor, she denies that a house of hers in Bel Air was vulgar, saying, "It was just like this, only everything was brand new." Inspecting her room, she complains to Peter about the lack of a television set, only to learn there are none anywhere in the house. "That's all right, I'll read," she says bravely. "Does anyone have a book?" 
As the foil to such a flamboyant character, Mr. Branagh has a lot to work with. "If we stay together five years, I get free hair transplants and she gets a new set of breasts," he tells Peter, while discussing the likely longevity of the marriage. "So then she'll have four?" Peter asks. "No, her agent gets one," Andrew answers. 
Although "Peter's Friends" eventually sounds a note of gravity, and although it addresses AIDS more directly than many films have, it remains a lightweight entertainment, enjoyable mostly for the fun of hearing arch, skillful actors deliver droll remarks. Mr. Branagh's direction is blithe and serviceable without having any particular hallmarks, save perhaps an appreciation of the talent he has assembled. If the film didn't have two vulgar show-biz characters to make fun of, it would have a lot less verve. 
Ms. Thompson is once again a delight, fidgeting nervously in shapeless smocks until Ms. Rudner's Carol says, "You are a very pretty girl, yes, but you make Mother Teresa look like a hooker." As Maggie, she is so insecure that she leaves Polaroids of herself all over her apartment for the benefit of her cat, who apparently couldn't care less. Maggie's desire to win over Peter is only one of the romantic currents that keep the film more or less in motion. Another subplot has to do with the promiscuity of Sarah, of whom Andrew says: "You know those mice that go round on wheels? Imagine one wearing a tight leather skirt." "Peter's Friends," sunny and superficial, works best on the level of quips like that.

‽
‽Hoffa‽,‽IN his 1960 book, "The Enemy Within," Robert F. Kennedy, soon to be the Attorney General of the United States, wrote about his first face-to-face meeting with the man he had sworn to send to prison, James R. Hoffa, the powerful president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Kennedy was surprised by how short the labor leader was, "only five feet five and a half." 
Anyone who knows anything about Hoffa's rise and fall will be similarly surprised by how much he's grown in "Hoffa," the riveting, almost impressionistic new film biography, written with mean brilliance by David Mamet and directed by Danny DeVito in a splashy style best described as Las Vegas Empire. 
The film not only presents a Jimmy Hoffa with the beefed-up physical dimensions of Jack Nicholson, who gives a gigantic powerhouse of a performance, but it also effectively rearranges the hierarchy of American heroes as it's understood in the 1990's. Many people may be uncomfortably surprised. 
"Hoffa" sees Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 in the middle of his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, as he was perceived by Hoffa: a whiny, aggressive, Harvard-educated rich kid desperate for publicity, ready to use fair means and foul to trap Hoffa, and no match at all for Hoffa in their furious verbal confrontations. 
Mr. DeVito and Mr. Mamet don't whitewash Hoffa, but they seem almost nonjudgmental about him. By omission they appear to sanction a complicated, very dubious, if colorful, character. In the context of most commercial movies today, which insist on explaining too much or repeating the obvious at seemingly endless length, "Hoffa" remains cool and detached, not unlike Mr. DeVito's very funny, very dark comedy, "The War of the Roses." Yet "Hoffa" is not a comedy. It is a take on history. 
It's a serious consideration of the career of a man whose gift for the expedient and personally profitable alliance was the near-equal of Talleyrand's. Hoffa's ties to the Mafia not only cost the rank-and-file teamsters millions of dollars but also set a pattern for corruption that tainted the entire labor movement. His is a quintessentially American story, for only in America did Big Labor become a big business to rival Big Business. 
"Hoffa" is a remarkable movie, an original and vivid cinematic work, but is that enough? I think it is. Others will have legitimate objections to the ways the film operates. 
Mr. DeVito and Mr. Mamet stay at a discreet distance from Hoffa, neither sentimentalizing him nor attempting to analyze him beyond his own automatic defense that you have to do it unto others before others do it unto you. Without comment, and in very general terms, they document Hoffa's evolution from small-time labor reformer to big-time labor racketeer, master shakedown artist and influence-peddler, and friend to mobsters of frightening moment. 
The tale is told in a series of flashbacks from the last day of Hoffa's life. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa disappeared forever, having been shot, according to some reports, his body placed inside an automobile compactor, the remains then buried in a location that no one yet has discovered. 
The movie opens as the nervous, exhausted Jimmy, accompanied by his trusted factotum and pal, a fictitious character named Bobby Ciaro (Mr. DeVito), waits in the back seat of a Cadillac in the parking lot of a roadhouse near Detroit. Jimmy has an appointment with a long-time Mafia associate who, he hopes, will support him in his attempts to win back his place as the teamsters' president. Convicted of jury-tampering and sent to jail in 1967, Jimmy was paroled in 1971 on the condition that he remain out of union politics until 1980. It's not a condition he has ever taken seriously. 
The recollections that are the body of the film are not Jimmy's, but the adoring, busy Bobby's. Bobby can't sit still. He paces around the parking lot, goes into the roadhouse to make phone calls, returns with paper cups of coffee for Jimmy, reminisces a bit, gets out of the car again and paces. 
Bobby frets over Jimmy's situation, recalling his first meeting with the vital, energetic Jimmy in the depressed 1930's when, one night on the road, Jimmy invited himself into the cab of his truck and attempted to recruit him for the teamsters. Jimmy was then something of an idealist. As the long day passes in the parking lot, Bobby chronologically remembers his way through Jimmy's career: their days as members of a teamster goon squad, torching a company that failed to recognize the union; Jimmy's success in a brutal confrontation with police while organizing the Railway Transport workers, and his introduction to the Mafia in the person of (the fictitious) Carol D'Allesandro (Armand Assante). He's the film's representation of the forces that provided much of the pressure and muscle that made possible Hoffa's rise within the teamsters' union. 
In one of the film's more bizarre inventions, Bobby remembers a crucial hunting trip during which D'Allesandro outlines the ways Jimmy might manipulate the teamsters' pension fund to make loans to the mob and enrich all concerned, with the exception of the membership. As the two men are signing an agreement on the back of a hunting license, Bobby, not a natural hunter, spots a sluggish deer, takes out his pistol and shoots it between the eyes. 
Although Bobby's memory is fond, "Hoffa" sees all impassively, with a shrug that seems to ask, "Well, what can you do about it?" This gives "Hoffa" a bitterly skeptical edge that is rare in American movies. It forces viewers to make up their own minds, something that can be immensely disorienting as well as rewarding. The film suggests there are times when you have to think for yourself. 
A more reasonable objection to the movie is the way it necessarily foreshortens history, simplifies events, and either ignores important real-life characters or reinvents them as composites. This is dramatic license, but dramatic license often seriously distorts, which is not easily acceptable when the subject is as rich and significant as the Jimmy Hoffa story. 
The movie notes in passing, but doesn't appear to understand, Hoffa's real achievement in negotiating the precedent-setting National Master Freight Agreement, guaranteeing teamsters uniform wage and benefit conditions across the country. The movie also doesn't begin to suggest the profound complexity of Hoffa's connections to the mob, his relations to his wife and family, and the teamsters' connections to the Government. A lot has been left out, which is unfortunate, since the snarl of these relationships is what seems finally to have done him in. 
The great thing about "Hoffa" is that it doesn't pretend to be a docudrama or anything like it. It's not a vulgarized rip-off of Costa-Gavras movies, reduced to the exploitation of the latest case of murder, kidnapping or child molestation, or a briefly notorious domestic disagreement. "Hoffa" is an original work of fiction, based on fact, conceived with imagination and a consistent point of view. 
In addition to Mr. Assante and Mr. DeVito, the excellent supporting cast includes J. T. Walsh as Hoffa's colleague and successor, Frank Fitzsimmons; John C. Reilly as a protege who squeals on Hoffa; Natalija Nogulich, briefly seen as Jimmy's wife; Kevin Anderson as Robert Kennedy; Frank Whaley as a young man befriended by Bobby in the course of the day in the roadhouse parking lot, and Robert Prosky as another early associate of Jimmy. 
Mr. DeVito's direction is full of extravagant gestures that seem entirely in keeping with Bobby's highly colored memories of life with Jimmy. There are a number of grand overhead shots, as if the camera were in the position of a gaudy casino chandelier, whether it's a scene of Jimmy in prison or a panoramic view of union men fighting scabs. At the same time, Mr. DeVito knows when to use close-ups, that is, to reveal character rather than to punctuate dialogue. When the director shows a remembered explosion and fire, they have the huge proportions of something reported in a tall story told late at night in a favorite bar. 
Mr. Nicholson has altered his looks, voice and speech to evoke Hoffa, but the performance is composed less of superficial tricks than of the actor's crafty intelligence and conviction. The performance is spookily compelling without being sympathetic for a minute. Unlike Norman Jewison's "F.I.S.T." (1978), an underrated Sylvester Stallone movie about a Hoffa-like character, the new film doesn't mourn Jimmy's lost innocence. "Hoffa" is a tough movie about American life. It hasn't time for tears. 
"Hoffa," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), is full of obscene language and violence.

‽
‽Indochine‽,‽Catherine Deneuve reigns in "Indochine." That is, she presides over its second-rate fiction with the manner of an empress who knows her powers are constitutionally limited but who continues to take her duties seriously.  She can't change the course of the film, but her lofty presence keeps it from flying apart. She plays Eliane who, when first met in 1930, divides her time between a mansion near Saigon and a successful rubber plantation, which she oversees with (sometimes for) her widowed father. 
Miss Deneuve has her work cut out for her, since the new French film, made on location at great expense and with attention to historical accuracy, intends to be nothing less than epic. "Indochine" is the story of the last 25 years of French rule in Indochina as reflected by the events in Eliane's life. The subject is potentially rich, but the screenplay, whomped up by three screenwriters in collaboration with Regis Wargnier, the director, has neither the conviction of fact, the sense of revelation found in good fiction, nor the fun of trashy literature. 
In 1930 Eliane enjoys all the perks that accrue to the dominant class in a smoothly functioning colonial society. Though French by birth, she has never seen France. She was born and reared in Indochina, which she considers as much her home as it is for the anonymous laborers who work on her plantation. Eliane is not as bigoted as some French. She is bringing up Camille (Linh Dan Pham) as her own daughter. The pretty teen-ager, an Annamese princess, was adopted by Eliane after her parents -- Eliane's best friends -- were killed in an accident. 
Since Eliane is France to a large extent, it's not surprising that her life falls apart more or less in concert with French colonial rule, and that her heartbreak and (dare I say?) her hopes parallel those of France itself.  She's sorely tried, both as an adoring mother and as the conscience of a great European nation. 
Camille has been betrothed since childhood to Tanh (Eric Nguyen), a well-born Vietnamese fellow whom she likes but does not love. She shatters her adoptive mother by falling madly in love with Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez), a handsome, mostly uncharacterized French naval officer, who had once been Eliane's lover. 
Eliane puts her foot down, but Camille runs off to join Jean-Baptiste at the remote outpost to which Eliane has arranged that he be sent. It's the beginning of the end for both the motherland and Eliane. I'm not giving away one-tenth of what happens in the movie by reporting that the feckless Tanh turns out to be a sort of Vietnamese Scarlet Pimpernel, a dedicated, recklessly brave Vietnamese freedom fighter and Communist. 
Camille, too, is politicized, becoming known as "the red princess" for her underground activities. When last heard from in 1954, she's at the table in Geneva, a member of the Indochinese committee negotiating independence from France. 
It's not easy for any movie, even one running for 2 hours and 35 minutes, to cover so much time and history and still maintain its coherence as drama. Though Eliane is the film's focal point, she is not Scarlett O'Hara.  Eliane has her weaknesses: she falls in love with the wrong man, and she occasionally seeks solace in a pipe of opium. Yet she's not so much a character as a beautiful, somewhat frosty icon, like the statue of Marianne, the official symbol of the French Republic for which Miss Deneuve's likeness was used in 1985. 
Without seeming to age a day from 1930 to 1954, Miss Deneuve moves through "Indochine" more as an observer than as a participant. Her Eliane/Marianne is not an embodiment of the ideals of the French Revolution, but a representation of the kind of chic associated with Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. 
She looks ravishing from start to finish. She's supremely unruffled when a man with a nosebleed attempts to make love to her. Not a hair is out of place as she beats a worker for attempting to run away from the plantation. She's not a particular woman but an abstraction as she tells the victim, "Do you think I like beating my children?" 
In spite of all that, Miss Deneuve lends the movie a lot of her own instinctive intelligence. Behind the movie-star facade, a real actress is at work. It's not her regal beauty but the force of her personality that carries the viewer through a choppy screenplay not always easy to follow. It may be that the film has been re-edited for its American release, but whatever the reason, characters seem to disappear before their time, or to appear on screen without having been properly introduced. In the etiquette of cinema, this is called rude editing.  There also are times when the soundtrack music hails an emotional crescendo that only it recognizes. 
Aside from Miss Deneuve's performance, the only one worth noting is that of Jean Yanne, whose acting style has become increasingly self-important and busy since the early 1970's when he appeared in two fine Claude Chabrol films, "This Man Must Die" and "Le Boucher." Here he plays the head of the French security police in Saigon, a jaded functionary who half-heartedly courts Eliane while wearily going about his brutal job. 
"Indochine" offers the audience much more history and many more views of the Vietnamese landscape than can be seen in "The Lover," Jean-Jacques Annaud's fine, laconic screen adaptation of the Marguerite Duras novel, also set in Vietnam in the 1930's. Yet "The Lover" evokes subtle truths about colonial relationships that are effectively buried in the epic fanciness of "Indochine." 
"Indochine," which has been rated PG-13 (under 13 strongly cautioned), has scenes of violence.

‽
‽Toys‽,‽BARRY LEVINSON'S "Toys" is a magnificent mess, a chaotic fantasy set in a brilliantly vivid, Surreal landscape that recalls the paintings of Magritte and the pop-up illustrations in children's books. Dada is also evoked, though less consistently. "Toys" dazzles the eye even as the mind goes numb attending to the narrative, which is about the apocalyptic battle for control of Zevo Toys, where whimsy is said to be a tradition but is more like a curse. 
Here is a nonmusical "Babes in Toyland" crossed with "Dr. Strangelove," a danceless "Nutcracker" that suggests "Paradise Lost," yet plays as if it were the nightmare of a child of 4. "Toys" is supposed to be spontaneous and fun, but it has a drearily self-important message stolen from a bumper sticker: War is hazardous to children and other living things. 
It's impossible to tell for whom this movie was made. 
Very young children would seem to be the target audience, though they won't have a clue as to what's going on. Their adult companions will be driven to dreamless slumber. Masochistic film students may possibly respond. The confusions of "Toys" are so many that they appear intentional, as if arcane truths were to be discovered somewhere within. 
Just before ailing old Kenneth Zevo (Donald O'Connor) dies, he entrusts the family toy company to his brother, the mad General Zevo (Michael Gambon), whose life has been without purpose since the end of the cold war. Thus passed over are Leslie (Robin Williams) and Alsatia Zevo (Joan Cusack), Kenneth's children, both of whom acknowledge that they are too innocent to run the factory that is their world. 
Leslie spends his days moving happily around the assembly lines where smiling workers put together dolls, stuffed animals and the kinds of harmless toys that kids drop out of car windows. He is especially fond of novelties made for joke stores: water glasses that drip, fake deviled eggs and blobs of plastic in the shape of what the movie genteelly calls dog poop. At one point he demonstrates a spectacular smoking jacket, which is a jacket that emits smoke. 
Alsatia is more interested in paper dolls, and wears clothes that are fixed to her body as if they were paper-doll outfits. At the end of the day, Leslie and Alsatia go home to their pretty pop-up Victorian mansion, set among a series of vast green, treeless hills, where Alsatia sleeps in what looks to be a golden sarcophagus shaped like a duck. 
Meanwhile, the general sets about to turn Zevo Toys into a high-tech armaments plant. His inspiration: the cool reflexes displayed by little boys playing the kinds of video war games that Zevo has firmly refused to manufacture. The general's idea is to revolutionize war by the development of miniature, nuclear-equipped airplanes, rockets and whatnot that any child could operate by remote control. 
It takes Leslie and Alsatia some time to realize that things aren't what they used to be at Zevo Toys. Trusted employees are being let go, including the lady who used to paint lips on alligators. The general hires storm troopers to protect his private laboratories. His curiosity piqued, Leslie sneaks into the general's workshop one day to discover the awful truth: a huge collection of vile video games and war toys. Leslie's reaction: "My God, F. A. O. Schwarzkopf!" 
War soon erupts at Zevo Toys as the forces of heaven, led by Leslie and Alsatia, take on those of hell, the general's mechanized, computerized toys, which initially massacre the teddy bears, dolls and novelties that Leslie throws into the struggle. It's just one of the many contradictions of "Toys" that the film, which is antiwar, comes to life only in this spectacular if muddled confrontation.  In the context of a movie that makes such a big thing of innocence, the mayhem of the battle is pretty strong stuff, especially when a principal character is decapitated. 
There are, in fact, a number of wars going on in this antiwar movie.  The most apparent is the struggle between the brilliant imagination of Ferdinando Scarfiotti, the production designer, and the banal, fake-innocent conceits of Mr. Levinson, who directed the movie and wrote the screenplay with Valerie Curtin.  Though Mr. Scarfiotti is reported to have used Dada as an inspiration for the film's look, nothing in the script has much to do with Dada's resolute antipathy to reason. "Toys" doesn't exalt randomness. It is the victim of it. The film has no consistent vision.  Even worse, it's not very funny. Leslie, Alsatia and their friends laugh more often than the audience does. 
Mr. Williams seems peculiarly subdued. His monologues in "Good Morning, Vietnam" have far more to do with the exuberant iconoclasm of Dada than does anything in "Toys." He has the occasional rude line, but he spends most of the film behaving with immense politeness, which is apparently to be equated with innocence. 
There's also something fatally wrongheaded about the film's attempts to equate Leslie's humane impulses with the sorts of toys that for perfectly good reason, would bore most children today. No adult of a certain age can have forgotten how quickly the windup toy always ran down. Though war toys aren't great, "Toys" sometimes gives the impression that it would like to disinvent everything that's battery-operated and remote-controlled. 
While "Toys" means to celebrate the benign paternalism of Zevo Toys before the maniacal general takes over, it presents a far scarier picture of assembly-line labor than anything in "Modern Times." Beneath giant plaster heads of pastel-colored animals, the Zevo workers go about their tasks with the blank expressions of people who have been lobotomized and then had smiles surgically fixed to their faces. 
It takes time to get the full measure of the film's failure. Not since "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" has there been a movie set in such a stylish, hermetically sealed environment, calling up a world where absolutely nothing is real. The effect is sort of pleasant for a while, like being in a weightless state. Eventually, though, whimsy takes over, nausea threatens and patience runs out. 
Mr. Gambon ("The Singing Detective") has fun as the mad general, but it's a role that Mr. Williams might have done equally well, and with some of the mania that "Toys" so desperately lacks. The only two performers who come out of this film unscathed are Robin Wright, who plays Leslie's sweetly dippy girlfriend, and LL Cool J, the rap performer, who appears as the white general's black son. The screenplay offers no explanation for this color difference, which becomes one of its few good jokes. 
Mr. Levinson reportedly hoped to direct "Toys" years ago as his first film, but good fortune kept getting in the way as he went on to direct "Diner," "Tin Men, "Good Morning, Vietnam," "Rain Man" and "Bugsy," among other hits. 
His luck finally ran out. 
"Toys" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some vulgar language and simulated violence.

‽
‽Leap of Faith‽,‽It is a tacit seasonal tradition that smaller, more interesting films arriving in December are often trampled in the all-star holiday stampede. It would be too bad if that happened to "Leap of Faith," the lively story of an Elmer Gantry for the computer age. 
Well acted and amusingly told, featuring a fine performance by Steve Martin in the central role, this tale ultimately switches gears and takes a deeply serious turn. "If I get the job done, what difference does it make?" Mr. Martin's Rev. Jonas Nightengale, a bogus faith healer, asks twice during the story. The second answer he receives sums up the film's fundamental message: "It makes all the difference in the world." 
"Leap of Faith" begins by pointing out that Jonas is a person of real talent. Sweet-talking a highway patrolman out of giving him a ticket, Jonas instinctively guesses where the man's vulnerabilities lie and exploits those weaknesses brilliantly. He likes to perform such feats with the help of Jane (Debra Winger), the clever manager who gives Jonas constant back talk and runs every aspect of his traveling road show. 
Jane even feeds Jonas helpful information using an earpiece and a radio transmitter. This preacher might well be able to wow audiences on his own, but it helps to have Jane studying a floor plan of the faithful, telling him exactly where to find the heavy drinker, the pregnant teen-ager, the worker who has just been laid off or the farmer who is desperate for rain. That way Jonas, who leaps and skips and works the stage like a rock star, can shout all the appropriate "Halleluljahs!" and dazzle listeners with his intuition. 
Jonas's large entourage ordinarily plays good-size cities. But when a bus breaks down, the group is forced to stay in a small, impoverished Kansas town. As the flimflam operation rolls into tiny Rustwater, the soundtrack offers exactly the right musical accompaniment: "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" from "Guys and Dolls," the song about a con artist getting his comeuppance from the faithful, as performed in a lilting reggae version by Don Henley. The film is full of similarly small, perfect touches, and never makes the mistake of calling attention to them. 
As directed with care and intelligence by Richard Pearce ("The Long Walk Home," "Country"), "Leap of Faith" turns cynicism into a peculiar virtue. This is demonstrated in a wonderful montage that shows Jonas's "Miracles and Wonders" road show setting up in Rustwater after Jane, who is the group's resident charmer, has sweet-talked a permit out of the local sheriff (Liam Neeson). In this montage, all the con artists' tricks are revealed: a full supply of crutches and wheelchairs, a system for tipping off Jonas about the audience, a life-size statue of Jesus passed around by roadies as if it were a prop in a rock show. 
Yet amid all this activity something miraculous really does begin to happen. Mr. Pearce spins together an inspiring sequence as the tent rises up, the show comes together, the gospel choir rehearses gloriously as the singers stand simply by the side of the road. At this moment, the audience can simultaneously feel the dual strengths of faith and doubt just as surely as Jonas can. It is thus prepared for the crisis of confidence upon which this story, like any "Rainmaker"-type tale, must eventually hinge. 
Mr. Martin's performance, surprisingly jaunty under the circumstances, is as remarkable for its restraint as for its energy. The temptation to reduce Jonas's slickness to broad parody is gracefully avoided; so is the immense maudlin potential of any tale in which the con man comes to sympathize with the little people and regret the error of his ways. Rolling into town unabashedly in a T-shirt, cowboy hat and gold chain, Mr. Martin's Jonas is a model of self-assurance, and the public be damned. "Always look better than they do," he jokes, while getting dressed for a show. 
As "Leap of Faith" slowly closes in on Jonas's spiritual crisis, it heads for trouble. In conventional Hollywood terms, at least, there is no way to embrace this film's ultimate outlook without losing part of the audience along the way. To its credit, this film sticks to its convictions and ignores that worry, at the expense of a happy-ending payoff or a clear resolution. Yet the attempt to take the central question of faith seriously becomes gratifying in its own, much quieter way. 
As written colorfully by Janus Cercone, "Leap of Faith" includes a number of potentially sentimental subplots, including one involving a pretty waitress (Lolita Davidovich) and her disabled brother (Lukas Haas, so well cast that he and Ms. Davidovich seem to share a family resemblance). Jonas dispenses with any weepy aspects of this situation by snappishly calling the boy "Tiny Tim," and takes a similarly caustic attitude throughout the movie. Another subplot, linking Ms. Winger's Jane to Mr. Neeson's sheriff, also risks turning sticky. But Ms. Winger, very well matched as a pal of Mr. Martin's, ably adopts the glib, self-protecting banter that gets these phony healers through the day. Even as the sarcasm falls away later in the story, and even when surrounded by a shower of miraculous butterflies (one of the few fancy effects used), Ms. Winger's Jane remains appealingly direct. 
From its small-town coffee shop to its "I Am Saved" T-shirts, "Leap of Faith" has the right look for the story it means to tell. Immense support is provided by the Angels of Mercy, the real-life singers (including La Chanze, Delores Hall and Albertina Walker) who do a beautiful job of playing Jonas's gospel choir. 
"Leap of Faith" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity. Leap of Faith  Directed by Richard Pearce; written by Janus Cercone; director of photography, Matthew F. Leonetti; edited by Don Zimmerman; music by Cliff Eidelman; production designer, Patrizia von Brandenstein; produced by Michael Manheim and David V. Picker; released by Paramount Pictures.

‽Forever Young‽,‽"Forever Young" has the manner of something that was made in the kind of perfect vacuum that can be achieved only in a Hollywood bell jar. Here's a romantic comedy in which Mel Gibson plays a pre-World War II test pilot who, accidently defrosted after spending more than half a century in a cryogenic capsule, learns about life and love in 1992. 
When first seen in 1939, Daniel McCormick (Mr. Gibson) seems to have the world in the palm of his hand. He's not only at the top of his class as a flier, but he's also in love with and loved by an ideal woman, Helen (Isabel Glasser), a successful magazine photographer. Daniel has one small failing: marriage scares him, though for no reason more special than that the story requires it. 
When Helen is suddenly run over in the street and declared brain dead, the distraught Daniel volunteers to be the first human guinea pig in a cryogenic experiment. After all, he's not going anyplace, nor is Helen. He accepts his deep-freeze willingly. What with one thing and another, including World War II, he's forgotten until two small boys of the 1990's come upon his abandoned but still icy crypt in a warehouse. It's at this point that "Forever Young," which has been unraveling for some time, really starts. 
Written by Jeffrey Abrams ("Regarding Henry") and directed by Steve Miner, "Forever Young" has nothing much to do with anything except the movie conventions of an earlier time when near-fatal accidents, wild coincidences and miraculous resurrections were the way life was lived on the silver screen. Plausibility is not important in this sort of movie; everything depends on the charm, style and verve with which it's played. 
This is Mr. Gibson's department. He passes through "Forever Young" with the self-assurance of a Hollywood star of the great studio era, someone who in good pictures and bad remains magically and consistently his own idealized self. Mr. Gibson is good enough to give the film substance, making "Forever Young" far easier to sit through than it has any right to be. 
Jamie Lee Curtis also is attractive as Claire, the gutsy 1990's woman who befriends Daniel and with whom he has a brief flirtation, almost forgetting his still strong commitment to the memory of the brain-dead Helen. I shouldn't reveal more about the plot except to emphasize that, brain death aside, it is a romantic comedy. 
This is not always apparent while one is watching the film. Though "Forever Young" initially would have you believe that Daniel and Helen share some kind of transforming passion, Helen is forgotten for much of the running time. The heart is earnestly warmed instead by Daniel's friendship with Claire's 11-year-old son, Nat (Elijah Wood), whom he teaches to fly. There are also some obligatory Rip Van Winkle gags about Daniel's reaction to television, telephone answering machines and such. 
"Forever Young" looks to be very much a star vehicle. Because of that, it may not be fair to blame either the writer or director for its lack of narrative focus. The star is the center of everything. The physical production is handsome and elaborate, but nothing deflects attention from Mr. Gibson for any length of time, not even Ms. Curtis. Ms. Glasser is not around long enough to establish her own screen presence. Even George Wendt, the formidably funny "Cheers" star, who plays the inventor of Daniel's deep-freeze chamber, does not make much of an impression. 
The only thing that gives Mr. Gibson competition is a great Billie Holiday recording of the Ray Noble standard "The Very Thought of You." Daniel and Helen consider it their song. It later turns up as a favorite of Claire in 1992. Lady Day was not exactly a household name in 1939. That Daniel and Helen should have cherished her then lends them more class and character than anything else in the movie. 
"Forever Young" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mildly vulgar language.

‽Passion Fish‽,‽May-Alice (Mary McDonnell) was on her way to a leg-waxing appointment when her life changed forever. Hit by a car as she got out of a taxicab in New York City, May-Alice was left permanently paralyzed. She formerly worked as a soap-opera actress, but nothing she simulated on television can match the drama her real life now offers. She is seen in a hospital, waking up to the daunting facts of her new life, as John Sayles's "Passion Fish" begins. 
Stunned at first, May-Alice soon develops a caustically bitter way of dealing with her frustration. She keeps to herself and drinks too much. She remains angry and proud. She mocks those who try to help her and, even more mercilessly, she mocks herself. "It's important that we have clean walls," she snaps at one of the many nurses she employs briefly, then fires or scares away. "I'll be climbing them soon." 
When solicitous old friends come to visit, after May-Alice has relocated to her girlhood home in Louisiana, she is even worse. "Didn't we always say, 'I wonder how May-Alice is going to end up?' " asks one chatty, thoughtless matron who drops by. May-Alice stares, drilling holes into her guest's empty head. "Well, now you know," she flatly replies. 
"Passion Fish," a film much less precious than its title (which refers to a Cajun superstition about finding love), is about the spiritual rebirth that finally occurs within May-Alice.  It's also about the strong, sympathetic helpmate who makes such regeneration possible. The right nurse finally comes along in the person of Chantelle (Alfre Woodard), who is only slightly cowed by May-Alice's insults and has had enough troubles of her own to understand her employer's mean streak. 
As played memorably by Ms. Woodard, a quietly voluptuous actress who conveys vast inner strength, Chantelle is willing to help May-Alice only on her own terms, thus providing the kind of toughness and back talk her patient desperately needs. "Have you been doing this long?" May-Alice asks Chantelle curtly during their job interview.  "No," Chantelle answers. "You?" 
If this situation sounds fraught with the danger of sentimentality, it certainly is. But Mr. Sayles's writing and direction are refreshingly blunt, going over the top only when taking cheap shots at some of May-Alice's tiresome old friends. Though the story is essentially house-bound, set in the soothing Louisiana household as May-Alice gradually re-establishes herself there, it manages to introduce a varied stream of visitors. Collectively, they keep the film moving and prevent it from looking inward to a stultifying degree. 
"Passion Fish" was also edited by Mr. Sayles, who adopts a leisurely pace and often slows down to emphasize the seductive charm of Cajun culture. His film is warmly appealing, played with subtlety and intelligence by both its stars. But like many of this season's releases, "Passion Fish" is needlessly long. With a two-and-a-quarter-hour running time, this essentially modest film often seems to be luxuriating in the story of Chantelle and May-Alice rather than making sure that story gets told. 
Also in "Passion Fish," and well matched with Ms. McDonnell's touchingly stubborn May-Alice, is David Strathairn as a Louisiana native who looked good to her as a teen-ager, and looks even better now that he is a father of five. Mr. Strathairn appears in two of the film's more magical sequences, a dream that restores May-Alice to her earlier, sexually adventurous self and an all-day boat ride through the bayou that becomes a larger sort of journey. In these sequences, Mr. Strathairn's handsome, down-to-earth Rennie serves as both a reminder of everyday reality and a secret avenue of escape. 
Also contributing mightily to the Southern charm of "Passion Fish" are Vondie Curtis-Hall as the rural blacksmith who somehow persuades the wary Chantelle to let down her guard, and Leo Burmester as the wayward, tippling uncle in two-toned shoes, a colorful sine qua non in such a story. Sheila Kelley and Angela Bassett (Betty Shabazz in "Malcolm X") have some good moments as a couple of soap opera queens from May-Alice's past. 
Equally helpful, on a different note, is Marianne Muellerleile as the scariest and most exacting in a long parade of unlucky nurses. The nurses' scenes are edited together in a funny, bad-audition type montage, during which one particularly pesty nurse insists on grilling May-Alice about other stars (with character names like Raven and Dominique), whom she presumably knows from other soaps. "There's not like a room where they store us all between shows," May-Alice replies in exasperation. 
"Passion Fish" opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, where it will play for the one-week run necessary for Academy Award eligibility.  Its gentle manner contrasts nicely with the hot air of many higher-powered Christmas releases. 
This film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, sexual references and sexual situations.

‽
‽A Few Good Men‽,‽The role doesn't have to be big, but if it's good, and if the actor playing it is great, the results can be magically transforming. Witness Jack Nicholson's vicious, funny, superbly reptilian turn in Rob Reiner's entertaining "A Few Good Men," adapted by Aaron Sorkin from his hit Broadway courtroom drama. 
Mr. Nicholson doesn't steal the film, which would mean that he somehow separates himself from everybody else in it. Rather, in the course of only a handful of scenes, he seems to suffuse the entire production, giving it a weight, density and point that might not otherwise be apparent. 
The role, beautifully written, is made to Mr. Nicholson's order. It's that of Col. Nathan R. Jessep of the United States Marine Corps, a tough, bigoted Vietnam veteran, a career officer shaped by decades of cold-war politics. By chance, Jessep is stationed in that last corner of the earth where the cold war goes on as if there were no yesterday. 
He's the commander of the marines stationed at the American naval base on the southwestern coast of Cuba at Guantanamo Bay, on a small bit of arid real estate protecting one of the best anchorages in the western Atlantic, a legacy of the Spanish-American War. It's there that the United States and Cuba, separated by barbed wire and command posts, have continued to co-exist through the Bay of Pigs invasion, the great missile crisis and a continuing, crippling economic embargo, in one of the strangest examples of symbiosis to be found in all of international relations. 
This geographic fact becomes a central image in the film adaptation, which gracefully opens up the story of a military court-martial without allowing the tension to evaporate. There are times when the movie seems to force-feed the audience essential information, and when the audience might well wonder whether the emotional crises of the defense lawyers really are of more interest than the fates of the two men on trial. 
Yet such things are built into the structure and nature of the drama, which is less about the workings of the military than about the mechanics of this particular inquiry. The story is this: in the course of what appears to be a hazing incident at Guantanamo, a Marine private has died, apparently poisoned by the rag stuffed into his throat before his mouth was taped. Two enlisted men are charged with the murder. As often happens during proceedings of this sort, the victim and the men on trial become less important than the politics surrounding the case. 
The Marine Corps would like to wrap it up as quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end, a hot-shot young naval lawyer, Lieut. (j.g.) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), is assigned to the defense with the understanding that he'll persuade the defendants to accept a plea bargain. Also assigned to the defense is Lieut. Comdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), who acts as Kaffee's conscience, eventually persuading him that there is a strong possibility that the two enlisted men were, in fact, acting on orders from their officers. 
The investigation, initially undertaken by Kaffee with some reluctance, uncovers the fact that the victim, Pfc. William T. Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo), had for some time been trying to transfer out of his unit.  Also, that he had ignored both the Marine Corps code and its chain of command. He had written letters to Washington offering to testify that he had witnessed an incident in which a member of his unit had arbitrarily fired on a Cuban watchtower near the base. 
As the investigation continues, Kaffee and Galloway, who clearly never go to the movies, read a book or spend much time talking to career service personnel, are surprised to discover a kind of military mind that, to them, seems prehistoric. The two defendants at first behave like automatons.  Pfc. Louden Downey (James Marshall) is so taciturn that he seems seriously retarded. His co-defendant and spokesman, Lance Cpl. Harold W. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison), refuses all offers of help. He will stoically accept whatever punishment is meted out. The two men simply parrot the Marines' code of fidelity to unit, corps, God and country. 
On a fact-finding trip to Guantanamo, Kaffee, Galloway and their assistant Lieut. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) have their first brush with Jessep at a scary lunch, during which the colonel cheerfully lies through his teeth. For Galloway's benefit, he also describes the special kind of high one can get when having sex with a superior officer. According to Jessep, that's one of the few benefits of an integrated service. 
"A Few Good Men" doesn't pack the surprises of "Witness for the Prosecution," nor does it probe very deeply into the psyche of men who exercise the power of dictators in a society that congratulates itself on its freedoms. It's no "Full-Metal Jacket." "A Few Good Men" recalls something of "The Caine Mutiny Court Martial," though it is most troubling not for the questions it raises, but for the casual way it finally treats its two lost, utterly bewildered defendants. 
The screenplay is a good one, directed with care and acted, for the most part, with terrific conviction.  Among the supporting players who do exceptional work are Kiefer Sutherland, as a Marine officer who is a Jessep in the making; J. T. Walsh, as an officer fatally flawed by conscience; Kevin Bacon, who appears as the military prosecutor, and Mr. Bodison, a new young actor whose performance as the more prominent defendant gives the film its melancholy shock value. 
Mr. Cruise, Ms. Moore and Mr. Pollak are perfectly adequate in less flashy roles, which, unlike the others, appear to have been constructed to keep the plot moving right along. They have to play it comparatively straight, which must be maddening when the actors around them are having such a colorful time. 
Mr. Nicholson is in his own league. His Jessep is both a joy to watch because of the actor's skill, and an explanation of why the United States base at Guantanamo Bay, whatever its military value, continues to exist.  "A Few Good Men" is a big commercial entertainment of unusually satisfying order. 
"A Few Good Men," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some violence.

‽The Muppet Christmas Carol‽,‽"The Muppet Christmas Carol" is not one of those clever children's films that keep adult escorts from gazing longingly at the exit signs. What you expect -- Muppets -- is pretty much what you get. There's no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there    is    a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand. 
Michael Caine stars as Scrooge, playing the role enthusiastically and well. (It can't have been easy to smile tearfully and sing "wherever you find love it feels like Christmas" in the midst of a Muppet crowd.) But when this film's target audience watches the opening credits, don't be surprised if Fozzie Bear gets a bigger hand than any grown-up could. The Muppets, undertaking their first major acting assignment, are so scene-stealing that when they turn up within the familiar story they assume the status of celebrity guests. The Great Gonzo narrates the film as Charles Dickens, and that suspiciously green-looking Bob Cratchit is Kermit the Frog. 
There's some degree of suspense in wondering whether Mrs. Cratchit, who does not appear until late in the film, will be played by you-know-who. Miss Piggy (who is of course here) deserves to turn up in a Muppet "Madame Bovary" some day, but that's another story. In this one, some fancy special effects are also used to heighten the audience appeal of the original material, so that Scrooge flies a la Superman when he returns to his childhood with the Ghost of Christmas Past. As many past generations have known, the story works just fine without such tricks. But this version strives to be elaborate, even in the design of its ghosts: Christmas Past is a small, eerie, wide-eyed nymph and Christmas Present a chortling giant. 
Songs for this musical version of Dickens's cautionary tale have been provided by Paul Williams. But the music is seldom memorable, and the labored lyrics may go over young audiences' heads. (A lonely life "paints you with indifference like a lady paints with rouge," Mr. Williams writes, trying to rhyme "Scrooge").  Much of the music is also on the saccharine side, but little children should like that reasonably well, just as they enjoy crowd scenes featuring Muppet vegetables and other talking toys. Val Strazovec's production design offers a droll collection of snowy English rooftops and atmospheric street scenes. 
"The Muppet Christmas Carol" was co-produced and capably directed by Brian Henson, whose supervision of puppetry and special effects keeps the film on a par with earlier Muppet efforts. The screenplay, by Jerry Juhl, is less inventive, but then it must cope with the challenge of retelling Dickens in terms that will register with young children. In this regard the film does work well, bringing home the story's impact and reinforcing its central message. Even if it takes two dancing black-and-white Muppet Marleys, a passel of quill-wielding rats as Scrooge's office clerks and a collection of young frogs and pigs in the Cratchit household, this "Christmas Carol" makes a clear case for kindness and successfully warms the heart.

‽The Distinguished Gentleman‽,‽WHEN first seen in "The Distinguished Gentleman," Thomas Jefferson Johnson (Eddie Murphy) is making his way through a crowd of well-heeled Floridians at a political fund-raiser. His is the only black face in an otherwise pink and white sea of earnest contributors. In quick succession he is taken for, or passes himself off as, a waiter, a guest, an F.B.I. agent. In fact he is a small-time con artist whose most successful scam to date has been a phone-sex service: Girls of Many Nations (1-800-555-NATO), the point of which is to obtain the names and addresses of johns to be shaken down at a later date. 
Thomas's initial brush with politics is instructive. It opens his eyes to the rewards of big-time scamming in what's sometimes called the political arena. Before you have time to note the mechanics of the film, which moves with the speed and the purpose of a game of three-card monte, Thomas has got himself elected to the House of Representatives. Among his freshman colleagues: a television weather forecaster and a former football player of some regional fame. 
Thomas is a junior member of Congress, but it takes him no more than four days to secure an appointment to the prestigious House Power and Industry Committee, where the pay-offs are large and nonstop.  Thomas is on his way. 
As written by Marty Kaplan and directed by Jonathan Lynn, the sly Englishman responsible for "My Cousin Vinny" and "Nuns on the Run," "The Distinguished Gentleman" is an easy, breezy romp of a movie, a low comedy of highly entertaining order. As it tells of the meteoric rise (and magical salvation of) Thomas Jefferson Johnson, the film even manages to kid the flimsy comic conventions it so carefully observes. 
"The Distinguished Gentleman" isn't to be confused with Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," though the leading characters in both films share a nominal fondness for the same Founding Father.  That fondness is supposed to be sincere in the Capra classic. In "The Distinguished Gentleman," it's the basis for a succession of jokes. The new movie owes nothing to Capra and everything to Mr. Murphy's earlier days on "Saturday Night Live" as one of television's greatest revue artists. Though it has a coherent narrative and continuing characters, "The Distinguished Gentleman" has the random, off-the-wall charm of a series of black-out sketches: short, often manic dramatic inventions in which reason is turned inside out and no pieties are safe. Take the montage in which Thomas and his aides, the same crew that helped him run his phone-sex business, start a telephone campaign to persuade the right Washington people that Thomas should be on the Power and Industry Committee. 
Mr. Murphy's Thomas is a genius on the telephone, as easily adopting the vocal inflections of a clenched-jaw Connecticut accent as those of a fellow who sounds as if he were the ghost of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Murphy's Yiddish accent isn't great but, in these loose and scatterbrained circumstances, it will do. 
There is something contagious as well as hilarious about Thomas's delight when, once he's in the Washington swing, he becomes the recipient of so many perks. He listens sympathetically as a lobbyist tells him that automatic weapons have been given a bad rap. But even Thomas is surprised when, sharing a blind with some M16-carrying duck hunters, only one bird is bagged. Thomas's comment: "It must have had a heart attack." 
The star is surrounded by a group of equally inventive and tireless supporting actors. Sheryl Lee Ralph, memorably funny as Robert De Niro's outspoken mistress in "Mistress," is a joy as Loretta, Thomas's helpful cousin who works as the entire stable of telephone sweethearts for his phone-sex business. Lane Smith, the courtly prosecuting attorney in "My Cousin Vinny," plays the crooked chairman of the Power and Industry Committee. He's a white politician who recognizes the value in Thomas's widest, toothiest, most unthreatening grin, which is pretty much the reason Thomas is allowed to sit on the committee. 
Joe Don Baker, Kevin McCarthy and Grant Shaud appear as some of the other less than noble political types. Sarah Carson doesn't have a large role, but she is not easily forgotten as the beautiful, frosty young white woman who more than lives up to her job description ("consummate public servant"). Victoria Rowell plays the sweetly committed young black woman who threatens to make Thomas into an honest man. 
"The Distinguished Gentleman" is not as subversive as Mr. Murphy's recent "Boomerang." In that film, you remember, he plays an unrepentant male chauvinist in a yuppie world as exclusively black as it is exclusively white in almost every other movie. "The Distinguished Gentleman" isn't quite as adventurous, and certainly not as romantic. Instead, it reflects a mostly integrated world, much like the one that television sitcoms see all around them, though few sitcoms have the wit or edge Mr. Lynn brings to this movie. 
"The Distinguished Gentleman," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some sexual situations.

‽The Bodyguard‽,‽Deep inside the vague, unfocused excesses of "The Bodyguard," the tale of a buttoned-down security agent hired to protect a glamorous pop star, there lurks the potential for a compelling film noir. Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), the bodyguard of the title, could have been a loner in a last-chance profession, terminally alienated from his own past. Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), the glittery singer, could have been drawn tantalizingly as both treacherous vixen and damsel in distress. Rachel could have been dangerously ready to confuse Frank's brand of peace and protection with love. Frank could have fallen, and fallen hard. 
And Rachel's household of hangers-on could have provided a full supply of trouble. On the surface, all her minions -- including a sly publicity agent (Gary Kemp), a senior aide (Bill Cobbs), an oafish security chief (Mike Starr) and a music executive who is also Rachel's sister (Michele Lamar Richards), toady ceaselessly and devote body and soul to insuring Rachel's happiness. But at least one of them also wants her dead. 
As written by Lawrence Kasdan in the mid-1970's, well before his "Body Heat" days, "The Bodyguard" could have capitalized on a mood of mystery and on the dark elements within each principal character. Handled thus, it might have made a lean romantic thriller instead of the long, sprawling semi-travelogue it has become. Mick Jackson, the director of "L.A. Story," has placed the emphasis on the least interesting aspect of this material: the pampered existence of Hollywood royalty, as manifested by countless swimming-pool shots and much attention to grandiose architecture. (The home of William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies is used prominently.) While this is worth something in terms of pure voyeurism, it seldom does much to advance the film's slender story. 
The viewer quickly discovers that Frank Farmer has a tragic flaw: as a Secret Service agent, he was otherwise engaged (actually, at his mother's funeral) on the day President Ronald Reagan was shot and has never forgiven himself for this "lapse." Unaccountably, a sense of failure has led Frank to highly paid work in the private sector, which leaves his Secret Service friends feeling very jealous indeed. 
As the film begins, Frank is hired to guard Rachel, who has received death threats, so he must spend long hours visiting her mansion and watching her concert act. In one such appearance, with Rachel dressed in metal as a kind of Mrs. Ben Hur, Frank becomes so apprehensive about the fans that he uses a fire extinguisher to keep them peaceful. It is from this sort of trumped-up action scene, interspersed with palmy glimpses of Rachel's privileged existence, that the film has been patched together. 
Romantic sparks between Frank and Rachel would have disguised much of the clumsiness, but those sparks are minimal. Sporting the close-cropped haircut he must have had in grade school, Mr. Costner plays Frank in the extremely muted, colorless style that befits Frank's job description. A similar restraint translated wonderfully into slow-burning sexual tension when Mr. Costner appeared in "No Way Out," but this time the effect is more wan. And as Frank, he spends a lot of time looking more watchful than the film's events really warrant. 
Ms. Houston, looking great and displaying the best set of teeth in movies, does better with Rachel's imperious side than with her gentler scenes.  Her character's self-absorption may be lifelike, but it doesn't do much for a love story. Two long hours and 10 minutes after this tale begins, Rachel and Frank seem no closer than seatmates on a long bus trip. It takes a dizzying 360-degree shot of them embracing, plus the swelling of the hit-bound soundtrack, to suggest any passion. 
"The Bodyguard" kills time with some memorably transparent gambits, like a startling leap from Miami to the snows near Lake Tahoe (where Ralph Waite ambles into the film as Frank's father) and a painfully poor facsimile of Academy Awards night.  It also pauses, though only briefly, for a couple of perfunctory love scenes between Rachel and Frank. Unreal as these scenes seem anyhow, they are further undercut by the film's failure even to notice that this is an interracial romance. Strangely enough, "The Bodyguard" comes from Warner Brothers, the studio that just released "Malcolm X." 
The sidelines of "The Bodyguard" are enlivened by Mr. Kasdan's occasionally deft zingers (including the perfect rejoinder to a party pickup line), by moments when Mr. Costner's wariness takes on some dramatic edge and by supporting performances geared to a film noir sensibility. Mr. Kemp, a sinister star of "The Krays," and Ms. Richards are particularly strong reminders of what might have been. 
"The Bodyguard" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes discreet sexual situations, mild profanity and slight violence.

‽Home Alone 2: Lost in New York‽,‽IF "Home Alone 2," the by-the-numbers sequel to the third-biggest hit in movie history, is viewed as a learning experience, its first lesson is that originality is a dangerous thing. Its second, aimed at any child who ever dreamed of drinking Coca-Cola out of a Champagne glass, is that malicious mischief can be construed as no-fault fun. Its third, and most interesting, inadvertent notion is that time does not stand still, no matter how profitable it might be to think otherwise. Between this film and its seemingly very similar predecessor, there is all the difference in the world. 
"Home Alone" became a hit by speaking to secret wishes any child could understand: the desire for independence, the novelty of feeling empowered, the triumph of defending one's castle against invading hordes, or at least against two cartoonish bozos. No one could have predicted that these messages would come through quite so loud and clear, or be presented as so much fun. 
And no one could have suggested, even in an age of slavish sequels, that the formula be replicated outright this time. So "Home Alone" moves to New York City, and does its best both to ignore and exploit this change of scene. But it also changes direction in another way: a film bursting with enthusiasm for a fresh, appealing fantasy has been replaced by one most eager to maintain the status quo. 
This film's only real show of ingenuity comes with its explanation of how Kevin McCallister (of course played by the one-boy box-office phenomenon, Macaulay Culkin) gets to New York in the first place. In establishing this, it actually toys with the audience's expectation of a carbon copy. Once again, the McCallister clan is seen getting ready for a vacation from their outsized suburban dream house, which was a small but significant factor in the first film's fantasy appeal. 
Once again, an alarm clock fails. And once again Kevin is threatened with the possibility of sleeping in the attic, where he was left behind last time. After thus nudging viewers in the ribs, the film makers -- the director Chris Columbus and the writer and mastermind John Hughes -- let Kevin get as far as the airport, where a man wearing clothes like Kevin's father's accidentally leads the boy astray. It takes only a few more wild coincidences to land the film's wide-eyed hero in Manhattan, a setting that is treated by "Home Alone 2" as a holiday gift. It's a long time since a film regarded New York with the wide-eyed, touristy wonder that is evident here. 
The mood is as buoyant as it was the first time, and the story of Kevin's big-city adventures is certainly fun. But there's a difference between watching a previously unknown child actor finagle his way past a grocery clerk and seeing Mr. Culkin, this nation's most stellar little boy, booking himself a hotel suite and a white stretch limousine. The ante is raised when this boy's once-precocious confidence begins to seem like second nature, and when he moves on from the job of defending his parents' house to spending their money. 
A plot twist that has Kevin carrying his father's credit card en route to the airplane expedites the boy's big plans, as does his use of a tape recorder to lower his voice during telephone calls; that's how he makes travel plans. Look for similar tape recorders in toy stores as part of what will surely be the season's second biggest movie-merchandising coup (after "X"), and don't worry about missing the point. Much of "Home Alone 2" takes place in a toy store. 
But this film's home away from home is the Plaza Hotel, plugged so tirelessly that the screenplay works in an 800 number for reservations and a walk-on by Donald Trump. That setting is well used and well populated, thanks to a suspicious hotel staff led by Tim Curry, whose droll disapproval is transformed by Kevin's imagination into a seasonably Grinch-like vision. Rob Schneider and Dana Ivey give the film some lively comic moments by falling for Kevin's stupid-grown-up tricks. 
Those tricks are so similar to the first film's antics that some viewers may blink in disbelief. Again, Kevin tape-records movie dialogue from television and uses it to scare intruders; again, he constructs a dummy that casts an adult-looking silhouette. And again he matches wits, if that is the word, with the two hapless burglars who stalked him last time: Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), the two most birdbrained adult males who ever figured in a little boy's daydream. Once again, Kevin subjects Harry and Marv to terrible tortures in the name of fun. 
But Kevin does not happen to be defending his home this time. Indeed, the setup is so awkward that the boy and his pursuers wind up running from the Plaza to West 95th Street, just so they can play out the film's long-awaited endgame in an empty brownstone. It is here that Kevin throws bricks off the roof onto Marv's forehead, puts a staple through Marv's nose, sets Harry's hair on fire (in a stunt that turns particularly dangerous when Harry soaks his head in a kerosene-filled toilet), inflicts a series of spine-cracking injuries and otherwise works out his aggressive whims. 
Many children will find this funny, and many parents will not. It's much more violent than the first film's comparable set of dirty tricks. And Kevin, removed from his embattled home, seems much more cavalier, possibly even meaner than his bullying older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray). 
"Home Alone 2" may be lazily conceived, but it is staged with a sense of occasion and a lot of holiday cheer. The return of Mr. Culkin in this role is irresistible, even if this utterly natural comic actor has been given little new to do. Mr. Pesci and Mr. Stern bring great gusto to their characters' stupidity, to the point where they are far funnier just walking and talking than they are being hurt. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard give amusing reprises their earlier roles as Kevin's parents, and do some memorable squirming when asked to explain their child-losing mishap to the police. Kieran Culkin, playing Kevin's pesky little brother, is a reminder that this is a family to be reckoned with. And a snowy-haired Eddie Bracken fills much of the film's sentimentality quota as a toy mogul who loves to help sick children. 
The rest of that quota is taken care of by the estimable Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar as the mother in "My Left Foot" and brings surprising grace and stature to the role of a pigeon lady in Central Park. As an echo of the lonely old man played by Roberts Blossom in the first film, this character would be the most shameless element in this one; that is, if bits of John Williams's score didn't sound like "The Nutcracker," too. 
"Home Alone 2" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and considerable violence.

‽
‽Malcolm X‽,‽Malcolm X lived a dozen different lives, each in its way a defining aspect of the black American experience from nightmare to dream. There was never any in-between for the man who was initially called Malcolm Little, the son of a Nebraska preacher, and who, when he died, was known by his Muslim name, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm traveled far, through many incarnations to become as much admired as he was feared as the black liberation movement's most militant spokesman and unrelenting conscience. 
Malcolm was already something of a myth when he was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom in New York on Feb. 21, 1965, just three months short of his 40th birthday. The publication later that year of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," his remarkably vivid testament written with Alex Haley, eventually consolidated his position as a great American folk hero, someone whose life speaks with uncanny pertinence to succeeding generations, white as well as black. 
Taking the autobiography and a screenplay by Arnold Perl that was begun more than 20 years ago (Perl died in 1971), Spike Lee has attempted the impossible and almost brought it off. His new "Malcolm X" is not exactly the equal, or even the equivalent, of the book, but it's an ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization. 
"Malcolm X" will offend many people for all the wrong reasons. It is neither so inflammatory as Mr. Lee's statements about it would have you believe nor so comforting as might be wished by those who would call a halt to speculation concerning Malcolm's murder. It is full of color and exuberance as it tells of life on the streets in Boston and New York, but it grows increasingly austere when Malcolm is arrested for theft and sent to prison, where he finds his life's mission. The movie becomes proper, well mannered and somber, like Malcolm's dark suits and narrow ties, as it dramatizes his rise in the Nation of Islam, founded by Elijah Muhammad. 
Mr. Lee treats the Nation of Islam and its black separatist teachings seriously and, just as seriously, Malcolm's disillusionment when Elijah Muhammad's fondness for pretty young secretaries is revealed. When, after his split from the Nation of Islam, Malcolm goes on his pilgrimage to Mecca, the film celebrates his new insight into racial brotherhood, which makes his assassination all the more sorrowful. 
In the film's view, a god has been recognized, then lost. 
Mr. Lee means for "Malcolm X" to be an epic, and it is in its concerns and its physical scope. In Denzel Washington it also has a fine actor who does for "Malcolm X" what Ben Kingsley did for "Gandhi." Mr. Washington not only looks the part, but he also has the psychological heft, the intelligence and the reserve to give the film the dramatic excitement that isn't always apparent in the screenplay. 
This isn't a grave fault, nor is it singular. Biographical films, except those about romantic figures long since dead like "Lawrence of Arabia," carry with them responsibilities that tend to inhibit. Mr. Lee has not been inhibited so much as simultaneously awe struck and hard pressed. 
"Malcolm X" is frank about what it sees as the murder conspiracy, which involves a combination of people representing the Nation of Islam and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Yet in trying to cover Malcolm's life from his boyhood to his death, it sometimes seems more breathlessly desperate than cogently revealing. 
The movie picks up Malcolm's story in the 1940's on his arrival in wartime Boston as a bright but square teen-ager from rural Michigan. Malcolm eagerly falls in with the wrong crowd, initially represented by Shorty (Mr. Lee), a street hustler who shows him how to dress (a pearl gray zoot suit) and introduces him to the fast set at the Roseland Ballroom. Malcolm learns how to Lindy and how to wheel and deal. He discovers women and drugs. In addition to his attachment to Laura (Theresa Randle), a sweet young black woman, he develops a far steamier liaison with a thrill-seeking young white woman, Sophia, played by Kate Vernon, who looks a lot like Carroll Baker in her "Baby Doll" days. 
As the film moves forward from the 40's, it suffers spasms of flashbacks to Malcolm's childhood in Nebraska and Michigan. These are so fragmented that they may mean nothing to anyone who hasn't read the autobiography. They also don't do justice to the early experiences themselves, especially to Malcolm's time in a white foster home where he excelled in school and was encouraged by well-meaning adults who did not hesitate to refer to him as a "nigger." 
Mr. Lee is very good in his handling of individual sequences, but until very near the end, "Malcolm X" fails to acquire the momentum that makes everything that happens seem inevitable. The film goes on and on in a kind of reverential narrative monotone. 
The story of Malcolm X is fraught with pitfalls for any movie maker. Mr. Lee is creating a film about a man he admires for an audience that includes those who have a direct interest in the story, those who may not have an interest but know the details intimately and those who know nothing or only parts of the story. It's a tricky situation for anyone committed to both art and historical truth. 
Mr. Lee's method is almost self-effacing. He never appears to stand between the material and the audience. He himself does not preach. There are no carefully inserted speeches designed to tell the audience what it should think. He lets Malcolm speak and act for himself. The moments of confrontational melodrama, something for which Mr. Lee has a particular gift, are quite consciously underplayed. 
In this era of aggressive anti-intellectualism, the film's most controversial subtext might not even be recognized: Malcolm's increasing awareness of the importance of language in his struggle to raise black consciousness. Vaguely articulated feelings aren't enough. Ideas can be expressed only through a command of words. 
Before Mr. Lee came to the "Malcolm X" project, other people had worked on it. In addition to Perl's screenplay, there were adaptations by James Baldwin, David Mamet, Calder Willingham, David Bradley and Charles Fuller. In retrospect, it's easy to see what their difficulties might have been. 
Though the autobiography is full of characters and incidents, they are only peripheral to the larger story of Malcolm's awkward journey toward intellectual and spiritual enlightenment. Then too, Malcolm's life ended before the journey could be said to have been completed. This is not the sort of thing movies accommodate with ease. 
"Malcolm X" never bursts with the free-flowing energy of the director's own fiction, but that's a reflection of the genre, the subject and Mr. Lee's sense of mission. Though the film is being promoted with all sorts of merchandise on the order of T-shirts and baseball caps, the one item that promotes it best is the new book, "By Any Means Necessary: The Trials and Tribulations of the Making of 'Malcolm X,' " by Mr. Lee with Ralph Wiley, published by Hyperion. 
In addition to the screenplay, the book has an extensive report on the research Mr. Lee did before starting the production. Among the people he interviewed was the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, who succeeded Elijah Muhammad as the head of the Nation of Islam. It was apparently a polite encounter, but Mr. Lee remains sharp, skeptical and uninhibited. He's not a reporter to let anyone else have the last word. It's this sort liveliness that is most missed in the film. 
The real triumph of "Malcolm X" is that Mr. Lee was able to make it at all. As photographed by Ernest Dickerson and designed by Wynn Thomas, the movie looks as authentic as any David Lean epic. The large cast of featured players, including Al Freeman Jr., who plays Elijah Muhammad, and Angela Barrett, who plays Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz, is supplemented by, among others, Al Sharpton, Christopher Plummer, Bobby Seale, William Kunstler and Peter Boyle in cameo roles. 
Nelson Mandela, photographed in Soweto, appears at the end to speak a kind of benediction. 
"Malcolm X" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has vulgar language and some violence.

‽
‽Bram Stoker's Dracula‽,‽LITTLE did you suspect that the world has been dying for yet another film variation on "Dracula," Bram Stoker's classic of 19th-century gothic fiction. Yet Francis Ford Coppola's new extravaganza, suitably titled "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " to separate it from all others, is such a dizzy tour of movie-making forces that it comes close to overwhelming all reasonable doubts. 
Taking James V. Hart's unusually faithful screen adaptation of the novel, Mr. Coppola has created his own wild dream of a movie, which looks as if it required a special pact with the Treasury Department to finance. With its gorgeous sets and costumes, its hallucinogenic special effects and mad montages that recall the original grandeur of Abel Gance's "Napoleon," this "Dracula" transcends camp to become a testimonial to the glories of film making as an end in itself. 
That's all very well and good, you might say, but shouldn't movies, even Dracula movies, be about something? 
Not necessarily. This "Dracula" is most easily enjoyed if you don't search too hard for meanings, at least for those that go beyond the idea that the Stoker novel is really about Victorian England's fear of unleashed female sexuality. Interpretations can be fun, but they are also misleading. "Nosferatu," F. W. Murnau's unauthorized 1922 adaptation of the Stoker novel, is a silent-screen classic, but it is seen by many to be anti-Semitic. Tod Browning's 1931 "Dracula," starring Bela Lugosi, is about nothing whatsoever. It's watchable today mostly as a footnote to the career of the man who also made "Freaks" and "The Devil Doll." 
Mr. Coppola's version looks like something that he might have imagined nearly 30 years ago, when he wrote and directed his first film, "Dementia 13," a tepid black-and-white horror movie made for about $12 and change. "Dracula" has the nervy enthusiasm of the work of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master's command of his craft. It's surprising, entertaining and always just a little too much. 
Though set mostly in 1897 London and Transylvania, Mr. Hart's screenplay covers not only what's in the original novel but also what Stoker saw fit to omit. 
This includes the film's vivid precredit sequence in Transylvania shortly after Constaninople's fall to the Turks in 1462. Dracula (Gary Oldman), the bravest knight in all Transylvania, goes mad with grief when his young wife, Elisabeta (Winona Ryder), tricked into suicide by the fiendish Turks, is denied a Christian burial. The young count curses God and stabs the sacred cross, which begins to bleed the first of the buckets of stage blood with which this film is awash. It's never clear just how or why Dracula's vampirism results from this outrage, but dramatic coherence isn't as important as style. 
Mr. Oldman's Dracula comes in all sizes and shapes. When first seen after the opening credits, he is an ancient, bloodless fellow welcoming Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), a young English solicitor who has come to Transylvania to help the old count in his plans to move to London. At another time he is a hairy incubus who ravishes a London society girl in a magnificent Victorian garden in the middle of the night. He also appears as the Devil, as a wolf, as a lizard, as mist. Most important, he turns up as a reincarnated, dandyish version of his younger self. 
That is when he's in London, courting the innocent Mina (Miss Ryder), Jonathan Harker's fiancee, who, by chance, is the reincarnated, long-dead Elisabeta. They meet on a London street in broad daylight. The movie doesn't devote a lot of time to the laws governing vampires and vampirism, but it does point out that the notion that vampires can't stand the light of day is poppycock. It also seems that there are times when a holy cross is of no more use against an attacking vampire than a rolled-up umbrella. 
The narrative of the film, like that of the novel, defies rational synopsis but, in addition to Jonathan, Mina and, of course, the thirsty count, it also involves Mina's best friend, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), an early and quite willing victim of the count in London. She's the sort of Victorian maiden who owns a copy of Sir Richard Francis Burton's privately printed English translation of the "Arabian Nights," unexpurgated and illustrated. 
There's also the brilliant if eccentric Prof. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), the noted vampire specialist, who is called in when it's clear to Lucy's doctor that his patient's failing health is something more than chronic flu. Tom Waits appears as Renfield, the solicitor who goes out to Transylvania before Jonathan and returns quite out of his mind with an insatiable appetite for insects. 
The movie proceeds in the feverish manner of one of Dracula's victims just before he crosses over into the land of the undead. Nights seldom fall that a great storm doesn't erupt. One scene is never completed before another begins, necessitating lots of crosscutting between various simultaneous actions. In this way Mr. Coppola finds equivalents to unhinged minds without ever losing his own. 
When the very proper Jonathan, trying to get some sleep in the castle, is seduced by Dracula's undead brides, they surface up through the mattress, bare-breasted and ravenous. Catching his brides feeding on his guest, Dracula is furious. "That man is mine," he says, luring the women away with the gift of a peasant baby. It's as if Mr. Coppola were saying: "You want a horror film? You got a horror film." 
In the film's most Gance-like montage, covering Dracula's journey to London during yet another storm, the movie crosscuts between Dracula as he changes into some new being, Lucy's being sexually attacked in her garden while Mina watches, and the crazy Renfield in his lunatic asylum. Coherence is beguiled, temporarily anyway. 
The film's most brilliant invention is an eerie sequence set in a London nickelodeon where, don't ask me why, Mina is suddenly stalked by a wolf, which, at Dracula's direction, becomes a docile, loving puppy. It's amazing how long Mr. Coppola can keep this up. 
The principal actors are all fine. Mr. Oldman, Ms. Ryder, Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Reeves and Ms. Frost, a new and very bright-eyed actress, behave with a grace and an affectation that fits the time. The anachronisms are not glaring. Among Mr. Coppola's other colleagues who deserve special mention are Michael Ballhaus, the cinematographer; Thomas Sanders, the production designer, and Eiko Ishioka, who designed the fantastic costumes. 
In a movie of such over-the-top frenzy and opulence, however, performances and people do not stand out as much as the kaleidoscopic results. This movie was imagined, written and directed, then somehow engineered into being as if it were one long, uninterrupted special effect. 
For the most part Mr. Coppola avoids camp humor, though Grand Guignol jokes are in order. "You mean you're going to conduct a post-mortem?" someone says tearfully of a vampire victim, as if to suggest that the victim has already suffered enough. "Not exactly," says Van Helsing. "I just want to cut off the head and take out the heart." 
"Dracula" works well as long as it remains a show. Late in the narrative, possibly to give it some kind of philosophical basis, the director sort of nudges the audience to make analogies between AIDS and vampirism. The film is full of close-ups of horrible things seen so closely that you can't be sure of their exact identity, but there's no doubt about the shots of what are intended to be blood cells. It's not funny. According to the gospel of Bram Stoker, only divine intervention can save Dracula's victims. 
One safer way to interpret "Dracula" is to say that it's about a man disconnected from the world on which he remains dependent. That also has appeared to be the director's problem for some time. After "Apocalypse Now," everything Mr. Coppola touched seemed a bit puny, either light of weight or more technically innovative than emotionally involving. With "Dracula" it's apparent that Mr. Coppola's talent and exuberance survive. 
"Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of blood, violence, female nudity and sexual situations.

‽The Thing Called Love‽,‽''Look out, Music City, 'cause I'm here now, and I ain't never leavin'!'' an aspiring country singer with the potent name of Miranda Presley (Samantha Mathis) whoops into the night from a Nashville rooftop early in ''The Thing Called Love.'' Her exultant shouts distill the optimistic down-home spirit of this cheery but trivial 1993 movie, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, about guitar-toting hopefuls converging on the country music capital at a moment when (thanks to Garth Brooks) the music was enjoying a huge spurt of popularity. 
Watching this mildly engaging, formulaic film, you can imagine how it was pitched as a can't-miss early 90's fusion of ''Nashville'' and ''Urban Cowboy,'' with a sure-fire soundtrack album tie-in. Not only would it revive the director's sagging career, it would be just the vehicle to propel its male lead, River Phoenix, into the stratosphere alongside John Travolta. 
Well, so much for Hollywood fantasies. After ''The Thing Called Love'' fared disappointingly at the box office in some regional dates, it went straight to video. It also turned out to be the last completed feature film for the star, who died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993. Six years later it is having its New York theatrical premiere, today at Anthology Film Archives. 
''The Thing Called Love'' begins promisingly, as Miranda arrives in Nashville by Greyhound from New York just minutes too late to participate in weekly auditions for a Saturday night showcase at the legendary Bluebird Cafe. While hanging around the place, however, she falls in with two other hopefuls, best friends and fellow musicians James Wright (Mr. Phoenix) and Kyle Davidson (Dermot Mulroney), both of whom develop instant crushes on her. 
Miranda also befriends Linda Lue Linden (Sandra Bullock), a marginally talented singer-songwriter who obviously doesn't have what it takes to be a country star. Linda Lue, who eventually decides to enter a local beauty contest, invites Miranda to be her motel roommate. Miranda takes a job as a waitress at the cafe, where she is watched over by its crusty but good-hearted proprietor, Lucy (the country singer K. T. Oslin). 
Although well acted, with early scenes that deftly sketch the atmosphere, the movie, written by Carol Heikkinen, never takes off. Instead of seriously exploring Nashville's music world and concentrating on Miranda's struggle to succeed, the screenplay throws her into a listless triangle with James and Kyle. Since Miranda seems hardheaded and  commonsensical most of the time, her impulsive marriage to the selfish, manipulative James is unconvincing. Meanwhile, Kyle, an inept daredevil prone to injuring himself in showoff stunts, mopes around until an inevitable showdown brings the two friends to blows. The tacked-on feel-good ending is utterly false. 
Mr. Phoenix, who has outgrown his boyish ingenuousness in this film, strikes some sparks as a spoiled, hotheaded rising star whose charm curdles into a glowering sulk the instant he doesn't get his way. But it is finally not a star-making performance. Mr. Phoenix even gets to sing one of his own songs in the film, the  mediocre ''Lone Star State of Mind.'' Somebody was smart enough to realize that such fare could never climb any chart. That's why James's career-launching hit, ''Until Now,'' was written and sung in the movie by someone else, namely Rodney Crowell. 
''The Thing Called Love'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

‽Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould‽,‽In the control room of a recording studio, the engineers discuss the merits of taking cream in their coffee, only half-noticing the enraptured figure behind the soundproof glass. There, Glenn Gould (Colm Feore) begins by casually testing his blood pressure, then listens to a playback of his recording of Bach. To the sounds of the English Suite No. 2, he begins swaying and floating in the throes of esthetic ecstasy, his white shirt billowing in gravity-defying slow motion. Far removed from the engineers' prosaic talk, he seems truly to have passed into another dimension. 
The audience for "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould," a brilliant and transfixing cinematic portrait by Francois Girard, can look forward to enjoying much the same sensation. For an hour and a half, without repeating himself or resorting to tactics that are even slightly familiar, Mr. Girard, whose film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, thoughtfully holds the viewer in thrall. 
Though it glancingly incorporates a great deal of biographical information, this carefully measured film does not choose to describe Gould in ordinary terms. Suffused as it is with the artist's musical sensibility, it doesn't even have to show him playing the piano. Instead, Mr. Girard explores and replicates his subject's eccentric thought processes in a remarkably visceral way, drawing the audience palpably into Gould's state of mind. This film works hypnotically, with great subtlety and grace, in ways that are gratifyingly consistent with Gould's own thoughts about his music and his life. 
Mr. Girard's film is indeed a compilation of 32 glimpses, each of them instantly intelligible, some of them strung together in supremely delicate ways. The format makes dependable sense: this is hardly the first time the variations motif has been brought to bear in describing Gould. More than an homage to his triumphant recordings of Bach's "Goldberg" Variations, this multifaceted structure seems the only possible means of approaching such a complex individual. If it sounds defiantly arty, that suits the subject and his "academic owlishness" (in the words of his biographer Otto Friedrich) perfectly. If it sounds obscure and daunting, it most certainly is not. 
If anything, "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould" should prove even more mesmerizing to those who know little about Gould's life than to those aware that he really did have tastes for ketchup, tranquilizers, arrowroot cookies and Petula Clark (not necessarily in that order).  In its own quirky way, it assembles a surprisingly rigorous and illuminating portrait of the man. Defying any usual constraints of narrative or chronology, Mr. Girard can leap freely from Gould's boyhood to his mature work, from the hotel room to the concert stage, from the raptures of the music to silly questions asked by the press. The individual fragments are so meticulously realized that the whole becomes much greater than the sum of its parts. 
Typically fascinating is "L.A. Concert," a fine example of how cannily Mr. Girard can present the facts of Gould's life. We first see the pianist backstage, poised over a sink, soaking his arms in steaming water five minutes before a concert is to begin.  Pill bottles are conspicuously arrayed in front of him. Called to the stage, he next appears dressed and ready, maintaining a serene detachment as an aide tries to instruct him about the irritating show-business realities of the evening. Just before reaching the stage, he pauses to talk with a stagehand and winds up signing a program for the man. Only when the stagehand examines the autograph does he learn that Mr. Gould has decided to make this 1964 concert performance his last. 
It would be difficult to think of a more adroit, economical way to convey all this information in a such relatively brief time. "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould," which was written by Mr. Girard with Don McKellar, is also able to fuse the informative with the poetic, particularly in the passages that deal hauntingly with Gould's final days. (He died at 50, in 1982.) One of the film's last images is of a Voyager satellite that went into space carrying aural souvenirs of Earth's culture, including Gould's recording of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier." The film's announcement that the two Voyager spacecraft left our solar system in 1987 and 1989, respectively, suits its lingering impression that Gould was never quite of this world. 
Mr. Feore, a Canadian stage actor, does not overwhelmingly resemble Gould, but he becomes a commanding and believable presence all the same. With a voice that has been made to sound strangely disembodied, and with the ability to project brooding, playful intelligence, Mr. Feore enhances the film's sense of deep mystery. Equally lulling and seductive are Mr. Girard's fluid camera movements, which enable the film to prowl and survey with uncommon ease. In the end, his methods induce a complete and satisfying immersion into his many-faceted subject. 
Among the individual glimpses that must be mentioned here: "Practice," in which Gould resonates to his own thrilling impression of Beethoven's "Tempest" Sonata without ever touching a keyboard; "Truck Stop," in which he hears and seems to orchestrate the voices of people around him; "Personal Ad," in which he toys with the language of the lovelorn, then chuckles at the thought of ever representing himself in that way; "Diary of One Day," a stunning compilation of formulas, medical notations, heartbeats and detailed X-rays of a person playing the piano. Even before the film reaches this last juncture, you will know that the heart and blood of the pianist have been captured on screen. 
Also worth noting: some significant omissions. Mr. Girard knew better than to mention Gould's intense admiration for Barbra Streisand, or to use those sections of the "Goldberg" Variations that have powerfully evoked Dr. Hannibal Lecter ever since they were used to shocking effect in "The Silence of the Lambs." 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould

‽Sankofa‽,‽In "Sankofa," a contemporary African-American woman travels back in time and experiences slavery. Haile Gerima's poetic and precisely detailed film takes its audience into its heroine's life and mind as her moral sense is challenged and changed. No viewer can avoid the discomforting questions the film so eloquently raises. 
The opening sequences, set and filmed in Ghana, are alternately seductive and off-putting. Among drums and chants, a voice invokes ancestral ghosts. "Spirit of the dead, rise up," the voice says, "and claim your story." The film's title is a West African term meaning to reclaim the past in order to go forward, and "Sankofa" stumbles only in its depiction of the present. 
Mona is a young model first seen posing for a callous white photographer on a beach. She is dressed in a pseudo-Tina Turner getup complete with blonde wig. This is a heavy-handed way of showing that she has lost her connection to her past, that slavery still shapes her life as she is enslaved by contemporary images. 
But the film soon moves on, convincingly, to a surreal experience. Mona wanders into a dungeon, a holding place from which slaves were shipped to the United States. She has walked into the past, where she is stripped, chained and beaten. Suddenly she is on a plantation, a house slave called Shola, with no memory of Mona or the 20th century. 
The longest and finest part of "Sankofa" is its depiction of the daily life of the slaves and the way witnessing its brutality changes Shola. She falls in love with a rebellious field slave, who urges her to poison her white owners. Shola refuses. Though the master rapes her at will, she believes killing is wrong, no matter what injustice has been done to her. 
But Shola soon sees a pregnant runaway slave beaten to death, her living child taken from her body. And she idolizes Nunu, a strong and motherly slave who has joined the rebels. 
Nunu's son, Joe, is the head slave, who has an easier life and seems to have turned against his own people. He is blue-eyed and in the thrall of the white priest, and his story should have been as compelling as Shola's. But his character is less convincing, partly because his tortured sense of identity is so often depicted by sudden mood swings and glances at paintings of white Madonnas in church. 
Shola, however, (played with great strength by Oyafunmike Ogunlano) carries the audience into the heart of her experience. When she lifts a machete over a sleeping white overseer, the film has led its viewers to a place where either choice -- to kill or not -- might be justified. "Sankofa" asks its audience to enter a different moral universe, one that slavery created. 
Mr. Gerima is an Ethiopian-born film maker who has lived in the United States for decades and teaches at Howard University. His film is ambitious in its depiction of slavery and accomplished in its visual command, from the bright red scarves of the rebellious slaves to a fire they set in the fields. 
"Sankofa" opens today at the Harlem Victoria 5 Theater. Engrossing and provocative, it sends Shola back to the present as Mona, and sends viewers along with her. Armed with visceral new knowledge, she can make of it what she will.

‽Ghost in the Machine‽,‽"Ghost in the Machine" is the kind of movie in which a curling iron, a garbage disposal and a dishwasher become potential murder weapons. The explanation will thrill technophobes: a serial killer dies during a lightning storm and his soul seeps from the hospital's X-ray scanner into a mainframe computer. From there he roams through Ohio's electrical system, ejecting videos from VCR's at will and terrorizing Terry Munroe (Karen Allen) and her 13-year-old son, Josh (Wil Horneff). 
Considering that premise, the film should have been a lot wackier. Although "Ghost in the Machine" opened yesterday without advance screenings (the surest sign of trouble), the movie is not a disaster. It is a competent, occasionally witty genre piece that never tries to be anything more. 
It's no mistake that the story begins with a house that looks suspiciously as if it belongs on Elm Street, and ominous music that suggests Freddy Krueger has come to town. The director is Rachel Talalay, who produced two of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies and directed the last one, "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare." 
"Ghost in the Machine" echoes Freddy's weird ability to creep into supposedly safe places. Here it's the telephone instead of your dreams, but the premise is the same. So is the film's rhythm. Viewers know the computer killer will stike and sometimes even who is up for grabs. (When a sexy teen-age baby sitter appears in "Ghost in the Machine," she's obviously a goner.) The question is when and how, and the best moments in "Ghost in the Machine" have fun playing with that question. Choosing his victims from Terry's address book, the killer first attacks her boss with a lethal microwave that invades the entire kitchen. First the popcorn on the counter pops; then a banana explodes; then the boss's face begins to pop, too. 
The film isn't sharp enough to make its premise seem new, though. It has trouble juggling all the things it tries to be: a special-effects movie filled with computer graphics; a high-tech slasher film; a joke. But its real shortcoming is that it doesn't have the haunting resonance of the "Elm Street" series. A killer who enters dreams is one thing; a killer who plays with the electric swimming-pool cover doesn't have quite the same claim on the unconscious. 
"Ghost in the Machine" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, some of it not computer generated. Ghost in the Machine

‽Batman: Mask of the Phantasm‽,‽"You're harder to kill than a cockroach on steroids," complains the Joker to Batman after a brutal clash from which the Caped Crusader emerges miraculously unscathed. 
"Is my shirt too big or is my flesh crawling?" quips another character in "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm," the movie spinoff of the animated television series. 
"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm," is heavily larded with sarcastic remarks whose tone of 90's cynicism clashes jarringly with the film's sleek 1940's ambiance. That discontinuity is the least of the many problems afflicting the movie, which opened locally on Christmas Day. 
Set in the 1940's, "Mask of the Phantasm" is a cartoon film noir evocation of events that purport to explain the origins of Batman. In convoluted flashbacks, it portrays a star-crossed love affair between Bruce Wayne, the reclusive millionaire who is Batman's alter ego and Andrea Beaumont, a beautiful banker's daughter who suggests a svelte hybrid of Lauren Bacall and Veronica Lake. 
After the violent deaths of Bruce's parents, Andrea's love enables him to give up his vow to avenge the killings. But when she abruptly breaks off their engagement and disappears with her father, the Caped Crusader is born out of the emptiness and disillusionment. In solving a series of murders of aging mobsters, Batman discovers that Andrea and her father are caught up in a web of international loansharking. The killer, with whom Batman does battle, is a sinister caped figure who looks so much like him that he finds himself a prime suspect. 
With its pointed, cavernous backgrounds and a Gotham City setting that evokes a 1940's-style futurism, "Mask of the Phantasm" looks splendid. But its story is too complicated and the editing too jerky for the movie to achieve narrative coherence. And the resemblance between the movie's hero and its enigmatic arch-villain is so close that audiences are likely to be confused. 
The actor's voices may suit animated television characters, but on a large screen Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker, and Dana Delany's Andrea sound flat and one-dimensional. Shirley Walker's overblown score floods the movie with choral bombast that only points up an absence of anything remotely gripping. 
The movie is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has violent scenes.  Batman Mask of the Phantasm  Directed by Eric Radomski and Bruce W.

‽Tombstone‽,‽The Old West has rarely looked as opulent as it does in "Tombstone," the director George P. Cosmatos's retelling of the Wyatt Earp story. In this capacious western with many modern touches, the Arizona boom town and site of the legendary O.K. Corral has a seedy, vaudevillian grandeur that makes it a direct forerunner of Las Vegas. 
The streets may be dusty, but they are very wide. The gambling halls and theaters have a gilt-edged Victorian glamour that contrasts sharply with the shoot-'em-up exuberance of patrons who when roused to enthusiasm are liable to fire their guns into the air. And in time-honored nouveau-riche style, the affluent citizens of a city made rich from silver enjoy dressing to the nines. 
"Tombstone," which opens tomorrow, is as up-to-date in its political consciousness as it is visually spiffy. When Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) arrives in Tombstone from Dodge City, hoping to start a business and live peacefully, he bears the weight heavily of having once killed people in his line of duty as a peace officer. It takes a lot of prodding before he reluctantly pins on a marshal's badge and pursues the cowboy gang that is terrorizing the town. 
That gang of more than 30 is explicitly compared to a modern-day crime syndicate in Kevin Jarre's self-consciously up-to-date screenplay. Led by the evil Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), an outlaw who is described as wanting "revenge for being born," it even includes one Old West homosexual, a character nicknamed "Sister Boy" (Jason Priestley). The screenplay also takes pains to establish the existence of an Asian population in Tombstone that is discriminated against. 
The film has a very contemporary attitude toward alcohol and drug abuse. Although Wyatt's best friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), executes a number of heroic deeds, throughout the film he is a jaundiced, perspiring wreck who is clearly drinking himself to death. Twice during the film, he collapses from what appears to be liver failure and coughs up blood. Wyatt's wife, Mattie (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), who suffers from recurrent headaches, is addicted to laudanum. A wild-eyed wraith, subject to intense mood swings, she is by turns scary and pitiful. 
The movie's most modern psychological touch is its depiction of Josephine (Dana Delany), the itinerant actress with whom Wyatt falls in love at first sight, as the most casually and comfortably liberated woman ever to set foot in 1880's Arizona. In their first conversation, Josephine intimidates Wyatt with philosophical questions like "Are you happy?" and "What do you want out of life?" The only times she is not happy, she says, are those times when she is sexually bored. Wyatt regards her with a respect bordering on awe. Unfortunately, Ms. Delany's bland screen presence doesn't match the flash of her verbal bravado. 
Freighted with all this sociological and psychological baggage, "Tombstone" is really two movies loosely sewn together. One is a conventional western in which Wyatt and his brothers Morgan (Bill Paxton) and Virgil (Sam Elliott) set out to save Tombstone from the clutches of an outlaw gang. The other is a self-consciously digressive meditation on the iconography of the Hollywood western. 
As in Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven," a film that clearly exerted a powerful influence on "Tombstone," the traditional archetypes triumph over modernist conventions. Efficiently directed, with a minimum of audience-teasing suspense, the shootout at the O.K. Corral has a crackling energy and believability. The scene, although short, is very intense and the film's high point. And the confrontations between Wyatt and his team and the forces of malevolent anarchy have a gut-twisting tension. 
Grafted onto this traditional framework, the film's meditative aspects are generally too self-conscious to fit comfortably. Especially when the movie tries to imagine a more enlightened role for women in the Old West, the screenplay begins to strain. 
"Tombstone" goes to great lengths to portray Doc as a prefigurement of a dissolute modern poet, a frontier-era Jim Morrison. In one scene, the character flourishes Latin phrases. In another, he bangs out part of a Chopin nocturne on an out-of-tune piano. Mr. Kilmer, who gave an uncanny impersonation of Morrison in "The Doors," can be terrific at this sort of thing. But in "Tombstone," a performance that aims to chew all the scenery in sight seems slightly mannered. 
Mr. Russell's clear, steady portrayal of Wyatt Earp gives the film a core of emotional integrity. While he doesn't project the mythic heroic stature of a Wayne or an Eastwood, he conveys the dignified rectitude of someone who has seen more than he wishes of the world's evil and still believes that civility can prevail over chaos. As he faces two moral crises -- one involving violence and the other love -- you can almost feel the wheels in his mind turning as he decides what to do. 
If Wyatt Earp's decision to meet violence with violence accords with classic Western tradition, his cautiously allowing himself to love Josephine, while still married, belongs to a different moral universe. It's a measure of Mr. Russell's thoughtful, understated performance that this decision carries real weight. 
"Tombstone" is, finally, a movie that wants to have it both ways. It wants to be at once traditional and morally ambiguous. The two visions don't quite harmonize. 
"Tombstone" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, violence and a fair amount of gore.

‽Grumpy Old Men‽,‽"Grumpy Old Men" is the kind of holiday movie a lot of people are searching for. It's cheerful, it's well under two hours and it doesn't concern any major social blights, unless you think Jack Lemmon tossing a dead fish into Walter Matthau's car is cause for alarm. 
Those rare qualities might make the film, which opens tomorrow, one of the season's more entertaining simply by default. What gives it a jolt in its own right is that Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau have only got wilier in the years since "The Odd Couple." They can do wonders even with this middling material about two neighbors in their late 60's, lifelong friends who express their affection by pretending to hate each other. 
The title may be generic and the setting an icy Minnesota town, but these grumps are positively related to Oscar and Felix. Mr. Matthau plays Max Goodman, the more slovenly of the two. A divorced former television repairman, Max seems to have an endless wardrobe of plaid hunting caps with earflaps. Mr. Lemmon plays John Gustafson, a widowed former history teacher who now spends a fair amount of time climbing out his second-story window and down a ladder to escape an I.R.S. investigator (Buck Henry). 
The supposed feud between the men has been going on for so long -- more than 50 years -- that only they can remember why it started. What's clear is that playing practical jokes and tolerating each other's presence has become their shared retirement hobby, along with fiercely competitive ice fishing. 
Just don't expect their bickering to be on the level of Neil Simon, and you won't be disappointed. The lines here include "Morning, moron," a greeting Mr. Lemmon conveys with acid conviction. Mr. Matthau drawls out "Eat my shorts" as if Max thinks he has invented a clever new insult. 
These men are not warmed-up caricatures of Felix and Oscar, but blood brothers who have got older without figuring out what to do with their empty retirements. One solution suddenly zooms into the neighborhood on a snowmobile. Ann-Margret plays Max and John's new neighbor, a middle-aged widow who gives them someone new to fight over. She is an artist and teacher transplanted from California, which gives her a mild, refreshing hint of spaciness. Max and John's cautious and rusty attempts at flirting and dating are funny without being condescending. 
Audiences have come to expect that every time Mr. Matthau raises an eyebrow it will be a perfect comic gesture, and his record is intact. But it is Mr. Lemmon who is especially engaging. After a string of high-pitched dramatic roles that seemed calculated to reach Oscar voters ("Glengarry Glen Ross" and "Short Cuts"), he is at ease and restrained here. He can pile up dramatic awards, but the light comic flair that shines through in "Some Like It Hot" and "Mr. Roberts" is still the best side of him. 
Donald Petrie, the director of "Mystic Pizza," shows the same sureness and affection for small-town life and characters here. Kevin Pollak as Max's son and Daryl Hannah as John's daughter both seem bemused by their parents and simply by being in this film. Ossie Davis has a small, crafty role as Max and John's friend. Only Burgess Meredith is forced into a foolish part as John's ninetysomething father, who smokes, drinks, fantasizes about women and calls his son a kid. He is a geezer, the sort of cliche that "Grumpy Old Men" otherwise avoids. 
Mr. Matthau and Mr. Lemmon may be familiar in these roles, but their characters are not really old or stale. And they're just grumpy enough. 
"Grumpy Old Men" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some strong language. Grumpy Old Men  Directed by Donald Petrie; written by Mark Steven Johnson; director of photography, John E. Jensen; edited by Bonnie Koehler; music by Alan Silvestri; production designer, David Chapman; produced by John Davis and Richard C. Berman; released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 105 minutes.

‽The Accompanist‽,‽Romane Bohringer is about to create a stir. This plain, baleful-looking young French actress will soon be seen in two very different films, including Cyril Collard's "Savage Nights," which was shown at this year's New Directors/New Films festival and is to begin its commercial run early next year. Her Cesar-winning performance in that film, as the wild, rebellious teen-age girlfriend of a man with AIDS, could not be less like her demure title role in "The Accompanist," the urbane new film by Claude Miller opening today at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas. 
Both performances reveal Miss Bohringer as a demanding, furiously intense screen presence, someone who can behave quite passively and still take up all the oxygen in a room. She has a raw, desperate quality that seems doubly startling against the sophisticated context of "The Accompanist," in which a veneer of elegance shields the principals from most forms of rude reality. 
Beginning late in 1942 in occupied France, "The Accompanist" devotes center stage to Irene Brice (Elena Safonova), a ravishing singer who is a great favorite with the Vichy set. But the glum, silent young woman by Irene's side commands a different kind of attention. Originally hired as a pianist for Irene's rehearsal sessions, Sophie Vasseur (Miss Bohringer) soon becomes a fixture in Irene's household. Cautious and watchful, well attuned to all the nuances of Irene's professional and romantic lives, Sophie glories in her employer's triumphs while wondering when her own moment in the spotlight will come. 
"The Accompanist," adapted by Mr. Miller and Luc Beraud from a novel by Nina Berberova, would be more like "All About Eve" if it were made with anything bolder than Mr. Miller's smoothly contemplative sensibility. As it is, Sophie's Eve Harrington thoughts remain unspoken, delivered to the audience in voice-over while Ms. Bohringer gazes dutifully at Ms. Safonova's lovely Irene. For all her silent frustration, Sophie cannot settle the question of just how actively she ought to assert herself. Her inaction can be seen in wider terms, given the wartime setting and France's larger paralysis during the German occupation. 
The third principal in "The Accompanist" is Charles Brice, Irene's husband, a businessman (played by Richard Bohringer, Romane's father). Rich and successful, determined to stay that way, the feisty Charles is sustained by Irene's glamorous career just as surely Sophie is. Charles is the film's most volatile character, the one who goes from idly dropping Marshal Petain's name to realizing it is time to pack the Vuitton luggage and personally carry it over the Pyrenees. 
Charles is also the story's main victim, being no match for either Sophie's silences or Irene's treacherous wiles. "Is being a woman so difficult?" he finally asks Sophie, who has become everybody's confidante.  "Yes, I think so," she answers, very much in earnest. Having studied Irene's travails and betrayals so intimately, Sophie knows whereof she speaks. 
Although Mr. Miller (whose earlier films include the 1981 "Garde a Vue") divides "The Accompanist" informally into three sections, one devoted to each of the main characters, it is Sophie who quietly burns a hole in the screen. Catapulted from the deprivation of wartime life to the sumptuousness of Irene's sheltered existence, Sophie quite literally swoons; soon afterward, her first experience of a grand late-night dinner with Irene's admirers makes her physically ill. The film is most striking in watching Ms. Bohringer subtly absorb the lessons of Irene's world and try, not always successfully, to make them her own. 
"The Accompanist" is fashionably open-ended in describing this process. Life is said to be passing Sophie by as the film begins, and it is still passing her by when the story is over. A contrived shipboard romance, as Sophie and the Brices flee to England, is never as affecting or credible as it's meant to be, but "The Accompanist" is not the sort of film that is watched for plot. Its chief pleasures are atmospheric, thanks to the keenly observed details of Irene's cosseted existence and the cascade of beautiful music that makes up the score. 
The soundtrack incorporates selections by Mozart, Strauss, Berlioz, Schumann and numerous others, making this one more recent French film (along with "Un Coeur en Hiver" and "Tous les Matins du Monde") in which music supplies an extra dimension of sensual delight. The audience will be as overwhelmed by Irene's recitals (with voice supplied by Laurence Monteyrol) as Sophie is herself, as the music combines with the imagery of this radiant, alluring singer draped in white satin and flanked by flowers. 
The film, which has its denouement in an English pub called the Angel, takes Sophie well beyond the surface of Irene's glamour. But the memory of Irene's music stays with her protegee long after the bloom is off the rose. It will stay with the audience, too. 
"The Accompanist" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes brief nudity and implicitly sexual situations.

‽
‽The Summer House‽,‽"The Summer House" might as well be called "The Jeanne Moreau Show." Like a television series tailored to the image of its star, this small-scale English movie presents the actress as a flamboyant, exotic and cynical woman with a rich sexual past. Her supposed function in the story is to save an unhappy young woman named Margaret from a disastrous marriage to her next-door neighbor, a 40-year-old twit who still lives with his mother. But her real purpose is to swoop through the film being Jeanne Moreau, in a performance that is over the top and tremendous fun to watch. She doesn't ever wink at the camera, but she and the audience know exactly what she is up to. 
Margaret (Lena Headey, who plays the rosy-cheeked housemaid in "The Remains of the Day") begins the film with an ominous dream about her recent trip to Egypt. The dream includes a young man and a bloody dagger, and hints at some disturbing reason why she has agreed to marry the dunderheaded neighbor, Syl (David Threlfall). 
Of course, the setting is 1959, when a girl wouldn't want to be "left on the shelf," as Margaret's drab mother, Monica, puts it. (Julie Walters is unrecognizably prim and gray as Monica.) But that is a trifling excuse here; the film is so contemporary in its freewheeling attitude toward sex and marriage that Monica's attitudes seem as frumpy as her clothes. 
Even Syl's widowed mother, played with incomparable wit by Joan Plowright, can see that Margaret loathes her fiance. And from the moment Monica's girlhood friend Lili (Ms. Moreau) arrives for the wedding, the question is how she will save Margaret from a fate worse than spinsterhood. 
The answer is not hard to guess. The issue is a delaying tactic that allows Lili to possess the screen. She is half-Egyptian and half-English, with bright orange-red hair. She trails multicolored scarves and is loaded down with enormous Egyptian rings and necklaces. She delivers her droll lines with a world-weary wisdom that has been nearly patented by Ms. Moreau. "I wonder if he wears lace panties," Lili casually wonders about Syl while she and Margaret walk to the butcher's. "Egyptian men don't as a rule, but the English are a breed apart." 
Joan Plowright is one of the few actresses confident and smart enough to realize that the only way to steal a scene from Jeanne Moreau is to claim the opposite camp. Looking totally unglamorous and underplaying in the extreme, she is every bit her co-star's match. 
When Ms. Plowright first appears as Mrs. Monro she is sitting in bed wearing a white nightcap, resembling Little Red Riding Hood's granny. Eventually she and Lili develop a friendship, and in one scene they go to a pub where they become falling-down drunk and honest. It has been easy for Mrs. Monro to forgive Lili for a long-ago affair with her husband; as she admits, she is quite a bit happier as a widow. "I look forward to it," Lili says, efficiently dismissing her artist-husband (John Wood). 
Mrs. Monro also has the perfect response to her friend's portentous remarks. "Oh, Lili, that makes no sense," she says, "but I believe you." 
The director, Waris Hussein, was wise to let these two actresses run away with the movie. The screenplay is at times too whimsical and at times too slight. When Lili pulls off her ultimate trick, in the garden house of the title, it hints at a darkness in her character that has been suggested but not developed. And it was hardly necessary to make all the men unfaithful idiots. 
But it would be too bad if this charming film were lost among the season's big commercial movies. Acting together in top form, Ms. Moreau and Ms. Plowright are something to see. The Summer House Directed by Waris Hussein; written by Martin Sherman, based on the novel "The Clothes in the Wardrobe," by Alice Thomas Ellis; director of photography, Rex Maidment; edited by Ken Pearce; music by Stanley Myers; production designer, Stuart Walker; produced by Norma Heyman; released by the Samuel Goldwyn Company.

‽Wrestling Ernest Hemingway‽,‽"Wrestling Ernest Hemingway" begins with the camera looking down at Richard Harris, as a man in his 70's, naked on the floor doing push-ups. This is not the most flattering angle from which the actor has ever been shot, which is very much the point. The film, which follows the growing friendship of two aging men who have nothing in common but loneliness, means to do something radical, at least by Hollywood standards: it tells the demographically unpopular tale of old people. 
But the self-conscious bravado of the opening scene also suggests the film's overwhelming weakness. Instead of simply assuming that the old have interesting lives, the film never stops congratulating itself for being daring enough to focus on them. It shows the terrible strain of trying too hard. 
The story belongs to Mr. Harris, as Frank, once a daring sea captain and now a loud, hard-drinking retiree who has been divorced four times. He has lived so wildly that he actually wrestled Hemingway in Puerto Rico in 1938, or so he claims. He flirts with Piper Laurie, as a proud and proper woman he meets at the movies. He argues with Shirley MacLaine, as the weary owner of the rundown apartment house to which he has just moved. 
Mr. Harris's over-the-top performance suits his character, whose Hemingway story suggests the escapist myths by which he has lived. The character is helped by the film's exact use of detail. Frank takes a bottle and a Hemingway book to the park. He wears bright orange shorts, is grizzled and unshaven. It is not upsetting to see Mr. Harris looking old here, but it is extremely disconcerting to realize how much he has come to resemble George Carlin. 
Robert Duvall plays Walter, a fussy Cuban bachelor and one-time barber who also lives in the fictional Florida town of Sweetwater. The cautious Walter goes to the same restaurant every day and always gets two bacon sandwiches (one for breakfast, one to keep for lunch), mainly so he can continue a sweet friendship with a young waitress (Sandra Bullock, from "Demolition Man"). Mr. Duvall's restraint suits his character as well, but he is saddled with a Cuban accent that calls attention to the film's many contrivances. Here are two intelligent but distant performances, which make it impossible to forget that we are watching Richard Harris and Robert Duvall acting old. 
The three actresses are appealing, but their roles are understandably tiny. This is a story about male bonding, geriatric style. When Frank forces his friendship on Walter, the pattern is instantly predictable: Walter's resistance, the inevitable closeness, the explosive argument in the street. Frank and Walter are like "The Odd Couple" without the jokes. 
But the film, which opens today at the First and 62d Cinemas, also offers scenes that are generous and genuine. Among this season's many overlong movies, this is the one, running 2 hours and 3 minutes, that would have benefitted most from losing a half-hour. There is a finer movie hidden inside the scenery chewing and predictability. 
Among the most eloquent touches is the wordless image of Walter, viewed from outside his apartment window, dressed in a suit and tie and dancing quite debonairly by himself, an imaginary woman in his arms. 
And an episode between Mr. Harris and Ms. MacLaine is exceptionally poignant. Frank drunkenly goes to his landlady's apartment late at night. He desperately wants to sleep with her; she is guarded and self-protective, but may be as lonely as he is. It is heartbreaking to hear Frank admit, "I can't do this anymore." He is talking not only about this physical moment, but also about his desperately isolated life. 
The director, Randa Haines, is best known for her feature films "Children of a Lesser God" and "The Doctor." But her strongest work was the tough, made-for-television movie about incest, "Something About Amelia." As in her other features, "Wrestling Ernest" too often gives in to an easy, sentimental impulse, creating the kind of scene in which Frank and Walter urinate in the ocean while fireworks explode in the background. Mr. Macho Hemingway would have felt right at home using the ocean as a toilet, but what would he have made of those fancy fireworks? 
"Wrestling Ernest Hemingway" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes strong language and a glimpse of nudity.

‽The Pelican Brief‽,‽MILLIONS of people have already seen "The Pelican Brief," though it is only now opening at neighborhood theaters. That's because John Grisham's novel is written as instant movie material. It has a big secret; it has a big explosion; it has a conspiracy plot that leads all the way to the top. It has a heroine who sounds exactly like Julia Roberts, if Julia Roberts were going to law school. Mr. Grisham has even incorporated lots of New Orleans and Washington scenery, thus giving his intrigue plot some extra tourist appeal. 
Mr. Grisham, a fixture at the top of the best-seller list and the most cinematic popular author this side of Michael Crichton, habitually writes half-books. The opening setups are what sell his stories, even if they disintegrate into empty skullduggery and endings that are conspicuously weak. It helps that his prose is crisp and streamlined enough to persuade the reader that something substantial is afoot, even when there are strong indications to the contrary. At best, a Grisham book offers a veneer of seriousness and a strong jolt of clever escapism. Food for thought it's not. 
As written and directed by Alan J. Pakula with all the glossy professionalism he can muster, the film version of "The Pelican Brief" has much the same tenor. It is, in fact, the closest thing to an exact transcription of Mr. Grisham's novel as might have been imagined, to the point where the author's devoted readers will experience strong deja vu. 
The story, neatly compressed, unfolds in dependable and photogenic ways. And it is coaxed along by Mr. Pakula's considerable skills as a brisk, methodical film maker. It could be shorter, and it could be more imaginative. (Sydney Pollack's superior Grisham adaptation, "The Firm," really did breathe life into the author's paper-thin characters.) But as a fast-moving, good-looking visual replica of an intrigue potboiler, it also could have been a lot worse. 
"The Pelican Brief" is best watched as a celebration of liquid brown eyes and serious star quality, thanks to the casting of Ms. Roberts and Denzel Washington in its leading roles. Neither of these first-rate actors is shown to great dramatic advantage, but they both do a lot to make the movie shine. 
Ms. Roberts is cast as Darby Shaw, a brilliant law student who becomes the Nancy Drew of the 90's. And Mr. Washington plays Gray Grantham, the brilliant black newspaper reporter who was white in Mr. Grisham's novel. Mr. Grisham didn't actually write an ending, but he did close his book with a clinch and a promise of romance between Darby and Gray. The film, which thrives on the comfortable chemistry between its two stars, isn't quite gutsy or colorblind enough to do the same. 
The premise, in short: two Supreme Court Justices are assassinated, and a feisty Tulane University Law School student wants to know why. Encouraged by her professor, Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepard, who is also her lover), Darby does some research. Amazingly, she digs up something very, very pertinent to the assassinations, and she nicknames her written report the Pelican Brief. Callahan casually turns this brief over to an F.B.I. friend (John Heard), to whom he boasts about Darby. "Here, take a look at it," Callahan says. "You'd get a kick out of how her mind works." 
Kick, eh? Callahan soon receives a kick of his own, and then Darby is off and running. Viewers and/or readers are asked to believe that this lone, gorgeous law student has stumbled onto the power to bring down people in high places, and that skilled assassins are stalking her every move. To the rescue: Gray Grantham, journalist, whom Darby first gets in touch with by telephone, calling herself Alice. Gray scribbles on his notepad while they talk. "Name not Alice?" Gray writes. Gray is supposed to be a star reporter. 
As the film piles on shovelfuls of further exposition, Mr. Washington and Ms. Roberts are left to look terrific and recite perfunctory lines. She (for instance): "How can you be so sure?" Or he (authoritatively): "Darby, if this thing reaches as deep and goes as high as we think it does, these men will do anything not to be exposed." It's a shame that Ms. Roberts is relegated to looking worried most of the time, but even in a by-the-numbers role she manages to glow. During a hiatus from screen acting, she has spent time becoming even more drop-dead beautiful and a shade more self-possessed. 
Also seen to good advantage in Mr. Pakula's cleverly cast film are Tony Goldwyn as the nice young man who effectively runs the country, and Robert Culp as the President who very clearly doesn't. Mr. Culp, seen avidly training his dog in the Oval Office, gives the film one of its rare flashes of wit. The supporting cast also includes William Atherton as the instantly fishy director of the C.I.A., and John Lithgow as the blustery, suspender-wearing newspaper editor who refers to the author of the Pelican Brief as "Bird Girl." 
As photographed by Stephen Goldblatt, "The Pelican Brief" looks picturesque whether it is dawdling in New Orleans's French Quarter or at Mount Vernon. Mr. Pakula's screenplay does a heroic job of cramming in information and keeping the characters in motion. But it never answers the story's most nagging question: Why don't the assassins simply ambush Darby on a shopping trip? She goes into hiding with only the dress she is wearing, then manages a number of nice costume changes throughout the rest of the film.  "The Pelican Brief" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, most of it discreetly staged. The Pelican Brief  Directed by Alan J. Pakula; written by Mr. Pakula, based on the novel by John Grisham; director of photography, Stephen Goldblatt; edited by Tom Rolf and Trudy Ship; music by James Horner; production designer, Philip Rosenberg; produced by Mr. Pakula and Pieter Jan Brugge; released by Warner Brothers.

‽
‽Beethoven's 2nd‽,‽Anyone making a dog movie could do much worse than to borrow the plot of "101 Dalmatians." "Beethoven's 2d" may be the sequel to last year's hit about a lovable, sloppy St. Bernard adopted by a suburban family, but it is also a lively and sweetly told story of puppy-napping. 
Now a beloved member of the Newton family, Beethoven sows a few wild oats with another St. Bernard named Missy. She's the one with the pink bow between her ears. Missy is also a pawn in an ugly divorce. The wife, Regina, takes her away from her kindly owner, and threatens to hold her until she gets money. And when she discovers the four puppies born to Missy and Beethoven, she threatens to take them as well. Fortunately, the younger Newton children, 13-year-old Ted and 9-year-old Emily, escape with the pups and hide them in the basement. They remember how long it took their father, Charles Grodin, to learn to love Beethoven in the original movie. 
The comic villains are never much of a threat to Beethoven's family. With her swooping eyebrows, Regina (Debi Mazar) is a fair match for Cruella De Vil. She does everything short of threaten to turn the puppies into a coat. "Drown 'em," she whines. Her partner, Floyd (Chris Penn), a man too stupid to eat with his mouth shut. 
As in the first "Beethoven," Mr. Grodin holds the film together. He is the most soothing and protective dad since Pongo, the original Dalmatian. He is one of the few comic actors who can hold his own with a dog, without mugging it up, and is especially game when he and Beethoven are entered in a burger-eating contest. 
"Beethoven's 2d" will be irresistible to children, but it doesn't have the crossover appeal that allowed the original to be entertaining for adults as well. And it has three long musical montages that may drag for everybody. In two of them, James Ingram and Dolly Parton sing "The Day I Fall in Love." At least it's not called "The Love Theme From Beethoven," though Beethoven and Missy do look soulfully into each other's eyes. 
The relative tameness of "Bethoven's 2d" may come from the change in directors. The original was directed by Ivan Reitman, of "Ghostbusters," "Twins" and "Dave" fame. The sequel is directed by Rod Daniel, who directed the James Belushi flop "K-9." But he does have a way with dogs. He makes the Beethoven family seem adorable, even to those of us capable of imagining a St. Bernard coat. 
"Beethoven's 2d" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some drunken teen-agers, who learn that drinking doesn't pay. Beethoven's 2d  Directed by Rod Daniel; written by Len Blum; director of photography, Bill Butler; edited by Sheldon Kahn and William D. Gordean; music by Randy Edelman; production designer, Lawrence Miller; produced by Michael C. Gross and Joe Medjuck; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 87 minutes. This film is rated PG.

‽Wayne's World 2‽,‽Time has caught up with Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey), even if it hasn't actually made them any smarter. In "Wayne's World 2," they begin to feel a strange aging sensation, "like I'm in a John Hughes rite du passage movie," as Wayne grandly describes it. Spurred on by this, Wayne begins searching for the meaning of his life. He finds it through the help of Jim Morrison, who appears to him in a dream. According to the film, Jim Morrison spends his time with Sammy Davis Jr. when he isn't busy giving Wayne advice. 
"Wayne's World 2," a very good-humored sequel for anyone in tune with its subject, sends Wayne and Garth back through the mists of rock-and-roll history at Morrison's suggestion. He has advised them to stage Waynestock, a retro-style outdoor rock concert. This is terribly confusing for Garth, who always thought the peace sign and the Mercedes-Benz logo were identical. Even more bewilderingly, Wayne and Garth stumble across ancient rock artifacts as they try to plan the show. Showing a worn old "Frampton Comes Alive" LP to his girlfriend, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), Wayne explains: "If you lived in the suburbs, you were issued it. It came in the mail with samples of Tide." 
Studying a Gerry and the Pacemakers record, Wayne muses: "You know, I bet those guys actually have pacemakers by now." The audience that finds this funny will also know why Wayne and Garth make their road crew practice straightening out a toppled microphone while being pelted by a tennis-ball-serving machine. This is a perfect way of simulating the refined atmosphere to which Waynestock aspires. 
It should be noted that neither this film nor the original "Wayne's World" aims much higher than that, and that both have been carefully calibrated as home video-style comedies. It barely matters whether the gags here have any bearing on each other, as long as they fly by quickly; these films' disjointed, grab-bag humor works best at its most absurd. So a ridiculous martial arts interlude between Wayne and Cassandra's father (James Hong) becomes droll because its audio is dubbed into English, and because the same loud noises that indicate mighty blows also accompany a phone call. A brief sequence bringing the story to London is funny because Wayne and Garth make it clear Paramount wouldn't pay to send them there. 
"Wayne's World 2," which also includes a few movie parodies of uneven cleverness, spends a lot of time winking at its audience in similar ways. Calling attention to its own artifice whenever possible, the film finds its craftiest silliness in Wayne and Garth themselves. Mr. Myers, and particularly the sly Mr. Carvey, still breathe life into these lovable burnouts, who manage to be innocents abroad even in the privacy of their own homes. This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film's gags. But the formula isn't tired yet. 
Particularly entertaining this time is Ralph Brown as a venerable English roadie who delivers several shades of "Spinal Tap"; sorting the M &amp; M's by color was once an important part of his job, and he never tires of telling the same name-dropping stories to unsuspecting listeners. Also on hand is Aerosmith, the Dorian Gray of rock bands, to serve the same purpose Alice Cooper did in the first film. If you were Wayne or Garth, you could spend time wondering what Aerosmith's importance here has to do with "Dazed and Confused," in which Aerosmith is also conspicuously mentioned. 
Also appearing, in brief cameos, are Charlton Heston, Drew Barrymore and Rip Taylor, who delivers the definitive assessment of Jim Morrison's vocal style. ("He's a god in my country," the Hong Kong-born Cassandra says breathlessly of Mr. Taylor.) Kim Basinger is a lot foxier than funny as the woman who does her utmost to seduce Garth. ("Can I have some cocoa later?" he wants to know.) Christopher Walken, sleek and sinister as ever, has the role of the record producer who promises to further Cassandra's tiresome career.  It comes as a relief that Cassandra, an aspiring rock vocalist and successful trash-flash fashion plate, does not have a chance to sing this time. 
As directed by Stephen Surjik and written by Mr. Myers with Bonnie Turner and Terry Turner, "Wayne's World 2" keeps the franchise alive in ways that may eventually prove quite scary. After all, as the mixed-up English roadie points out, it's not as if the Grateful Dead were still together any more, is it? Wayne and Garth just might outlast them all. 
"Wayne's World 2" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and sexual situations.

‽Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit‽,‽Whoopi Goldberg must have an evil twin. The bad twin is the one who can't stay out of the tabloids, one day being happily roasted with racial jokes at the Friars Club and the next offering a cookbook recipe for "Jewish American Princess Fried Chicken." She may be tasteless but at least she's interesting. It's the good twin who surfaces in "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit," and she's pretty much a snooze. 
Ms. Goldberg's brash persona brought a whiff of mischief to the original "Sister Act," in which she played a mediocre lounge singer, Deloris Van Cartier, forced to masquerade as Sister Mary Clarence. There was plenty of sentimental uplift at the end, but throughout Ms. Goldberg made it clear that a convent was the last place Deloris's married, mobster boyfriend would find her. 
The sequel suffers from a lame, saccharine premise and a fatally earnest manner. This time, Deloris is called back by her old convent cohorts when they can't get through to their streetwise high-school students. "Help us by becoming a teacher," implores Maggie Smith as Mother Superior. Before long Mary Clarence is entering her music class in a statewide choral competition and along the way saving the troubled school from becoming a parking lot. 
Now Ms. Goldberg looks comfortable wearing a habit; no more penguin jokes for her. There is no irreverence here, and no sense of what street kids are like. Sister Mary Clarence's supposedly belligerent students act out by putting glue on her chair. (In real life wouldn't they just pull their guns on her?) 
And if the movie seems muddled about high school, it is hopeless about music. The original "Sister Act" counted on hokey but catchy adaptations of girl-group songs. The sequel whizzes through a bit of everything from gospel to Motown to the tamest versions of rap ever recorded (they're like rap lite). The movie may not intend to be creaky and condescending, but it flirts with the idea that rap is the devil's music. 
Bill Duke, who has directed much smarter films ("A Rage in Harlem") as well as the syrupy Disney movie "The Cemetery Club," is less at fault than the Up With People script. The returning nuns have little to do except walk through smaller versions of their old roles: Kathy Najimy is still the bubbly Sister Mary Patrick, Mary Wickes the tough Sister Mary Lazarus, and Wendy Makenna the meek Sister Mary Robert. Three fine character actors -- Barnard Hughes, Michael Jeter and Brad Sullivan -- are wasted as priests. And though Ms. Goldberg was reportedly paid $7 million to make this movie, she seems curiously low on energy, even when doing a James Brown impression. 
The best part of "Sister Act 2" is the closing credits. The nuns bop around singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" and the priests are photographed from above while they lie on the floor doing a Busby Berkeley dance routine. Only then does this sequel hint at the gentle, entertaining satire of the original. 
There is one conspicuous missed opportunity. Early on, the school's misinformed headmaster tells Sister Mary Clarence what he has heard: "Your last posting was at a women's prison in the Louisiana bayou." Now that is a premise with possibilities. 
"Sister Act 2" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes a mild expletive.

‽The Hawk‽,‽"The Hawk" is a small, efficient English thriller that plays off the question: How well do you know the people closest to you? Helen Mirren plays a suburban housewife named Annie, who begins to suspect that her husband, Stephen, is a serial killer called the Hawk. Stephen always happens to be traveling on business when the Hawk strikes; the murder weapon is a hammer, possibly like the one Annie can't find around the house; worst of all, the Hawk preys on women with two children, just like Annie. 
Ms. Mirren is the centerpiece of the film, in a role that might be the reverse image of her best-known part, Inspector Jane Tennison on the television series "Prime Suspect." Instead of playing a fiercely confident detective, here she is a befuddled woman trying to be strong: tortured by doubts, short on self-esteem, stuck in a bad marriage. In one smartly detailed and affecting scene, when Annie goes out to dinner she dresses garishly wrong and is humiliated by her drunken husband. 
"The Hawk," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is best when it stays close to Annie's self-doubts and growing fears. Ms. Mirren creates a character so sympathetic that her worst nightmares seem plausible. She keeps the audience weighing evidence and wondering along with her: Is Stephen a killer or just a louse? And why does his brother give everyone the creeps? 
The film turns weaker and too tricked up when it drags in Annie's history of depression, which allows Stephen (George Costigan) and his interfering mother (Rosemary Leach) to discredit her suspicions. By then the audience knows that while Annie might be wrong, she's not stupid or delusional. 
Though the film redeems itself with a couple of surprise twists, it is not as taut or inventive as it needs to be. The director, David Hayman, has a penchant for ominous music, but he creates a clear, steady vision that reflects his level-headed heroine. "The Hawk" is not as gripping as "Prime Suspect," but it passes easily as a weaker cousin. 
"The Hawk" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence and some graphic views of corpses. The Hawk  Directed by David Hayman; written by Peter Ransley, based on his novel; director of photography, Andrew Dunn; edited by Justin Krish; music by Nick Bicat; production designer, David Myerscough-Jones; produced by Ann Wingate and Eileen Quinn; released by Castle Hill.

‽Geronimo: An American Legend‽,‽"A powerful stocky warrior with a perpetual scowl on his face, Geronimo personified all that was savage and cruel in the Apache," states Robert M. Utley's introduction to a recent edition of "The Truth About Geronimo," written by Britton Davis in 1929. "Few whites who knew him had much praise for him, and most of his own people feared and disliked him. Davis characterized him as 'a thoroughly vicious, intractable and treacherous man. His only redeeming traits were courage and determination. His word, no matter how earnestly pledged, was worthless.' History has supported this judgment." 
Obviously, times have changed. The revisionist view of Geronimo is apparent in "Geronimo: An American Legend," an earnest, leaden epic directed by Walter Hill from a reverential screenplay by John Milius and Larry Gross. No matter that this film's narrator is actually Britton Davis, played as a bland young West Point graduate by Matt Damon and urging the story forward with colorless observations. The real flavor of Davis's account, and of the ferocity that earned Geronimo his place in history, is nowhere evident on screen. 
If the baby, so to speak, is Geronimo's dauntless fighting spirit, it has been thrown out with the bath water of outmoded film stereotypes regarding American Indians. Shooting evocatively amid Utah landscapes that summon John Ford's westerns, Mr. Hill finds ample opportunities to settle old scores. The contempt and condescension with which Indian warriors were so often treated has given way to a warm bath of noble sentiments, none of which advances this film's dramatic purposes at all. "With all this land, why is there no room for the Apache?" asks Geronimo, on one of the many occasions when the film's characters seem to speak their lines in capital letters. "Why does the White-Eye want all land?" 
As played by Wes Studi, who was so formidable and effective as Magua in "The Last of the Mohicans," Geronimo is more often made to seem gently perplexed than fierce. This is more a dramatic problem than a political one, since all the film's actors share a placid, reasonable demeanor that becomes unexpectedly dull. As the film recounts the last battles, in the 1880's, between the Chiricahua Apache and the American and Mexican soldiers who overwhelmingly outnumbered them, it adopts an attitude of undifferentiated regret. Almost no one dares play the villain in the fight that destroyed the Indians' independence and altered their destiny. 
The film views the events it depicts as part of a colossal misunderstanding, rarely doing justice to the Apaches' anger or going so far as to assign blame. The story's American soldiers are an unusually open-minded group, led at first by Brig. Gen. George Crook (Gene Hackman). General Crook, such an easygoing officer that he at one point invites Geronimo in for coffee, offers Mr. Hackman a role not even he can breathe much life into. Potentially more interesting is another nice-guy officer, Lieut. Charles Gatewood, played by Jason Patric with a soft, purring drawl and a pensive manner. The formidable Mr. Hill ("The Warriors," "The Long Riders") has more often presented tough, vinegary characters who don't waste time questioning their sense of purpose. This subject brings out his kinder, gentler side, which effectively reins him in. 
Also in the film, and showing some of its few signs of life, is Robert Duvall as one of the story's maverick characters, a veteran Indian scout named Al Sieber. Sieber sometimes voices a healthy skepticism that would have been welcome elsewhere in the story. 
The dialogue ("It is good to see the great warrior") does not seem any weightier by virtue of its having been translated into the Apache language in some places. The scenery is automatically vivid, especially when it takes advantage of the landscape's stark contrasts, but Lloyd Ahern's cinematography is sometimes suffused with dusty reddish tones. Even the musical score by the resourceful Ry Cooder has a droning, authentic quality, suggesting that earnestness has taken precedence over energy. It has, every time. 
"Geronimo: An American Legend" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence.

‽Bank Robber‽,‽The title character of Nick Mead's terminally whimsical satire, "Bank Robber," is a handsome thief named Billy (Patrick Dempsey), who, whenever he needs money, simply dresses up in a fancy business suit and holds up a bank. As the movie begins, Billy has decided that it's time to retire. All he needs is enough money to buy the sloop of his dreams and sail off into a tropical sunset with his girlfriend, Selina (Olivia D'Abo). 
Billy pulls off his final heist but makes one fatal mistake. He fails to destroy a surveillance camera. No sooner has he hid out in the Heartbreak Hotel than he finds his own image flashed on the television news. 
"Bank Robber," which was filmed in Los Angeles, wants to evoke a similar mixture of urban nightmare and surreal zaniness as Martin Scorsese's New York fantasy "After Hours," but it lacks the focus of Mr. Scorsese's comedy. Most of the movie, which is the directorial debut of Mr. Mead, an English film maker, is set in Billy's hotel hideaway where he discovers that he is anything but anonymous. A greedy desk clerk, who recognizes his picture, extorts hundreds of dollars for changing a light bulb. A pizza delivery man, a drug dealer and a messenger from a home shopping program hold him up for more cash. A television news crew, informed of his whereabouts, also arrives to interview him. 
In between visitors, he drifts off into surreal reveries about his true love, who is actually sleeping with his best friend, Chris (James Garde). The only warm encounter Billy enjoys is with Priscilla (Lisa Bonet), a call girl he summons and who promptly falls in love with him. 
Billy is also the object of an extremely lackadaisical manhunt led by two pot-smoking policemen (Judge Reinhold and Forest Whitaker). The scenes in which they exchange absurd 1940's-style cliches about how Billy grew up in a bad neighborhood are the movie's lamest. 
Among the topics spoofed by the movie, which opens today at the Village East, are Billy the Kid, outlaw celebrity and the "Lethal Weapon" series. But the humor is both too oblique and too mild-mannered for the movie to cohere as a modern comic fable. It amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected tangents that come to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. 
For all its flightiness, "Bank Robber" is not without charm. Mr. Dempsey's Billy is an endearing, romantic jerk who hardly has a mean bone in his body. The film also has some of the juicier sex scenes to be found in a recent movie. The chemistry between Mr. Dempsey and Ms. Bonet, who both exude a carefree animal magnetism, gives "Bank Robber" a heady erotic glow. 
"Bank Robber" has been rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It includes explicit sex scenes that stop short of pornography.

‽Six Degrees of Separation‽,‽The Fifth Avenue apartment where much of "Six Degrees of Separation" unfolds is filled with expensive artifacts, most notably Flan and Ouisa Kittredge themselves. Flan (Donald Sutherland) and Ouisa (Stockard Channing), a self-important art dealer and the wife he describes as "a Dada manifesto," live all too comfortably within this sanctuary. The Kittredges are serenely unaware that their lives can be rearranged by a single uninvited guest, one who manages to tap into their fears, desires and hilariously fatuous daydreams. Neither Flan nor Ouisa might have suspected, before this story begins, that they could yearn so desperately for the respect of their own children, or hope to be extras in a movie version of "Cats." 
The visitor is Paul (Will Smith), the cunning, too-good-to-be-true impostor whose exploits are derived from a real news story. Paul has done enough homework to know how perfectly a fake connection to Sidney Poitier will sway uneasy white socialites, people who may be self-styled liberals but can still address a friend as "You darling old poop." 
It is Paul's visit that prompts Ouisa to muse about the title phrase, which in John Guare's play (and now his screenplay) presents destiny as a kind of mathematical puzzle. Chance meetings with exactly the right people can permanently alter unexamined lives. 
A seventh degree of separation, and the one that matters most here, is the gap between stage and screen. It has been bridged very aggressively by the director Fred Schepisi, whose frenetic and literal-minded approach to this material takes getting used to. Onstage, directed by Jerry Zaks with a backdrop of only two sofas and a fake Kandinsky, "Six Degrees of Separation" had a quick, precise comic style that left a great deal to the imagination. Much of the play's hilarity came from its lightning-fast juxtapositions, and the dizzying ways in which they allowed the story to escalate. The film moves just as speedily, but it's much more cluttered. In the presence of so much extra baggage, the screwball timing takes on a frantic edge. 
However, Mr. Schepisi's directorial vigor wins out over his film's skittishness. This version may horrify purists, but it winds up working entertainingly on its own broader, flashier terms. Seldom has a play been opened up this spiritedly, with a crowd of onlookers to hear Flan and Ouisa's titillating story (a role once played by the theater audience), a number of well-chosen New York locations and an array of people and paintings to flesh out Mr. Guare's social satire. The film uses its extras as skillfully as it uses a mock Kandinsky, which is prominently featured. It seems appropriate that the film's real and phony artworks are casually intermingled. 
Despite its busier style, the film is very faithful to Mr. Guare's story, with Stockard Channing in a reprise of her fine performance as its hilariously brittle heroine. Equally deft is Donald Sutherland, who turns Flan's fatuousness into a great comic asset. (When Paul delivers a speech that he claims is part of a thesis that has been stolen from him, Flan says solemnly, "I hope your muggers read every word!") Also amusing are Mary Beth Hurt and Bruce Davison as two more Upper East Side types who have been seduced by Paul and bitten by the "Cats" bug. "My son has no involvement with any black frauds!" Ms. Hurt declares indignantly, upon learning that Paul's trickery also involves her child. 
The story's college-age characters are also funny, especially Jeffrey Abrams (the screenwriter of "Regarding Henry") as the wildly outraged son of a divorced doctor (Richard Masur). And there is an amusingly sardonic turn by Ian McKellen as a visiting South African who happens to witness Paul's night at the Kittredges'. ("Your father means a great deal in South Africa," he informs Paul.) The film's only casting misstep comes with Mr. Smith, who plays Paul as a smooth, pleasant interloper without the hints of mockery or desperation that should accompany his deception. Mr. Smith recites his lines plausibly without bringing great passion to the role. 
As "Six Degrees of Separation" ricochets about town (and to Cambridge, Mass., where these mink-draped matrons travel indignantly to question their surly children), it has great fun defining the habitat of its privileged characters. "Are these all rich people?" Paul asks Trent (Anthony Michael Hall), the gay man who helps to coach him about the Kittredges and their circle. "No," Trent answers definitively. "Hand to mouth on a higher plateau." 
Patrizia von Brandenstein's production design is witty and ambitious in establishing the proper ambiance. And Ian Baker's cinematography gives the film a mischievously sophisticated look. Also helpful are the authentic extras who fill out the party scenes (Kitty Carlisle Hart plays one hostess) and look properly aghast over the Kittredges' ordeal. Less imaginative are the side trips to every minor setting (the Strand Bookstore, the Rainbow Room, a skating rink) that figures even faintly in this story.

‽A Dangerous Woman‽,‽In "A Dangerous Woman," Debra Winger sinks deeply into the drab role of Martha Horgan, a sheltered innocent living in a small California town. Characters like Martha have a way of attracting the storyteller's interest at a very precise point in their lives. It is the moment just before the character's peaceful existence is ruptured by some seismic force, a force like sex or death or a symbolic coming of age. "A Dangerous Woman" is soap opera enough to churn up all three. 
With Ms. Winger's eerily convincing performance as its centerpiece, the film creates a world of sexual chicanery that would do any television series proud. Martha is taken care of by her Aunt Frances (Barbara Hershey), a rich, beautiful widow involved in an extramarital affair with a state assemblyman (John Terry). That liaison starts off the film with a suitable bang, as the assemblyman's wife (Laurie Metcalf) drunkenly drives her car into the widow's front porch as a means of registering her irritation. 
Martha, a fragile creature in a girlish nightgown and thick glasses, watches this outburst in bewildered horror. But the film intends it as a harbinger of Martha's own act of violence, which is already in the works and will serve as the story's dramatic climax. "A Dangerous Woman" builds, vividly if not entirely believably, to an enduringly strange crime that almost resembles an act of tenderness, and to a crazy coda that reaches the last word in dysfunctional family life. 
Martha is kept occupied by a menial job at the local dry cleaner's, where some additional hanky-panky is under way. A co-worker there is Birdy (Chloe Webb), a kind soul who tolerates Martha's notion that the two women are best friends. Birdy has a no-good boyfriend named Getso (David Strathairn), who steals from the till and romances other women behind Birdy's back. Martha, who has a kind of moral clairvoyance, sees and abhors Getso's dishonesty when no one else can. 
Also on hand, in the story's sudsiest role, is Gabriel Byrne as Mackey, the handsome, hard-drinking carpenter who shows up to fix Frances's porch and manages to romance Martha along the way. Although played with a robust physicality by Mr. Byrne, Mackey is also the most literary conceit in this story, which has been adapted by Naomi Foner from the novel by Mary McGarry Morris. The scene that has him making a simulated confession, with Martha enlisted to play priest, makes it clear that "A Dangerous Woman" has its origins on the page rather than on screen. 
The film has been given an appealingly languid and intimate mood by the director, Stephen Gyllenhaal ("Waterland"). And its cast is attractive, holding the interest even when the story's contrivances are left needlessly exposed. (Martha's purchase of Tupperware is allowed to take on symbolic meaning.) Among the more entertaining small performances is Jan Hooks's brief turn as a cosmetics saleswoman trying awfully hard to adapt her sales pitch to a customer as challenging as Martha. 
But the only real focus of "A Dangerous Woman" is Ms. Winger's furiously self-effacing performance. She stares out perplexedly from behind Martha's glasses and tries to make the audience understand what Martha sees. Affecting a quizzical, birdlike posture (and a look so dowdy she resembles Gilda Radner in her satirical nerd role on "Saturday Night Live"), Ms. Winger breathes life into Martha's thwarted gentleness even when the film leaves her at a disadvantage. "A Dangerous Woman" never quite explains Martha's past, or the forces that shaped her. It only catches her at a fateful moment, when the makings of a small-town melodrama are already in place. 
"A Dangerous Woman" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, nudity and sexual situations.

‽Traps‽,‽Movies like "Traps" that glibly equate kinky sexual behavior with political and moral decay are at best naive, at worst ludicrous. This solemnly overheated  drama, which opens today at Cinema Village, is set in French Indochina in 1950.  Whenever it wants to put Daniel (Sami Frey), the ruthless French owner of a Southeast Asian rubber plantation, in a sinister light, it shows him making creepy passes at his nervous house guests. 
Those guests, Louise and Michael Duffield (Saskia Reeves and Robert Reynolds), are an English writer and photographer who have been engaged to concoct a photojournalistic essay for the rubber company's corporate publication. Although their assignment is to show Asian workers submitting happily to French domination, the world the couple stumbles into is far from serene. Communist insurgents are methodically taking over the country's rural areas, and even Daniel's trusted Asian servant, Tuan (Kiet Lam), has joined the  Vietminh. 
The Duffields watch aghast as their host acquiesces to the police torture of suspected terrorists. In the most suspenseful scene, Daniel's emotionally unstable daughter, Viola (Jacqueline McKenzie), and Louise are captured by the Communists and threatened with execution. 
The film's cut-and-dried morality is glaringly reflected in Louise and Michael's marital strife. While Michael is content to grind out the required corporate propaganda, Louise's eyes are opened to the injustices of French colonialism. In the most preposterous of several sex scenes, Michael gratuitously rapes his wife while Viola listens attentively through the wall. Later in the film, Michael wakes up in the morning beside Daniel, who apparently molested him after he passed out drunk. Michael immediately goes ballistic, and the melodramatic aftermath would probably have made Hemingway blush. 
"Traps" is the first feature directed by Pauline Chan, an Australian film maker who was born in Vietnam, where portions of the movie were shot. Adapted by Miss Chan and Robert Carter from "Dreamhouse," a novel by Kate Grenville, the film is handsome and atmospheric. And the cast, especially Mr. Frey, the fine French actor who was so electrifying in "My Life and Times With Antonin Artaud," brings an anguished seriousness to the roles. 
It's not the actors' fault that their characters don't make psychological sense. Their shrill erotic charades are metaphoric shortcuts in a film that can't be bothered to develop credible characters or tell a complex story. 
"Traps" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and some violence.

‽
‽The November Men‽,‽The clammy paranoid sweat that drips from Paul Williams's film "The November  Men" is so pungent that at moments it makes Oliver Stone's conspiracy theories seem like perfumed, Pollyanna-ish daydreams. Is the movie a joke on Mr. Stone? It's never clear how funny this disjointed satirical thriller intends to be. But its fantasy that a movie about a Presidential assassination plot could trigger the real thing carries the notion of the film maker as political provocateur to ludicrous comic extremes. 
Mr. Williams himself plays Arthur Gwenlyn, an angry leftist director who decides to make a movie about the assassination of President George Bush. ("The  November Men" was completed in 1992 before the election of Bill Clinton.) Instead of recruiting actors to play the conspirators, he enlists a group of malcontents who include two Iraqis, a black nationalist and an emotionally unhinged former Marine sniper named Vincent Duggo (James Andronica), who is signed on as a technical adviser. 
The climax will involve an actual Presidential motorcade making its way through the streets of Los Angeles. Arthur's secret hope is that one of his actors will snap and shoot the President, turning fiction into reality and his movie into a historical document a hundred times more valuable than the Zapruder home movie of John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
"The November Men," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, vacillates between  tautness and mockery with no rhyme or reason. The more comical scenes revolve around Arthur's icy cinematographer and girlfriend, Elizabeth (Leslie Bevis), who becomes so alarmed by his project that she spills the beans to the Secret Service. The most bizarre of the film's many digressions is a dream sequence in which Elizabeth, in dominatrix garb, menaces the Secret Service's chief agent (Beau Starr). 
Spicing up this paranoid stew is a seemingly crazy actor (Rod Ellis) who answers a casting call for someone desperate enough to kill the President. After being rejected for the film, he is discovered surreptitiously videotaping Arthur's activities and persuades the director to make him the project's official documentarian. 
While "The November Men" has some taut individual sequences, it is so infatuated with its own movie-within-a movie structure that it never settles down to tell a coherent story. Except for Duggo, who is played intensely by Mr.  Andronica (the film's screenwriter), the movie's possible assassins are the shallowest caricatures. And having led off with an angry political message, the  film abandons political rhetoric to poke nasty fun at self-important Secret Service agents and the loonies who make their occupation stimulating. 
The movie's wittiest conceit is a running visual joke about film making itself. It continually confuses the camera with a long-distance telescopic gun sight. In today's climate of media overkill, it suggests, there isn't much difference between shooting a movie and shooting a President. What matters is keeping your target in focus. 
THE NOVEMBER MEN Directed by Paul Williams; written by James Andronica; director of photography,  Susan Emerson; music by Scott Thomas Smith; produced by Mr. Williams and Rodney  Bryon Ellis; released by Northern Arts Entertainment. At the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This  film is not rated.

‽Dead Beat‽,‽Kit (Bruce Ramsey), the Elvis-worshiping teen-ager who generates most of the laughs in Adam Dubov's twisted comic spoof, "Dead Beat," is a junior Don Juan who will stop at nothing to make a conquest. Preparing for a date, he spends hours in front of the mirror slicking back unruly strands in his oversized pompadour and daubing on thick Elvis-style eye makeup. Kit has never been known to remove his boots, which elevate him several inches up to average height. 
Once on a date, Kit, if necessary, will fake a terminal illness to gain female sympathy. In one of his favorite tricks, he surreptitiously applies glycerine eye drops to elicit stage tears at the perfect opportune moment. 
After breaking nearly every female heart in his high school, Kit finally meets his match in Kirsten (Natasha Gregson Wagner), a hysterical blonde who is even more manipulative than he. He first sees her at a swimming pool where, for attention-getting kicks, she pretends to drown in a diving accident. 
When Kit presents his first gift to Kirsten, a $100 wig, she swoons with happiness. "Oh, Kit, you do love me!" she squeals. 
"Dead Beat," which opens today at Cinema Village, is set in Albuquerque in 1965 and has imitation 60's pop songs to go with its sendup of vintage teen-age fashions and manners. But having established its satiric premise, the movie dashes around in too many directions at once. 
One character, a wild girl named Martha (Sara Gilbert) who precedes Kirsten in Kit's affections, inexplicably disappears from the film until the very end. And before long, Kirsten herself abruptly vanishes. 
The events of the story are seen through the eyes of Rudy (Balthazar Getty), Kit's trusty sidekick, who earns Kirsten's eternal hatred by amassing an incriminating dossier on her past. Rudy abases himself in his pursuit of Donna (Meredith Salenger), one of Kit's rejects. Unbeknownst to Rudy, Kirsten takes revenge on him by spreading the rumor that he likes only anal sex, and he mopes through the rest of the movie bewildered by the cold shoulder he receives. 
The story takes a ghoulish turn when Kit takes Kirsten into the desert and shows her the body of a girl he claims to have killed. His entrusting her with his deepest, darkest secret, he says, is the ultimate proof of his love. 
It is right around here that the movie loses its grip. By carrying the petty romantic crises of 60's teen-age movies to absurdist gothic extremes, this would-be cult film stretches them way beyond the breaking point. DEAD BEAT Directed by Adam Dubov; written by Janice Shapiro and Mr. Dubov; director of photography, Nancy Schreiber; edited by Lorraine Salk; music supervision by Sharal Churchill, with score by Anton Sanko; produced by George Moffly and Christopher Lambert; released by Northern Arts Releasing. At Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 92 minutes. This film is rated R. WITH: Bruce Ramsey (Kit), Balthazar Getty (Rudy), Natasha Gregson Wagner (Kirsten), Meredith Salenger (Donna) and Sara Gilbert (Martha).

‽Heaven's a Drag‽,‽"Heaven's a Drag" is a film so determined to find inspirational uplift in the AIDS crisis that it seesaws wildly between witty drawing-room comedy and tear-drenched pathos. One minute it is dispensing Noel Coward-style repartee; the next it is awash in grief. Its final scene is a sentimental leave-taking complete with a golden archangel and a flock of seraphim. 
While navigating between these extremes, the movie also finds time to offer politically pointed vignettes on homophobia and gay-bashing. With all its inconsistencies of tone, "Heaven's a Drag" is still clumsily endearing for the way it wears its heart on its sleeve. You might describe it as "Longtime Companion" meets "Topper," with a dollop of "La Cage aux Folles." 
The two main characters, Simon (Thomas Arklie) and Mark (Ian Williams), are lovers who live together in London in a sexually open arrangement. Simon, a handsome television repairman and installer of satellite dishes, has kept his sexuality a secret from his virulently anti-gay job partner, Dogger (John Altman). Mark, who keeps house during the day, does a drag act at night in a gay club. Mark is H.I.V.-positive, and Simon, who is negative, is unable to face up to his lover's health problems. An early scene shows Mark watching a documentary on the AIDS Memorial Quilt and silently crying while sewing his own patch. 
"Heaven's a Drag," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is remarkably matter-of-fact about Mark's illness, whose progress he describes to Simon in chipper-sounding phone messages. Then suddenly Mark is dead. Simon, who remains dry-eyed, stores away his lover's possessions and plunges into the life of a swinging gay bachelor. 
But shrugging off the past is not so easy. Strange occurrences begin sabotaging Simon's romantic encounters. Arriving home one evening, he is greeted by Mark, who proves to be invisible and inaudible to everyone else. To Simon's chagrin, the ectoplasmic Mark announces that he is moving back in. What follows are typical invisible-man gags, like the scene in which a visitor, watching a vacuum cleaner appear to propel itself around the living room, is told it is a new computerized model that responds to spoken directions. 
"Heaven's a Drag" is the debut film of Peter Mackenzie Litten, an English film maker, with a bluntly straightforward style. The screenplay, by Johnny Byrne, shows a knack for droll drawing-room dialogue. "I might as well be dead for all you care," Mark complains. "But you are dead," Simon reminds him. "Trust you to nitpick," Mark retorts. 
The badinage soon turns serious, and issues that were never spoken of when Mark was alive are finally aired. The movie turns into a soul-searching exploration of unequal love between partners, repressed grief and the legacy of Simon's bitter relationship with his dead father. 
"Heaven's a Drag" is very broadly acted, with buffoonish comic relief provided by Dilly Keane as the couple's eccentric upstairs neighbor, and Tony Slattery as her stammering, radical boyfriend. 
What gives the film its heart is Mr. Williams's portrayal of Mark. Spilling over with humor, vulnerability and feistiness, his performance almost succeeds in balancing the stylistic seesaw. 
HEAVEN'S A DRAG  Directed by Peter Mackenzie Litten; written by Johnny Byrne; music by Kiki Dee, Elton John, and Acoustic Alchemy; produced by Gary Fitzpatrick; released by First Run Features.

‽
‽Arizona Dream‽,‽The 1992 film "Arizona Dream" arrived on the home video market with traffic-stopping credits and a badly checkered past. Starring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway long before the more staid (believe it or not) "Don Juan DeMarco" made the world safe for that pairing, it also features Jerry Lewis, Lili Taylor, Michael J. Pollard and Paulina Porizkova. Not to mention an arrowtooth halibut, a set of homemade flying machines and various sled dogs, who play prominent roles in the characters' reveries. As do the crop-duster sequence from "North by Northwest" and a willful red balloon. 
"Arizona Dream" was directed by the Bosnian film maker Emir Kusturica ("When Father Was Away on Business"), who apparently intended it as a festive, 2-hour-and-22-minute delirium about, among other things, American enterprise. Pink Cadillacs and pink flamingos are among its other visual motifs; Mr. Lewis wears a lot of pink and is made a walking symbol of go-getterism. He could have been an easy target, but he's appreciated in ways that accentuate this film's unexpected generosity, its greatest virtue. 
Even so, Mr. Kusturica had no idea what he was up against where American enterprise was concerned. In pointless attempts to market "Arizona Dream" for middle-of-the-road audiences, his film was shrunk down to two hours and jettisoned by its American distributor, Warner Brothers. Though it did passable business in Europe, "Arizona Dream" has taken three years to reach a movie theater in New York. It finally opens today at the Film Forum, which has gamely resurrected the full-length version. 
"Did I really make a film that they couldn't even release?" Mr. Kusturica asked rhetorically two weeks ago, only hours before he won his second Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival (for "Underground").  No, but he didn't exactly make it easy. In its clumsily truncated form, adapted to video dimensions that butcher the director's wide-screen compositions, "Arizona Dream" verges on the demented, impervious to any conventions of cookie-cutter film making. But even at its full length, showing off a more seductive rhythm and the buoyant humanism that is this director's calling card, it remains as ripe a subject for therapy as for criticism. 
What works best for "Arizona Dream" is that its lunacy is so liberating. Mr. Kusturica often favors a broad, rowdy mess over anything more structured, but he can galvanize his actors in captivatingly weird ways. Ms. Dunaway hasn't seemed this girlish since she was a girl.  (She's supposed to be playing the one bona fide nut in the film, but that's a fine distinction.) Mr. Depp, no stranger to risky roles, this time cheerfully wears a white skirt around his neck while imitating a chicken. Ms. Taylor sits and plays the accordion with scene-stealing ferocity, and has no trouble explaining that she'd like to be reincarnated as a turtle. There may be a few too many verses of "Besame Mucho" in the background while all this unfolds, but restraint is not on anyone's mind. 
In this slapstick psychodrama with a heavy dash of magical realism, Mr. Depp plays Axel Blackmar, the principal dreamer. He lives in New York, fervently imagines Alaska and winds up in Arizona at the behest of his uncle, Leo Sweetie (Mr. Lewis), who wants to do him a favor.  Leo thinks he can save Axel from a life of fish counting (that's what he does for a living, working for the Department of Fish and Game) by making him a car salesman. 
But Axel cares about fish with this film's brand of passion: "Sometimes I'll look straight into a pair of fish eyes and I'll see my whole life. That's something only fish can show us, and I love 'em." 
Once Axel winds up beached in Arizona, Mr. Kusturica is armed with more of the things only fish can show us, and he eagerly piles them on. Axel hooks up with Paul (Vincent Gallo), who's movie-mad enough to parrot some of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino's best-loved lines and to mimic the "North by Northwest" crop-dusting scene as a stand-up comedy act. (Try to imagine that.) He's also drawn in by both Elaine (Ms. Dunaway) and Grace (Ms. Taylor), a mother and stepdaughter. The women's rivalry surfaces during a dinner-table scene involving strangulation by pantyhose and a live turtle. Don't ask. 
If you're in the right mood -- the same kind of last-gasp 3 A.M. mood in which Mr. Kusturica and David Atkins, who wrote the screenplay together, may have concocted this mad mixture -- then "Arizona Dream" has enough patterns and parallels to hold interest, even if it successfully avoids all traces of reason. It may be necessary to be an arrowtooth halibut to follow it further. 
Working on unfamiliar terrain, without the ballast of Bosnian history that gives such heft to "Underground," Mr. Kusturica meanders along at an obvious disadvantage.  Even so, his "Arizona Dream" is enjoyably adrift, a wildly off-the-wall reverie. It's more than a fish out of water. 
ARIZONA DREAM  Directed by Emir Kusturica; written by Mr. Kusturica and David Atkins; director of photography, Vilko Filac; edited by Andrlja Zafranovic; music by Goran Bregovic; produced by Claudie Ossard and Richard Brick; released by Kit Parker Films. At the Film Forum, 209 Houston Street, South Village. Running time: 142 minutes. This film is not rated.

‽
‽The Madness of King George‽,‽All the world's a stage for King George III, the royally irrepressible ruler who holds sway throughout "The Madness of King George." While there's much to admire in Nicholas Hytner's splendid screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's neo-Shakespearean play ("The Madness of George III"), this exuberant tragicomedy is first and foremost a superb showcase. The monarch is a corker, and he commands almost all the attention. 
Grandly played by Nigel Hawthorne, who repeats his stage role with a stunningly mercurial display of wit, pathos and fiery emotion, this wily King is a figure to be reckoned with even when his powers decline. It was under the stormy reign of George III (1760-1810) that England's monarchy lost a substantial degree of its authority to Parliament, while England itself lost the United States (or "the place we mustn't mention," as it's called in the film). As for George himself, he began losing his reason periodically in 1788, when the film takes place, and was deemed quite mad during the last 10 years of his monarchy. 
Mr. Bennett's drama finds him at a critical juncture, still in control but well aware of the "catalogue of regal nonconformities" he presents to courtiers and loved ones. For all his comic fireworks, Mr. Hawthorne poignantly captures the King's understanding that his power may be slipping, that he may not be able to halt that process, and that a long list of adversaries eagerly awaits his decline. 
The star, the film maker and the playwright find something universal in the ways this embattled man fends off the inevitable, using every behavioral weapon in his arsenal to keep his enemies at bay. In the process, they also enjoy the essential hollowness of keeping up appearances in royal fashion. "Smile at the people," King George exhorts his family, with a puckishness that certainly resonates today. "Wave to them. Let them see that we're happy. That's why we're here." 
The early part of the film offers broadly entertaining displays of how this cagey, mocking King uses royal prerogatives to frazzle those around him. There is the music recital he attends, sweeping in to hear "Greensleeves" played on bells and then declaring: "Fascinating stuff, what-what? Let's have it again!" There is the fact that he refuses to let pregnant women be seated during this cultural ordeal, announcing: "If everybody who's having a baby wants to sit down, next thing it'll be everybody with gout." 
There are his ways of addressing the Queen sweetly as "Mrs. King," though he is also capable of accusing her of sleeping with their son. There is his sudden decision to rouse his servants for a run at sunrise, announcing: "Six hours' sleep is enough for a man, seven for a woman and eight for a fool!" There is the visit to a barnyard where the King, who regards himself as a farmer, has a nice, companionable chat with a tiny pig. 
Events like these convince those closest to King George that it may be time to question his authority. And Mr. Hytner, the prodigiously talented stage director (of "Carousel" and "Miss Saigon"), who directed "King George" for London's Royal National Theater and now makes a vigorous film debut, has no trouble explicating this chicanery in colorful, entertaining fashion. "The Madness of King George" mixes the ebullience of "Tom Jones" with a pop-theatrical royal back-stabbing that is reminiscent of films like "The Lion in Winter." That makes it a deft, mischievous, beautifully acted historical drama with exceptionally broad appeal. 
Mr. Bennett explicates a convoluted governmental crisis in ways that are both lucid and sly. Challenged on all sides by Prime Minister William Pitt (Julian Wadham); a Member of Parliament, Charles James Fox (Jim Carter), and his own son, the scheming Prince of Wales (a flamboyantly memorable Rupert Everett), this King even winds up reading Shakespeare aloud with his Lord Chancellor one day. " 'King Lear' -- is that wise?" asks the Lord Chancellor, who has been enlisted to play Cordelia. "I had no idea what it was about, sir," the King's physician replies. 
Mr. Bennett certainly knows what "King Lear" is about, but he is content with only an echo or two; for all its intimations of loss, "The Madness of King George" is largely lighthearted. Much of this film devotes itself to subsidiary matters like the abysmal medical practices to which the King is subjected once his condition becomes cause for concern. Typical of the film's contemporary asides is the declaration by one of the King's aides, a man named Fortnum, that he's tired of bedpan duty and thinks going off to Piccadilly to start a provision company might be a good career move. This film loves making hay out of hindsight. 
"The Madness of King George" begins blithely and takes on substance as the King appreciates his own frailty, especially after he is forced to become a patient of Dr. Willis (Ian Holm). This doctor effectively scares the King back to his senses, understanding the problem at a time when ordinary doctors regarded even a physical examination as an impertinence. (The King's malady was eventually thought to be porphyria, a metabolic imbalance whose symptoms include mental disturbance.) Dr. Willis remarks that there are unhinged individuals who imagine themselves to be king. "He is the King," he says of his royal patient. "Where shall his fancy take refuge?" 
As Mr. Hytner and Mr. Bennett follow that fancy so engagingly, "The Madness of King George" also thrives on the talents of a fine supporting cast. Helen Mirren makes a patient and formidable Queen, tolerating even the King's overt lunges at Lady Pembroke (Amanda Donohoe), her lady-in-waiting. "Did we ever forget ourselves?" King George asks Lady Pembroke, during a spell when the madness has subsided and he can assess his life with uncharacteristic calm. "Because if we did, I should like to remember." 
As that suggests, this film eventually sounds grace notes that signal acceptance and understanding, even of facts that were heretofore unbearable. "We must get used to it," King George eventually sighs about the nation formed from his American colonies. "I have known stranger things. I once saw a sheep with five legs."

‽Street Fighter‽,‽If Jean-Claude Van Damme's newest action-adventure film, "Street Fighter," is remembered for anything, it will probably be for Raul Julia's flaming portrayal of Gen. M. Bison, an international villain of Hitlerian proportions. An insane warlord in the make-believe South Asian country of Shadaloo, General Bison is hellbent on world conquest. One of his tools is a lethal laboratory-engineered soldier, programmed to kill, who looks like a Frankenstein monster and speaks in an electronic drone. 
General Bison has tricks up his sleeve that are not deployed until the movie's chaotic final action sequence. The most spectacular is a pair of electromagnetic shoes that enable him to levitate and fly around like Superman while proclaiming himself a god. This role was Mr. Julia's final screen performance (the movie is dedicated to him). And the actor gives it his all, widening his eyes into an electric glare of cartoonish ferocity, swishing his cape and cackling fiendishly. 
Mr. Julia's nostril-flaring campiness befits a film that is the latest action-adventure movie to be spun off from a video game. Like other movies that originated as toy software, "Street Fighter," which opened yesterday, does not feel obliged to do much more than create a live-action simulation of a video game's rhythms. The movie is fast and jerky, with no narrative continuity and lots of candy-colored pyrotechnics and characters who talk in cartoon-balloon fragments, usually in a monotone. 
Mr. Van Damme plays Colonel Guile, an Allied Nations commander who leads a party of soldiers into Shadaloo City to rescue a group of imprisoned relief workers whom General Bison hopes to ransom for $20 billion. Subsidiary characters include a television reporter with surprising martial arts skills (Ming-Na Wen) and two young adventurers (Damian Chapa and Byron Mann) who keep getting in and out of scrapes. 
If Steven E. de Souza, who wrote and directed "Street Fighter," has captured the look and mood of a video game, the film is an otherwise dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue. As Mr. Van Damme fumbles through his part, you are likely to find yourself staring at the big lump on the right side of his forehead and wondering how it got there. 
"Street Fighter" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It is loaded with violence, but mostly of the cartoonishly bloodless variety.  STREET FIGHTER Written and directed by Steven E. de Souza, based on the Capcom Video Game "Street Fighter II"; director of photography, William A. Fraker; edited by Anthony Redman, Robert F.

‽I.Q.‽,‽The nice thing about "I.Q." is that its intelligence doesn't stop at the title. In a romantic comedy that mingles brilliant physicists with auto mechanics, everybody manages to seem smart. Most of all Fred Schepisi, the director, who has figured out how to get the absolute best out of his leading actors. Mr. Schepisi is so clever that his audience will have no trouble believing Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein, and that's just for starters. 
"I.Q.," which opens on Christmas Day, features wonderful comic performances from both Meg Ryan, who is newly calm and composed here, and Tim Robbins, who is all dimples and slow, easy delivery. Oozing total sexual confidence, Mr. Robbins plays a mechanic who really likes comets, and Ms. Ryan plays a scientist who doesn't much like auto mechanics. And happens to be Einstein's niece. Another thing Mr. Schepisi makes easy to believe is that when these two meet, they fall instantly in love. 
The point, alarmingly, is that brains aren't everything. "I.Q." is poised to announce that the heart matters more than the head, and that romance is such an equalizer it puts the theory of relativity on an equal footing with fixing cars. But "I.Q." is so smart that it doesn't really do much with this dumbing-down angle. It prefers to keep its characters warm, bright and interesting as long as it can. 
The humor can be supremely sly, and all the more gratifying since it avoids the danger of treating Einstein as a walking sight gag. Einstein to Ed, Mr. Robbins's mechanic, as Einstein hatches a scheme to throw Ed and Catherine (Ms. Ryan) together: "Are you thinking what I am thinking?" Ed, thoughtfully: "Well, what would be the odds of that happening?" 
Set in an idyllic-looking Princeton, N.J., during the Eisenhower years, "I.Q." is also a visual pleasure. Ms. Ryan has been smashingly costumed as the kind of cool, elegant blonde who would have driven Alfred Hitchcock wild. And Mr. Matthau's Einstein, who bumbles around town adorably in the company of his elderly, professorial cronies (including Gene Saks and Lou Jacobi), is no less attractive in his own shaggy way. As for Mr. Robbins, he does a mean Marlon Brando impersonation and a convincing job of sweeping not only Catherine but also the scientists off their feet. 
As written by Andy Breckman and Michael Leeson, "I.Q." is able to generate loads of good will before it runs into story problems. There's a central contrivance about making Ed look like a brilliant physicist so that Catherine will accept him, and this gimmick eventually overwhelms the romance, leaving the second half of the story rather flat.  By the time the film actually brings President Eisenhower to Princeton, "I.Q." has become a little silly in terms of plot. But the main characters are so strong that the film's gentle pleasures persist even when its focus drifts. Ed, gazing at the stars: "Do you know why a comet's tail always points away from the sun?" Catherine: "Yes!" He: "Me too." 
The film's biggest surprise is Ms. Ryan, who is seldom this serene. She's a much more captivating comic actress without busy mannerisms, and when she beams in this film, the sun really shines. One of the film's scientist characters says it best, speaking in the idiom that the screenplay renders most deftly: "Wonderful to the power of three." 
"I.Q." is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and a number of flirty double-entendres. I.Q.

‽Little Women‽,‽"Some books are so familiar reading them is like being home again," Jo March observes in the new film version of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel. She's talking about Shakespeare, but we all know "Little Women" is a book like that, one of the most seductively nostalgic novels any child ever discovers. As the gold standard for American girlhood, it lingers in our collective consciousness as a wistful, inspiring memory. Ladies, get out your hand-hemmed handkerchiefs for the loveliest "Little Women" ever on screen. 
Gillian Armstrong's enchantingly pretty film is so potent that it prompts a rush of recognition from the opening frame. There in Concord, Mass., are the March girls and their noble Marmee, gathered around the hearth for a heart-rendingly quaint Christmas Eve. Stirring up a flurry of familial warmth, Ms. Armstrong instantly demonstrates that she has caught the essence of this book's sweetness and cast her film uncannily well, finding sparkling young actresses who are exactly right for their famous roles. The effect is magical. And for all its unimaginable innocence, the story has a touching naturalness this time. 
Remember that these are fresh-faced teen-agers who wassail and embroider. They put on little plays for at-home entertainment; they live out the pieties of "Pilgrim's Progress"; they talk passionately about music and literature. ("Your spelling's atrocious," Jo snaps at Amy, her princessy younger sister. "Your Latin's absurd.") The Marches' rare neighborliness and generosity are enough to heartstrings by summoning a world more benign than our own. Even when this film becomes family viewing on home video, watched with a passivity so different from the no-tech, active atmosphere of the March household, its idealism will come through. 
The direction by Ms. Armstrong, who long ago summoned memories of "Little Women" with "My Brilliant Career" (1978), is sentimental without being saccharine. And the film maker is too savvy to tell this story in a cultural and historical vacuum. So this "Little Women" has ways of winking at its audience, most notably when the tomboyish, intellectually ambitious Jo March reveals that she has cut off and sold her mane of hair. "Jo, how could you?" wails Amy. "Your one beauty!" Well, this Jo is Winona Ryder and the joke is that she has beauty to spare, along with enough vigor to dim memories of Katharine Hepburn in the now badly dated 1933 George Cukor version. Ms. Armstrong reinvents "Little Women" for present-day audiences without ever forgetting it's a story with a past. 
Once the March sisters have made their introductory embraces -- and these are girls who embrace, never just hug -- the four familiar personalities emerge. Ms. Ryder, whose banner year also includes a fine comic performance in "Reality Bites," plays Jo with spark and confidence. Her spirited presence gives the film an appealing linchpin, and she plays the self-proclaimed "man of the family" with just the right staunchness. 
The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933. Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of "Interview With the Vampire," is a little vamp with a big future. 
Amy undergoes a jarring personality change when, after a four-year forward leap in the story, she grows up into the more ladylike Samantha Mathis. Meanwhile, Trini Alvarado captures the ladylike composure of Meg, the oldest and most marriageable of the sisters. Miss Alcott joked that the second half of her book ought to be called "Wedding Marches" for its way of realizing these young women's ambitions with a quick succession of nuptials and babies. 
As written by Robin Swicord, this "Little Women" works overtime to balance such recidivist plotting with the occasional feminist mouthful, mostly spoken by Susan Sarandon's exceedingly prim mother figure. This version emphasizes the "marm" in "Marmee" with an excess of instructional dialogue that echoes the thinking of Alcott's progressive Concord parents. So the film makes reference to transcendentalism and raises Marmee's political consciousness a few notches. ("I so wish I could give my girls a just world. I know you'll make it a better place.") While the sentiments are admirable, the stridency can be irritating, especially since the film's moral tenor is never far from its surface. 
There are also men in "Little Women." As they were on the page, they're a bit secondary. Ms. Armstrong deals with that difficulty by casting attractive actors to breathe life into shapeless roles. So the handsome Christian Bale makes a dreamboat out of Laurie, the boy next door to the March family. (If viewers have trouble understanding why Jo wouldn't marry him, Miss Alcott's readers had the same problem.) Gabriel Byrne does his best with the thankless, tedious part of Professor Bhaer, the shy older man who courts Jo and is one of the book's nonautobiographical figures. 
Eric Stoltz makes a puckish John Brooke, Laurie's tutor, even if he's the one actor here who seems to have wandered in from a later century. The March girls also have a father, but he is away as a Civil War chaplain when the story begins. Not even the joyful tears that mark his return make it credible that there really is an important man around this house. 
Speaking of tears, Claire Danes is given the job of coaxing forth great torrents in the role of Beth, the doomed angel of the March family. While no reader of Miss Alcott's ever saw Beth through the valley of the shadow of death dry-eyed, the film's Beth is its one relatively ineffectual character. Ms. Danes, the disarming star of television's "My So-Called Life," does a fine job. But Beth is a quiet character, and the film has become too diffuse by the time it bids her farewell. Once the sisters leave home and hearth, Ms. Armstrong has more trouble keeping the story's strands together than she did when the girls were part of a single pretty picture. 
"Little Women" also has a larger visual attractiveness, with picturesque views of Orchard House (the real Alcott home) and pristine, snowy Canadian scenery to suggest the rest of Concord. Indoor scenes have the warm glow of candlelight, and the production design is appealing without excess, in keeping with the Marches' limited means. The film's buoyant good looks stop just this side of trouble. One more violet painted on a teacup would have been too much. 
"Little Women" is rated PG. It includes violence, profanity, graphic sexual situations and . . . Not! It's the most innocent movie in town. LITTLE WOMEN  Directed by Gillian Armstrong; written by Robin Swicord, based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott; director of photography, Geoffrey Simpson; edited by Nicholas Beauman; music by Thomas Newman; production designer, Jan Roelfs; produced by Denise Di Novi; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time: 115 minutes. This film is rated PG. WITH: Winona Ryder (Jo March), Gabriel Byrne (Friedrich Bhaer), Trini Alvarado (Meg March), Samantha Mathis (older Amy March), Kirsten Dunst (younger Amy March), Claire Danes (Beth March), Christian Bale (Laurie), Eric Stoltz (John Brooke), John Neville (Mr. Laurence), Mary Wickes (Aunt March) and Susan Sarandon (Mrs. March)

‽Mixed Nuts‽,‽The dead man wears tennis shoes and stands on his head, covered with branches and disguised as a Christmas tree. "Mixed Nuts," Nora Ephron's frenetic comedy about a suicide hot line in Venice, Calif., is about as funny as that corpse, and about as natural. Adapted from the French film "Le Pere Noel Est une Ordure," it has a farcical tone that loses everything in translation, with only hand-waving, door-slamming and zany costumes left behind. A title song incorporating the names of nut varieties is only one of the film's desperate ploys. 
Ms. Ephron is generally so much funnier than this that "Mixed Nuts" leaves a mystifying impression. Not even its screenplay, which she adapted with her sister Delia Ephron, shows much comic style. The film's modus operandi is unleashing a horde of not-so-cute eccentrics in a confined setting and encouraging them all to talk, fuss and gesticulate at the same time. This leads to a scene with five people crammed noisily into the same bathroom, four of them oblivious and the fifth using the toilet. 
The revelers here include Steve Martin as a lonely-guy suicide prevention worker along with Rita Wilson, a nervous wallflower type who has to go sit in the bathtub, fully clothed, whenever life becomes overwhelming. Madeline Kahn plays their boss as a variation on her character in "The Sisters Rosensweig," which would be fine if the film were less hysterical and didn't require her to become wackily unstrung. 
Juliette Lewis, as a pregnant shop owner with a husband dressed as Santa Claus, is as funny as this comedy gets, which is a meaningful measure. If you can't guess whether she will go into labor at the height of the story's New Year's Eve frenzy, you haven't been paying attention. 
Staged as pure fluff without an ounce of ballast, "Mixed Nuts" succeeds only in getting its cast into Halloween-caliber crazy costumes by the time it's over. There is also a soundtrack full of pop Christmas songs, which don't do for this film what Jimmy Durante did for Ms. Ephron's "Sleepless in Seattle." 
The cast (including Rob Reiner, Robert Klein, Anthony LaPaglia and Liev Shreiber as a very large transvestite) inspires good will whenever possible. But in the case of Adam Sandler, it's out of the question. Mr. Sandler dresses as a gondolier, plays the ukulele and sings stupid little nonsense songs in an irritating falsetto. If you didn't know this was part of his established shtick on "Saturday Night Live," you might think "Mixed Nuts" was simply crazy. 
"Mixed Nuts" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, sexual references and jokey violence. MIXED NUTS Directed by Nora Ephron; written by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron, based on the French film "Le Pere Noel Est une Ordure"; director of photography, Sven Nykvist; edited by Robert Reitano; music by George Fenton; production designer, Bill Groom; produced by Paul Junger Witt, Tony Thomas and Joseph Hartwick; released by Tri-Star Pictures. Running time: 97 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

‽
‽Camilla‽,‽Jessica Tandy's graceful presence in one of her final roles gives "Camilla" a valedictory grandeur. Though this is by far the lesser of two new films dedicated to Tandy's memory (the other is "Nobody's Fool," opening next week), it's the one that gives this great, unforgettable actress the more substantial showcase. "Camilla" spends an awful lot of time admiring Tandy in the title role, but that admiration is deserved. She moves enchantingly through an otherwise treacly film that wouldn't work without her. 
Tandy, who died in September at the age of 85, approached this film with daring and surprising ease. While "Camilla" reveres its heroine, hers is hardly a standard great-lady role. Not every octogenarian actress would be game for skinny-dipping, fishing, violin playing and a wonderfully tender bedroom scene with her real-life husband. When Tandy and Hume Cronyn finish the film with a courtly scene on a beach at sunset, they provide a gallant, heartbreaking flourish. 
As played by Tandy, Camilla is a free spirit whose wit and vitality are undimmed by age. She was once a concert violinist, and she is full of grand, untrustworthy stories of her musical heyday. Those memories are coaxed forth by the arrival of Freda (Bridget Fonda) on the Georgia island where Camilla now lives a sheltered life. Freda is an aspiring musician, which gives her and Camilla rather too much reason to talk about their art. 
The two women become friends through ungainly plot contrivances that soon separate Freda from her insensitive husband (Elias Koteas) and send her and Camilla on a trip to Canada. Ms. Fonda, whose character is supposed to be discovering herself, performs a couple of wispy musical numbers and generally gets the worse half of this arrangement. 
The trip revolves around Camilla, who flaunts her joie de vivre every chance she gets. This character's flamboyance could easily have been unbearable, but Tandy fills her with tact and good humor. She is as comfortable pretending to have known impossible celebrities, from Gandhi to the Duke of Nottingham, as she is gently reciting a John Masefield poem to Mr. Cronyn. Tandy even does a credible job of pretending to play Brahms's Violin Concerto, which Camilla regards as an essential challenge and the film treats as a metaphor for her overall determination. 
Dressed strikingly by Milena Canonero and Elisabetta Beraldo, Tandy moves graciously through a range of escapades, ending up in glamorous white satin for a performance of the Brahms in Canada. Mr. Cronyn, as a violin maker who is Camilla's long-lost love, gallantly affirms the film's emphasis on both music and romance. Ms. Fonda glows prettily and is a soothing presence whenever the film doesn't require her to assert artistic pretensions. There is a picture of Frida Kahlo in Freda's music studio, where she writes songs with lyrics like "If I could give you anything, I'd give you back yourself." 
Also in "Camilla," which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is Graham Greene, as the kind of colorful eccentric who has been perking up road movies ever since Jack Nicholson joined Ms. Fonda's father, Peter, and Dennis Hopper in "Easy Rider." Mr. Greene doesn't do much more than create a detour and provide brief comic relief, but it's welcome. Maury Chaykin, as Camilla's son, a crass film-business type, is less charming. As directed by Deepa Mehta and written by Paul Quarrington, this mild, uneven Canadian film gets by on charm alone, and it is lucky to share some of Tandy's enduring luster. 
"Camilla" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, brief nudity and very discreet sexual situations. CAMILLA  Directed by Deepa Mehta; written by Paul Quarrington; director of photography, Guy Dufaux; edited by Barry Farrell; music by Daniel Lanois; costumes, Milena Canonero and Elisabetta Beraldo; production designer, Sandra Kybartas; produced by Christina Jennings and Simon Relph; released by Miramax Films. At 68th Street Playhouse, 68th Street and Third Avenue, Manhattan. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH: Jessica Tandy (Camilla Cara), Bridget Fonda (Freda Lopez), Elias Koteas (Vince Lopez), Maury Chaykin (Harold Cara), Hume Cronyn (Ewald) and Graham Greene (Hunt Weller) 
‽
‽Nell‽,‽How fitting that Jodie Foster, in "Nell," should play a free-spirited woman who dances to her own secret music. Ms. Foster has carved out just that role for herself in Hollywood, choosing unusual material and largely avoiding the mainstream. Her independence has been impressive enough to suggest that "Nell," the first film from Ms. Foster's production company, Egg, would be subtler and riskier than ordinary fare. 
And "Nell" is the work of Michael Apted, a thoughtful director ("Coal Miner's Daughter," "Gorillas in the Mist") who understands strong heroines and exotic places. With its isolated North Carolina setting and its title character, a mysterious young woman raised without any experience of contemporary civilization, "Nell" promises something well out of the ordinary. 
What's remarkable is how seldom it delivers. For all its technical brilliance, not even Ms. Foster's intense, accomplished performance in the title role holds much surprise. The wild-child story of "Nell" unfolds in unexpectedly predictable ways, clinging fiercely to the banal thought that Nell's innocence makes her purer than anyone else in the story. In light of the stock nature of the two other main characters, a kindly doctor (Liam Neeson) and a levelheaded psychologist (Natasha Richardson), it's hard to argue that point. 
Discovered when her mother dies, Nell is a strange, fearful young woman who speaks her own unintelligible language. When first seen, she makes a startling impression, behaving in a rivetingly feral manner. Scrunching her body like a chimp's, she keens and shrieks in wrenching, absolute, utter terror. These are gestures that send signals: to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where a star's ability to effect such a transformation is traditionally appreciated, and to Drs. Jerome Lovell (Mr. Neeson) and Paula Olsen (Ms. Richardson). These two join forces to help Nell. In the process, wouldn't you know it, they fall in love. 
As this may suggest, "Nell" has its overlay of conventional drama, one that too easily eclipses the fascination of Nell's own story. Before long, Dr. Olsen has set up shop on a cute little houseboat near Nell's cabin, and Dr. Lovell has begun to make house calls. Nell ought to occupy center stage in this story, but too much of the time she is relegated to the capacity of pet primitive. There is the terrible feeling that the doctors will be learning valuable lessons from their experience with Nell. 
Though all three stars are fine actors, only Ms. Foster's Nell commands real interest. And much of that interest derives from her sheer strangeness, whether she is swaying like a tree or speaking passionately in her indecipherable tongue. But gradually, after quite a bit of ecstatic moonlight skinny-dipping to affirm Nell's natural beauty, her thoughts begin to become understandable. What she needs, it turns out, is for the doctors to become a happy couple and love her as their surrogate child. 
The ways that "Nell" unravels its heroine's secrets suggest more entertainment value than science. It is one of the doctors' important missions, for instance, to overcome Nell's terror of men by arranging for her to take a nude swim with Dr. Lovell. "You think I'm planning to abuse the doctor-patient relationship?" he asks indignantly. Well, yes, as a matter of fact. "Nell" would have been more interesting and believable if it owned up to Nell's adult sexuality and also acknowledged that attraction. 
Mr. Neeson labors mightily to breathe life into a weakly written role. (The film is adapted by William Nicholson and Mark Handley from "Idioglossia," a play by Mr. Handley. Mr. Handley and his wife spent six years living, like Nell, in a secluded log cabin without electricity or running water.) He succeeds in radiating charm more easily than he does seriousness, but he does summon enough "Yes, ma'ams" to suit the setting. Rounding out this festival of accents is Ms. Richardson, who has such a familiar career-woman role that her special radiance seldom shines through. Mr. Neeson and Ms. Richardson generate palpable warmth, but their story should have been more secondary. 
Nell herself, rendered too stagy to seem authentically wild, reveals more about Ms. Foster's great skill than about the human condition. With the stark, luminous beauty of a woman in a Walker Evans photograph, Ms. Foster moves through "Nell" with an intensity that needed to be more uncompromising. By the end of this story, Nell has accommodated herself not only to the small-town folk of North Carolina, but to Hollywood, too. 
"Nell" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes brief sexual suggestiveness and considerable nudity. NELL  Directed by Michael Apted; written by William Nicholson and Mark Handley, based on Mr. Handley's play "Idioglossia"; director of photography, Dante Spinotti; edited by Jim Clark; music by Mark Isham; production designer, Jon Hutman; produced by Renee Missel and Jodie Foster; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 112 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH: Jodie Foster (Nell), Liam Neeson (Jerome Lovell) and Natasha Richardson (Paula Olsen) 
‽
‽Queen Margot‽,‽The year: 1572. The place: The Louvre. The aristocracy: Scheming and randy. Patrice Chereau's highly excitable "Queen Margot" presents a slew of double-dealing French noblemen in a struggle for power, fueled by ambition, forbidden passions and religious strife. At its center is a rare beauty who loves purely, suffers exquisitely and poses for many ravishing close-ups before this tale is over. It's a big, splashy role for the regal Isabelle Adjani, the French Garbo. 
Based on an especially convoluted novel by Dumas Pere that has been "unavailable to American readers for nearly a century" (according to a new paperback edition), this is a story involving dozens of potentially confusing historical figures. It incorporates the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, features several present or future kings, and culminates in both a poisoning and a beheading. Be grateful there won't be a quiz when the film is over. 
Mr. Chereau, a noted director of theater and opera, attacks this story of rival Catholic and Huguenot royalty with raging revisionist passion. Assuming his audience is thoroughly conversant with the events described here, he interprets those events with painterly style (the delicately beautiful cinematography is by Philippe Rousselot) coupled with incongruous, heavy turbulence to describe his characters' emotions. 
So here in the 16th century are hand-held camera work, rock star hairdos (the sons of Catherine de Medicis could pass for an aging heavy-metal band) and remarks like "Love me like never before!" and "I need a man tonight." In this overheated atmosphere, the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, involving the slaughter of thousands of Protestants by Catherine's minions, is actually one of the calmer episodes depicted on screen. 
"Queen Margot" has been given data-packed opening titles and a fairly economical version of this massacre, which went on at greater, gorier length when the film was shown at Cannes last spring. Though it runs close to two-and-a-half hours, "Queen Margot" is now considerably clearer and more sedate than it used to be. Still, the story's early scenes introduce an impossible number of significant characters, and confusion clouds much of the story.  The film's hysterical edge also remains jarringly intact. 
"Queen Margot" begins with an arranged marriage between the Catholic Marguerite de Valois, also known as Margot, and the Protestant Henri de Navarre (Daniel Auteuil), who will one day rule France as Henri IV. She has a lover, he has a mistress and the marriage has no meaning except as a method of quelling warfare between religious factions. The match has been engineered by the conniving Catherine, whose antipathy to Henri and his family is expressed in typically casual, anachronistic fashion. When the bride and groom remark about their mothers on the wedding day, Margot says, "Yours hated me." Henri's answer: "Yours killed mine." 
As played by Virna Lisi, whose shockingly witchy appearance and evil mannerisms won her the best-actress prize at Cannes this year, Catherine is indeed someone to be reckoned with. She manipulates the strange, unstable Charles IX (Jean-Hugues Anglade), the King of France, while clearly favoring another of her sons, the Duc d'Anjou (Pascal Greggory). The Duc d'Alencon (Julien Rassam), a third son, is also in his mother's good graces, and the happy family portrait is compounded by strong hints of incest, which also envelop Margot. One of the film's typically impassioned exchanges finds Margot very nearly being raped by her brothers. 
The good news about "Queen Margot" is that Mr. Chereau creates an atmosphere in which his actors' flamboyance can be entertaining.  Ms. Adjani is decked out gloriously to play the very young Margot, a raven-haired vision described by Dumas as a French national treasure.  She preens with all due magnificence, even when, during one of the film's most deliciously ludicrous moments, she roams the streets of Paris wearing a ball gown and a tiny eye mask, trying to pass incognito while searching for a lover. The man she finds, the Comte Joseph-Hyacinthe Boniface de Lerac de la Mole (Vincent Perez), is presented as so noble a figure that religious music sanctifies each Margot-La Mole love scene. 
Mr. Anglade, familiar for his mad gleam in films by Luc Besson and Jean-Jacques Beineix (as well as the recent "Killing Zoe"), is particularly impressive for his intense, unpredictable energy here. Mr. Auteuil, the fascinatingly subtle actor seen in "Jean de Florette" and "Un Coeur en Hiver," helps to anchor the film by making Henri an increasingly interesting figure as the story progresses. As the wicked Anjou, Mr. Greggory smirks insinuatingly in every scene, often to amusing effect. In a film this feverish, nothing less will do. 
"Queen Margot" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes full frontal nudity, sexual situations, much violence and several horrible deaths. QUEEN MARGOT  Written in French (English subtitles) by Daniele Thompson and Patrice Chereau, based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas; directed by Mr. Chereau; director of photography, Philippe Rousselot; edited by Francois Gedigier and Helene Viard; music by Goran Bregovic; production designers, Richard Peduzzi and Olivier Radot; produced by Claude Berri; released by Miramax.

‽Drop Zone‽,‽The most spectacular sequence in John Badham's deftly paced action-adventure film "Drop Zone" applies the esthestics of water ballet to a sky diving exhibition over Washington. In a night sky bursting with fireworks, a team of sky divers wearing illuminated uniforms arranges itself in glowing geometric patterns while plummeting earthward. 
Simultaneously, the movie's villains, a posse of sky diving criminals, is parachuting into the headquarters of the Drug Enforcement Agency. Their mission is to obtain computer information, including identification snapshots of a worldwide network of undercover drug agents, to sell to the leaders of an international drug cartel. The only man who can stop them is Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), a United States marshal who has overcome his fear of heights to pursue the gang in one aerial chase after another. 
"Drop Zone" is the second splashy action-adventure this fall to be set in the world of professional sky diving. In "Terminal Velocity," Charlie Sheen played a sky diving daredevil who rescues Russia's stolen gold reserves from a ruthless gang of former K.G.B. members. If "Drop Zone" has a plot that is only slightly less preposterous, it is more fun. And with the glaring exception of Mr. Snipes's performance, it is also better acted. 
From "Saturday Night Fever" to "American Flyer," Mr. Badham has shown a special knack for capturing the flavor of a tightly knit subculture in scenes that make a closed little world look dynamic and glamorous. With their own in-jokes, exclusive hangouts and roughhouse sense of humor, the sky diving elite, as portrayed in "Drop Zone," have the mystique of flying cowboys. The values of this society are embodied by Pete's sky diving teacher, Jessie (Yancy Butler), an attractive, flippant tomboy with a streak of vulnerability under her bravado. In Ms. Butler's wonderful live-wire performance, Jessie slowly melts from a defiant foe into a true-blue pal as she initiates Pete into the rituals of her profession. 
"Drop Zone" is better than most action-adventure films in presenting secondary characters with dimension. As Ty Moncrief, a corrupt former drug agent who leads the posse, Gary Busey flashes a lethally goofy grin that suggests an antic cowpoke gone rotten. Michael Jeter is equally sharp as Leedy, a whining computer nerd whom Ty bullies into cracking access codes. Corin Nemec as a sky diving novice with daredevil aspirations, and Kyle Secor as a veteran daredevil with a zany streak, contribute to the movie's view of the sport as an elite cult activity. 
Incongruously thrust into this setting, Mr. Snipes drifts through the movie seemingly unsure of whether to play it straight or tongue-in-cheek, and winds up wobbling between the two. In action sequences where the rest of the cast exerts itself intensely, Mr. Snipes remains poker-faced and unruffled. The only times he displays some personality are the moments when he is physically forced into a stressful situation. The most memorable is a sky diving simulation class in which the actor, blown into the air by a vertical wind tunnel, frantically flails around to make sure he doesn't land on his head. 
"Drop Zone" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language and scenes of extreme violence. DROP ZONE  Directed by John Badham; written by Peter Barsocchini and John Bishop, based on a story by Tony Griffin, Guy Manos and Mr. Barsocchini; director of photography, Roy H.

‽
‽Disclosure‽,‽AT the end of her first day at the Seattle offices of Digicom, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore) can be found charging out of her office with her clothes unbuttoned, yelling, "You get back here and finish what you started!" to the man who got away. Beyond making the after-hours cleaning woman wonder just how Meredith landed her powerful position, this sequence is meant to provoke debate. It's also supposed to make "Disclosure," the glossy, techno-torrid film version of Michael Crichton's alarmist novel, look more daring than it really is. 
In the brave new corporate culture of "Disclosure," is Meredith's behavior truly threatening? Are there legions of saucy female executives ready to act this way? Should nice guys like Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) be worried about falling prey to such vixens? And why on earth is Mr. Douglas, an actor known to audiences as Mr. Kinky Philanderer for his steamier roles in "Basic Instinct" and "Fatal Attraction," playing the man who is sexually harassed by Meredith but just says no? 
Actually, Mr. Douglas is here in something more like his "Falling Down" capacity: as an ordinary Joe pushed to the limit by a big, bad, unreasonable world. In this case, unreasonableness is a high-powered babe who chatters meaningfully about "the new compression algorithms" while also saying, "You know, I like all the boys under me to be happy" and "You just lie back and let me be the boss." 
Meredith's subversion of old-fashioned womanly wiles is too stiffly contrived to be upsetting.  But what's legitimately disturbing about "Disclosure" is its utter confusion of technology and eroticism. The computer-age products in this film easily eclipse the human players, and the sex appeal of ingenious engineering is everywhere. Ms. Moore's bold mega-cleavage, presented almost as weaponry during the story's brief, all-important seduction scene, fits in perfectly with this film's other technological marvels. 
Meredith and Tom are supposed to be former lovers, though the film is too perfunctory about mere personal matters to make their past history plausible. A salient fact about their seduction scene is that Meredith has plied Tom with wine; not just any wine, but wine they once liked during a fact-finding mission to the vineyards of Napa Valley. Here is yuppie eros with a vengeance. And here's why "Disclosure" is more bloodless and farfetched than its stars' hotter movie hits. 
"Disclosure" also finds Barry Levinson, a director once known for warmly intimate films about believable people ("Diner," "Tin Men"), severing all apparent ties to the real world. Mr. Levinson's direction is proficient enough to keep the film moving, but it's too soft-edged and fussy to achieve the crisp, efficient manner best used to suggest cleverness and hide a thriller's glaring flaws. Mr. Levinson is never fully at ease with a story that for all its scientific ingenuity, barely has two dimensions. 
The real star of "Disclosure" is the business-world fantasy that is Digicom, an environment the film tries to make more inviting than any of its human characters. With production design (by Neil Spisak) almost as fancy as that of his overblown "Toys," Mr. Levinson confines the film to offices so casually, staggeringly sophisticated that the viewer may crave a job as a forest ranger before this story is over. 
The correct language for this workplace is so chock-full of layman-daunting jargon (a Crichton hallmark) that the actors' biggest challenge is to sound sentient while speaking. But it's never easy to suppose any of them has more than 10 percent of an idea of what he or she is talking about. As the film's confusing yet simple-minded denouement reveals, no characters here are as smart as their talk about milliseconds and prototypes makes them sound. 
Whether smugly delivering a corporate presentation or discussing a database while on her exercise machine, Ms. Moore is overweening enough to annoy audiences as a boss they'd love to hate. Certainly she has that effect on Tom even before she pounces on him, since Meredith has supplanted Tom at the company.  "You used to have fun with a girl," another businessman mutters darkly aboard the ferry Tom takes to work. "Nowadays she probably wants your job." 
"Disclosure" takes only one work week to hand Meredith her comeuppance, set up a scheme about a corporate merger and let Tom reassert himself in the natural order of things. But the week is not otherwise a busy one. This film really has only two big sequences: the harassment interlude, which isn't the show stopper it promises to be, and a scene that sends Tom into a virtual-reality corridor to look through top-secret company records. Children would enjoy the second episode, which is rife with special effects, if they weren't in danger of being permanently damaged by the first. 
Understanding a virtual-reality corridor isn't a prerequisite for following the film, but patience is.  Much of the rest is talky and uneventful, with legal maneuverings and corporate strategies substituting for more energetic drama. The film's biggest fun comes from watching Tom trying to convince his wife, Susan (Caroline Goodall), that his misadventure with Meredith was no big deal. "I'm so old-fashioned I greet my subordinates with handshakes," Susan says. 
Roma Maffia's performance as Tom's straight-talking lawyer is another highlight. Donald Sutherland has some sly moments as the company's suave boss, particularly in a scene that makes him part of Tom's nightmare. Dennis Miller and Nicholas Sadler play two amiable lower-echelon computer nerds, with Mr.  Sadler's resemblance to Kurt Cobain accentuated to suit the Seattle setting. But "Disclosure" hardly needed to be any trendier than it already is. 
"Disclosure" was adapted by Paul Attanasio with considerably less subtlety than he brought to writing "Quiz Show," but that bluntness is traceable to Mr. Crichton. The storytelling of "Disclosure" is too forced and polemical to be on a par with better Crichton tales like "Jurassic Park." This time, it's the author who's the dinosaur. 
"Disclosure" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, sexual references and one sexual episode. DISCLOSURE  Directed by Barry Levinson; written by Paul Attanasio, based on the novel by Michael Crichton; director of photography, Anthony Pierce-Roberts; edited by Stu Linder; music by Ennio Morricone; production designer, Neil Spisak; produced by Mr. Levinson and Mr. Crichton; released by Warner Brothers.  Running time: 128 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽The Thief and the Cobbler‽,‽“The Thief and the Cobbler” is to animated movies what “The Magnificent Ambersons” is to live-action ones: a staggering masterpiece that can never be seen in its ideal form. “Ambersons,” directed by Orson Welles, was completed but then mutilated by its studio, its original version lost; “Cobbler,” a dream project the animator Richard Williams had been working on since the 1960s, was wrested from him by financiers in 1993, incomplete by about 15 minutes.

‽71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance‽,‽Consider the word chance in the title of Michael Haneke’s 1994 feature “71 Fragments of a Chronology  of Chance.” An icy-cool study of violence both mediated and horribly real, the film follows a handful of seemingly unrelated characters all of whom — perhaps by chance, perhaps by divine intervention, though mostly through artistic contrivance — have the grave misfortune to be in an Austrian bank when a 19-year-old student starts randomly if purposefully unloading his revolver.  The film, which was never released in America, opens this week at Anthology Film Archives as part of a retrospective dedicated to Mr. Haneke, one of the great if occasionally more maddening voices in contemporary cinema. 
“71 Fragments” is the final installment in what Mr. Haneke has self-consciously referred to as his “glaciation” trilogy, which began with his first feature, “The Seventh Continent” (1989), and continued with one of his most controversial works, “Benny’s Video” (1992). Briefly put, “71 Fragments” is, like other Haneke films, a moral and philosophical meditation on the banality of evil and our nominal complicity, inside the movie theater and out, in a world in which a television news report on Michael Jackson is squeezed between horrors from Bosnia and Somalia. For Mr. Haneke, the point seems less that evil is commonplace than that we don’t engage with it as thinking, actively moral beings. We slurp our soup while Sarajevo burns on the boob tube. 
In “71 Fragments,” the former Yugoslavia smolders between snippets of jet-black film and scenes from everyday Viennese life. In one home, a woman and man struggle with their newborn; elsewhere, a childless couple struggle with a new foster daughter. An old man visits his daughter, a teller in a bank, only to be coolly rebuffed as if he were just another bothersome customer. A homeless Romanian boy eats garbage, then watches a woman play ball in a park with children and a dog that looks considerably better fed (and loved) than he does. For those who miss the point: a young man mechanically hits Ping-Pong balls spitting out of a machine, again and again, testing his will or maybe his sanity as well as the viewer’s patience. 
Born in Germany and educated in Austria, Mr. Haneke has emerged as an important force in world cinema in the last decade, principally on the strength of powerful provocations like “Code Unknown,” “The Piano Teacher” and “Caché.” These later, rather more accessible films are very much of an intellectual piece with his earlier work, but Mr. Haneke has in recent years mellowed his tone and adapted a more classical approach to narrative, adding French money and stars along the way. (Chance probably has nothing to do with these developments.) He’s still puzzling over the important questions  —  how do we live and why  —  but his outrage no longer feels quite as punitive, perhaps because he has come to realize that his wagging finger is not an arrow but a pendulum.

‽Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern‽,‽In every life there comes a moment of realization that what we assumed would always be there is actually vanishing. Our parents die, the houses we grew up in are sold, neighborhood landmarks disappear and sooner or later what we used to call home just isn't there anymore. 
Jeanne Jordan and Steven Ascher's absorbing documentary film, ''Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern,'' presents itself as a case study of the decline of a small-farming way of life in the American heartland. But the movie, which Ms. Jordan narrates in a deceptively chipper, faintly sardonic style, is really the story of her own coming to terms with the ultimate disappearance of home. 
The film, which won the award for best documentary at last year's Sundance Film Festival, is really an extended home movie starring Ms. Jordan's likable parents, Russel and Mary Jane Jordan, members of a hardy breed of farmers in northwestern Iowa who have worked the land for generations. Ms. Jordan is one of six children of the couple, who, like so many other agricultural families in the 1980's, found themselves getting ever more deeply in debt to increasingly hard-nosed financial institutions. 
After much anguished consultation, the Jordans decided that the most economically feasible solution  was to auction off their farm equipment, animals and other possessions to pay the debt, and give the land to their oldest son, Jim, to work, while they moved into town. That way, the land would remain in the family. 
The film presents the bushy-browed Russel (who was once runner-up in an Abraham Lincoln look-alike contest and who suffers from Parkinson's disease) and Mary Jane as laconic salt-of-the-earth types who face up to their situation with a tight-lipped dignity, although not without tears. Mary Jane, a onetime Iowa state 4-H president, is especially bereft over the sale of her Ethan Allen furniture. 
The Jordans' story, which the narrator humorously dubs ''a midwestern,'' is interspersed with scenes from classic westerns like ''Red River'' and ''High Noon.'' Straining a metaphor, the movie compares the auction of the family's belongings on a snowy winter morning to a climactic Hollywood gunfight. But for all the buildup, not much suspense is generated over the auction price of a combine and a herd of cows. 
In the film's eeriest scene, Ms. Jordan and her parents revisit an earlier family home, now uninhabited, in the once-cozy Iowa community  of Rolfe, which now appears to be a well-kept ghost town. There's the spic-and-span facade of Ms. Jordan's high school, which, she says, was recently closed for lack of enrollment. Everything seems to be snugly in place except for the people, who have gone somewhere else. 
Without becoming analytical, the movie, which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, describes the economic cycles of farm life and offers some rough statistics on the decline of American agriculture. (Since the 1960's, the number of farms has dwindled to fewer than two million, from six million). 
But what gives the film its elegiac resonance has little to do with the farm crisis or with western movie myths. The images of the land, with its windmill and its cattle, and of the Jordan clan figuratively drawing their wagons into a circle in hard times exert a nostalgic tug for a Norman Rockwell dream of which this family, in better days, seemed to have found a piece.

‽Champagne Safari‽,‽A picture may be worth a thousand words, but sometimes no amount of pictures can capture the precise image of a man's soul. 
Take the case of Charles E. Bedaux, the all-but-forgotten millionaire who is the subject of George Ungar's intriguing but undernourished documentary, ''The Champagne Safari,'' which opens today at  Cinema Village. 
Bedaux, a school dropout, immigrated to the United States from France in 1906 at the age of 19 after apprenticing with a pimp in Montmartre. Speaking no English, Bedaux arrived with $1 in his pocket. By the 1920's, he had amassed a fortune as a management consultant, peddling the concept of industrial efficiency to major corporations. 
By the early 30's Bedaux was doing business in 18 countries and was the squire of the Chateau de Cande, a 114-room castle in the Loire Valley that became a playground for heads of state, captains of industry, movie stars and royalty like the Duke of Windsor, whose wedding to Wallis Warfield Simpson took place there. 
But Bedaux's approach to business apparently was unfettered by moral considerations. Labor came to loathe this father of robotic efficiency. His long flirtation with Hitler's Germany and his attempt to realize his grandiose supranational personal visions without heeding the choice between Fascism and democracy demanded by World War II, led to his doom. In 1944, in confinement in Miami and about to be charged with treason against his adopted country, the United States, Bedaux died, apparently a suicide. 
Accompanied by portentous narration and interviews with people familiar with its subject's strange story, Mr. Ungar's film interweaves the biography of Bedaux with clips illustrating the history of his times and with the recently discovered motion picture record of an extravagant expedition that Bedaux undertook in 1934. Called the Bedaux Sub-Arctic Expedition, this doomed foray into the remotest reaches of the Canadian Rockies included not only Bedaux's wife and mistress but five nickel-plated Citroen halftracks, 130 pack horses, 53 cowboys and Floyd Crosby, an Academy Award-winning cinematographer who recorded the expedition. 
For all the pictorial riches that underlie ''The Champagne Safari,'' the film of the expedition coexists uneasily with the images of Bedaux's work and times. Parts of his life, like his first marriage, which produced a son, are left unexplored. The interviews raise speculation that the film maker never pursues, in particular the suspicion that Bedaux was murdered to keep him from testifying about other American industrialists whose hunger for profits led them to  deal with the Nazis. 
There is a mountain in the Canadian Rockies named for Bedaux. It remains, the film says, untouched and forgotten. ''The Champagne Safari'' raises Bedaux briefly into the light but leaves him similarly untouched and soon to be forgotten once more.

‽The Horseman on the Roof‽,‽All it takes for civilization to explode into a frenzied panic is a rampant cholera epidemic. The madness that attends such a plague is a gripping leitmotif that runs through Jean-Paul Rappeneau's gorgeously picturesque film "The Horseman on the Roof" like a cagey rat skittering across a banquet table. In one scene after another of this sumptuous 19th-century costume drama, an idyllic rural tableau worthy of Corot or Millet is shattered when a character suddenly goes pale, collapses to the ground and succumbs to racking spasms that quickly end in death. The victims attract flocks of crows feasting on human carrion. 
These horrifying moments are the ominous minor chords in a love story meticulously adapted from a much-admired 1951 novel by the French author Jean Giono. Its central character, Angelo Pardi (Olivier Martinez), is nothing less than 19th-century heroism incarnate. An idealistic revolutionary and an indomitably fearless soldier of noble character who stifles his passion for a beautiful married woman, he embodies values like honor and gallantry that have faded so completely from contemporary consciousness that the very words have a quaint, musty ring. 
That may be one reason the movie's sword fights, rescues and other feats of  derring-do, while filmed with a quicksilver lightness and fluidity, lack the impact of its scenes of agonizing death. In the era of "The Hot Zone," the image of a crazed mob storming through the streets of a plague-stricken city looking for scapegoats they believe have poisoned the water makes you wonder, what if? The hysteria reaches almost comic proportions when the guests at an elegant dinner party, learning that two latecomers have just come from a quarantined area, scream in terror and frantically scatter while a maid rushes into the dining room strewing disinfectant. 
Against this backdrop of splendor and social havoc, the movie spins the tale  of Angelo and Pauline de Theus (Juliette Binoche), the woman with whom he falls  in love as he accompanies her on horseback across the French countryside. 
It is the 1830's. Although a detailed historical background isn't crucial to  appreciating the movie, it helps to know that Angelo is a member of the Carbonari, the secret society of Italian freedom fighters that flourished in the early 19th century. Angelo has exiled himself to France along with many of his fellow revolutionaries because the Austrian Empire, which wants to crush revolutionary movements throughout Europe, has installed a puppet king in their  homeland. But even in France, the Carbonari are pursued by Austrian spies. In the movie's opening scene, set in Aix-en-Provence during a summer carnival, imperial agents break into the home of a Carbonaro and drag him off as his wife  dashes into the street to find Angelo and warn him to leave town at once. 
Angelo flees to the city of Manosque just as the epidemic strikes and finds himself pursued by a rabid mob. Following a dizzying rooftop chase, he steals into a well-appointed house whose sole inhabitant, Pauline, is remarkably unfazed by his presence and gives him food and shelter. In gratitude for her help, he insists on changing his plans to return to Italy and accompanying her on the journey to her hometown of Theus, where she expects to rejoin her much-older husband. The trip is fraught with danger, and the pair find themselves alternately fighting off and hiding from French soldiers enforcing a  quarantine that has been imposed. 
The story is haunted by two questions. Will the growing attraction between the impeccably chivalrous Angelo and his companion be consummated? And will the  plague they are outrunning catch up with them? Their perilous odyssey is filled  with swashbuckling adventures, sudden changes of plan and heated emotional conflict between the fiercely independent Pauline and Angelo, who is determined  to see her home safely. 
"The Horseman on the Roof," which opens today at the Paris, is wonderful to look at, and its scenes filmed during the summer in the south of France are intoxicatingly sensuous. But for a love story that aspires to Wagnerian heights, the film feels awfully muted. Although Mr. Martinez has the good looks and physical grace of a classic romantic hero, a crucial emotional note is missing from his performance. He is likable but never compellingly incandescent. Ms. Binoche oozes the very luminosity Mr. Martinez lacks. She conveys a mercurially  eruptive spirit that makes Pauline mysterious and utterly captivating. 
The movie aspires to an epic grandeur that is at once sweepingly romantic and contemporary in the lightness of its touch. Although that goal proves elusive, the film will still leave you dazzled with its vision of a beautiful world cleft by disaster. 
"The Horseman on the Roof" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or  adult guardian). It has violence, several scenes of people in death throes and a nude scene.

‽Delta of Venus‽,‽Sex without sweat. Sex without playfulness. Sex without expression, unless you call the sullen come-hither attitude of a Calvin Klein model an expression:  Zalman King's newest soft-core romance is a fashion shoot pretending to be an erotic film. Although the movie, which was adapted from Anais Nin's novel "Delta of Venus," is filled with pretty people shuffled into an array of inviting sexual tableaux, it doesn't have a trace of passion. 
"Delta of Venus" follows the sexual awakening of Elena (Audie England), a young American writer living in Paris in 1939 who dreams of falling in love "in  such a way that even the sight of a man a block a way could make her tremble and melt." Ms. England, an actress with the face of a young Lauren Bacall, recites lines like these in a somnambulistic high-pitched monotone with a peevish "Valley Girl" edge that divests them of any emotion. 
Lawrence (Costas Mandylor), the dream lover who rescues Elena from her malaise, is a successful expatriate American writer about to return to the States for a book tour. With his moistened lips and face full of carefully tended stubble, Mr. Mandylor resembles the early 60's Ringo Starr with a 90's make-over, but when he speaks he is as dull and affectless as Ms. England. 
During their artfully lighted couplings, the pair lock eyes, challenging each other to see which one can hold out the longest without rushing back to the mirror for a quick hair check. 
Once Lawrence departs, Elena is commissioned by an anonymous collector of erotica to write stories describing "a woman's inner desires" for 200 francs a page. In one scenario, a prostitute is sexually hypnotized by a West African clairvoyant with a muscular body and a shaved head. In another, a redheaded fascist with gleaming eyes pushes Elena onto a chain-link fence and rapes her. These scenes have all the spark and spontaneity of a contortionist act. 
Larded through the film, which opens today at Cinema Village, are dollops of  Nin's coy, narcissistic prose. Heated but oddly demure, these excerpts add an extra dimension of fatuity to "Delta of Venus": they make all the faked passion  look quaint. 
"Delta of Venus" is rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It has scenes with sexual content and violence.

‽Nico Icon‽,‽As sad as it is to watch someone endowed with beauty, talent and intelligence go down in flames, there is also something darkly reassuring in the drama of a golden being who willfully self-destructs. That voyeuristic fascination with doomed glamour is one of the guilty pleasures of Susanne Ofteringer's utterly haunting documentary film, "Nico Icon." Examining the unhappy life of Christa Paffgen, the German singer, songwriter, model and occasional actress who reinvented herself as Nico, the film locates the void at the heart of modern demi-celebrity. 
As a performer with the Velvet Underground and as a chiseled blond goddess fiddling with her hair in "The Chelsea Girls," Nico was the most stunningly beautiful and enigmatic of Andy Warhol's 1960's "superstars." In a solo musical  career that never took off commercially, Nico carried Marlene Dietrich's world-weary hauteur to an icy extreme on recordings in which she moaned her sepulchral speech-song in a deep, foggy voice that wove a death-entranced spell. 
During the 1970's, Nico, who died in 1988 at the age of 49, became a heroin  addict. The documentary's most chilling stories, told by James Young, her keyboard player for five years, describe the singer's horrifying knife fights with her manager on a tour bus filled with drug paraphernalia. 
Calling Nico "the queen of the bad girls," Mr. Young insists that the singer  was proud of the fact that "her teeth were rotten, her hair was gray, her skin was bad and she had needle tracks all over." In the film's excerpts from a 1986  interview, Nico, who announces that her only regret in life was having been born a woman instead of a man, looks scary, but still striking. 
As the film follows Nico from her German childhood through a rootless bohemian life in Paris, where she worked as a model, to New York and then back to Europe, a portrait emerges of a woman who seems to have been born disaffected. Her air of nonchalance, far from being a chic pose, reflected a profound spiritual emptiness. Acquaintances recall that Nico didn't like modeling and hated being beautiful. She had few friends and no interests. 
After Nico bore a son, Ari, by the French actor Alain Delon, who refused to acknowledge his paternity, she proved to be a careless mother who fed the child  a diet of potato chips. Mr. Delon's mother took over his care. Many years later, Nico introduced her son to heroin. 
Nico seems always to have been drawn toward death. At the height of her post-Velvet Underground fame, she had an obsessive relationship with Jim Morrison, who at their first meeting involved her in a stoned ritual during which she wondered if he was trying to kill her. Later she called him her "soul  brother" and credited him with encouraging her to write songs. 
The director waits until the end of the film to introduce the grown-up Ari. A disturbed young man who bears a strong resemblance to his father, he is mesmerized by his mother's legend. Once, when he was in a drug-induced coma, he boasts, she visited him in the hospital and asked if she could tape the sound of his life-support machine for a record. 
Enthralling and spooky, "Nico Icon," which opens today at Film Forum, includes many other comparably eerie reminiscences. In the end, its subject emerges as an embodiment of the aimlessness and morbid languor that were the shadow side of the unbridled hedonism of the 60's. 
NICO ICON Written (in English, German and French, with English subtitles) and directed by  Susanne Ofteringer; director of photography, Judith Kaufmann and Katarzyna Remin; edited by Elfe Brandenburger and Guido Krajewski; produced by Annette Pisacane and Thomas Mertens; released by Roxie Releasing.

‽Four Rooms‽,‽Since it's not possible to hide a brand-new movie under a rock, Miramax did the next best thing with "Four Rooms," trying to give it a review-proof opening  on Christmas Day. That amounts to an act of mercy, since the less said about this career-denting fiasco, the better. Preview audiences don't often look as seasick as the crowd filing out of Thursday night's screening. 
Why? Well, "Four Rooms" is a long-awaited omnibus film with segments directed by four talented young film makers who were free to indulge their wildest notions about what might go on in hotel rooms on New Year's Eve. Indulge they did. They piled on time-killing chat, strained attempts at kinkiness and enough  celebrity cameos to give "Four Rooms" the illusion of star power. The cast does  include some good actors. But you wouldn't want to see any of these people in a  traffic accident, and you won't want to see them here. 
The heaviest acting burden falls -- hard -- on Tim Roth, who plays a bellhop named Ted in a spirit of ill-advised homage to Jerry Lewis. Frenetic and broad even by Lewis standards, Mr. Roth's Ted is victimized by hotel guests in each of the four short films. The first, "The Missing Ingredient," finds him playing straight man to a coven of witches led by Madonna in a black rubber mermaid dress. The witches take over the Honeymoon Suite to perform rites dopey enough to give witchcraft an extra-bad name. 
The director is Allison Anders, who showed a keen understanding of female characters in her first-rate "Gas Food Lodging" but who treats the women in this film like idiots. The coven -- Valeria Golino, Lili Taylor, Ione Skye and Sammi  Davis -- gather with Madonna around an improvised caldron and dance half-naked,  looking ridiculous. They are trying to summon the spirit of a blond witch (Amanda de Cadenet) who vanished many years ago while wearing black lingerie and spanking another blonde. Something like that. 
Anyway, the witches have everything they need except a semen specimen, which  is where Ted figures in this equation. Ms. Skye, who was so much better in "Gas  Food Lodging," lands the job of procuring the specimen. Ted desperately overacts being flustered. 
Since "The Missing Ingredient" is so bad and runs first, it can be presumed to be the weakest entry here. But the next film, Alexandre Rockwell's "Wrong Man," is actually worse. This time, a man with a gun (David Proval) menaces a woman (Jennifer Beals, Mr. Rockwell's wife) whom he has gagged and tied to a chair. When she gets the gag off, insults and accusations of infidelity fly. 
Into this domestic spat comes Ted, who is eventually kissed by the man and regaled by the wife with a long, mocking list of synonyms for the word penis. When Ted tries to climb out a window, a man (Lawrence Bender, the film's producer) leans out the window and throws up on him. 
The next film, "The Misbehavers" by Robert Rodriguez, is the best thing here  for several reasons: because it has a sustained comic conceit, because it has Antonio Banderas delivering droll self-parody, and because the rest of "Four Rooms" looks downright unreleasable. In this segment, Mr. Banderas parodies hotblooded machismo as he plays a family man who decides to romance his wife (Tamlyn Tomita) while their two children stay alone in a hotel room. Ted is handed a big tip and told to baby-sit. 
The film spins some pitch-black comedy out of this situation and is helped by a confident performance by Lana McKissack as the older child. She calls Ted to report a steady stream of complaints. Among other things, her kid brother (Danny Verduzco) is smoking, drinking champagne, playing with a gun and watching a steamy dancer on cable television (Salma Hayek, Mr. Rodriguez's current muse, plays this tiny role).  Ted is not helpful, but he is terrified of Mr. Banderas's character, who is sooner or later bound to come home.  Mr. Banderas sends off this segment with the right punch line. 
Finally, along comes "The Man From Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino's first film directing since "Pulp Fiction." It finds Mr. Tarantino doing something not many  other directors would try right now: casting himself in a lead acting role. (He'll also soon appear in Mr. Rodriguez's "From Dusk Till Dawn.") Ensconced in  a penthouse with an odd bunch of cronies -- Bruce Willis, Ms. Beals and Paul Calderon -- Mr. Tarantino plays a guy who has been made jaded and frivolous by overnight success as a film maker. Coming from him, this is no laughing matter. 
Ted is recruited to settle a bet taken from an old "Twilight Zone" episode. If Mr. Calderon wins, he gets a car; if he loses, somebody will chop off his finger. Can the group tip Ted enough to make him do the hatchet job? Most of the film is about settling this nasty business. Along the way, Mr. Tarantino throws  in details that lamely recall "Pulp Fiction" without a trace of its cleverness.  There are empty discussions of beverages, brand names and pop culture. A phone call to a different location finds Marisa Tomei stoned and dazed before a video  game, picking up where Eric Stoltz, the drug dealer in "Pulp Fiction," left off. Andrzej Sekula's cinematography gives this segment a harsher, more glaring look  than some of the film's darker-looking episodes, which are set in hotel rooms painted the color of dried blood. 
The camera lingers on some slapstick from Ted as the final credits roll. Last week's preview audience refused to stay for this and set a speed record racing for the exit doors.

‽
‽Waiting to Exhale‽,‽Everyone has heard that Mr. Right is dead. The novelist Rona Jaffe announced  his demise 30 years ago in one of her catchier book titles, and since then the women's movement has driven several boxes of nails into his coffin. 
But is he really done for? Despite themselves, the four black women whose turbulent love lives are explored with a salty good humor in "Waiting to Exhale" all subscribe to the myth of a knight in shining armor. By the end of the film, adapted by Terry McMillan (with Ronald Bass) from her best-selling novel, one of the four actually finds her Prince Charming, and another has established a long-distance correspondence with someone who shows distinct Mr. Right potential. 
But these princely paragons are shining exceptions. Most of the boyfriends who parade through the lives of Savannah (Whitney Houston), Bernadine (Angela Bassett), Gloria (Loretta Devine) and Robin (Lela Rochon) are buffoons or cads or both. The women respond to their egotism, double-dealing and hilariously depicted sexual ineptitude with varying degrees of tolerance and amusement, until they run out of patience. Then, in time-honored soap opera fashion, they tell off the men who have mistreated them in speeches that have a flouncy dramatic flourish. 
Although "Waiting to Exhale" aspires to be more than a glossy soap opera, beneath its feistiness it is awash in romantic fantasy. Contributing to the heady atmosphere is a luscious soundtrack of pop ballads, most of them written and produced by Kenneth Edmonds, more commonly known as Babyface, and featuring  Ms. Houston, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Toni Braxton and half a dozen other pop divas, all singing near the top of their form. Although the songs slip unobtrusively in and out of the background, they function as a subliminal Greek  chorus that lends the movie a pink romantic glow. That glow matches the story's  Phoenix setting, a posh suburban paradise of rosy sunsets and large, immaculate  living rooms. 
Of the four main characters, Bernadine has by far the most drama in her life. And Ms. Bassett lends a raging, spitfire fury to the role of a wife whose rich smoothie of a husband dumps her for a white woman and then tries to cheat her out of a decent divorce settlement. No sooner has he walked out on her than she  empties a closet full of his fancy clothes into the back of a car, douses the pile with gasoline and sets it on fire. Ms. Bassett's fuming performance is the  movie's riskiest and most compelling, and gives the movie its dramatic backbone. 
Her friends' problems aren't as dire and could all be boiled down to a question of looking for Mr. Right. Savannah keeps falling for dreamboats with feet of clay. Her situation isn't helped by a bossy mother who keeps advising her to be patient and wait for her smug married lover to divorce his wife. Gloria, a hairdresser recently separated from her bisexual husband, is raising a teen-age son. Possible romance appears in the form of Marvin (Gregory Hines), her new next-door neighbor. Boy-crazy Robin suffers through a succession of sleazy lovers just for the sake of having someone. 
"Waiting to Exhale" is the first feature film directed by Forest Whitaker, a  fine actor who elicits flashy, full-bodied performances from his four leading ladies. Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a  pop star in "The Bodyguard" seem so distant. Ms. Devine gives her character, a woman of some girth, a sexy comic swivel, and Ms. Rochon exudes a smoldering heat. 
But as storytelling, the movie is little more than a collection of vignettes  strung around candy-sweet soundtrack. Like the score, whose high point is Aretha Franklin wailing her heart out in a Babyface ballad, "It Hurts Like Hell," "Waiting to Exhale" is a series of star turns by four appealing divas conjuring  glamorous dramatic fireworks for a director who clearly loves them. 
"Waiting to Exhale" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations and strong language. 
WAITING TO EXHALE Directed by Forest Whitaker; written by Terry McMillan and Ronald Bass, based on the novel by Ms. McMillan; director of photography, Toyomichi Kurita; edited by  Richard Chew; music by Babyface (Kenneth Edmonds); production designer, David Gropman; produced by Ezra Swerdlow and Deborah Schindler; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽
‽Sudden Death‽,‽Jean-Claude Van Damme is an actor best seen and not heard. And in "Sudden Death," his chilly new action-adventure film, he is so busy dashing around that  he barely has time to talk. The number of speeches he garbles in his heavily accented monotone can be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
This verbal blankness is part of his appeal. As Mr. Van Damme (and his stunt  doubles) execute the movie's many acrobatic feats, he comes as close as any actor can to resembling a flesh-and-blood comic-book hero who is all action and  no feeling (hugs with his character's children notwithstanding). In "Sudden Death," his derring-do prevents 17,000 hockey fans, among them the Vice President of the United States, from being blown to smithereens at the Stanley Cup finals in Pittsburgh's Civic Arena. During a chase sequence, he even hides from his pursuers by donning a uniform and impersonating the Pittsburgh Penguins' ailing goalie, with surprising skill. 
The movie, directed by Peter Hyams, who worked with the star in "Timecop," is one long countdown to barely averted disaster. Portraying Darren McCord, the  arena's intrepid fire marshal, Mr. Van Damme foils a sophisticated plot to hold  the Vice President hostage and force him to arrange the transfer of more than $1 billion in frozen Government assets into the criminals' bank accounts. If that isn't accomplished by the end of the game, promises the gang's ringleader, Foss  (Powers Boothe), chaos will erupt. A little extra time is bought when the match  between the Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks goes into sudden-death overtime. 
At different points in the film, McCord's two children, Tyler (Ross Malinger) and Emily (Whittni Wright), become the villains' pawns. The unctuously suave Foss isn't just greedy, he's sadistic. "Would you like it if I filled your mouth up with spiders?" he asks the little girl after she's become his hostage. Later, he offers her a glass of wine and a cigarette. "It's customary to offer these minor vices to people before they die," he taunts. 
For action-adventure fans, "Sudden Death" offers above-average pyrotechnics,  a body count that steadily mounts, and plenty of hand-to-hand combat. The most ingeniously grisly scene occurs in a kitchen where McCord improvises some new and deadly functions for professional cooking equipment. 
"Sudden Death" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has almost continuous violence, moderate gore and strong language. 
SUDDEN DEATH Directed by Peter Hyams; written by Gene Quintano, based on a story by Karen Baldwin; director of photography, Mr. Hyams; edited by Steven Kemper; music by John Debney; production designer, Philip Harrison; produced by Moshe Diamant and Howard Baldwin; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 110 minutes. This  film is rated R.

‽
‽Grumpier Old Men‽,‽There's something comforting about watching the Odd Couple turn into the Old  Couple. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau may no longer be sharing living quarters, but in the 1993 movie "Grumpy Old Men" and its zanier sequel, which opens today, these cantankerous next-door neighbors in Wabasha, Minn., know exactly how to drive each other crazy. And they have all the time and energy in the world to do it. 
If John Gustafson (Mr. Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Mr. Matthau) are thin-skinned grouches in their sagging flesh, their success with women is nothing short of fantastic. Have any two older men of modest means been luckier in love? 
The original movie dropped Ann-Margret, playing a purring earth-motherly sculptor, into John's lap, and she is back in the sequel as his perfect wife, whose favorite artistic subject is her husband's baggy nude body. "Grumpier Old  Men," which begins six months after the last movie ends, more than evens the score between the neighborly rivals by presenting Max with a compliant Sophia Loren, jiggling her cleavage in a bright red dress. 
The 61-year-old star, who looks sensational, plays Maria Ragetti, a much-married-and-divorced proprietor of an Italian restaurant that has sprung up on the site of John and Max's beloved bait shop. 
Furious about the demise of the store, the two friends, both avid fishermen,  wage a campaign to shut the place down. In their most outrageous prank, they send a guinea pig that is supposed to look like a rat into the restaurant while  a health inspector is present. Maria retaliates by bathing the conspirators in pasta sauce. 
Amid all the hostility, Maria and Max somehow develop a mutual crush. The furthest thing from a polished ladies' man, Max walks around rehearsing sweet talk in which he declares that out of all the fish in the sea, she's the one he  would like to mount over his fireplace. 
On their first official date, he leads her around with a flashlight looking for worms. Hoping to wow her with his culinary skills, he cooks up a love feast  consisting of an ominous brown "mystery stew" and stacks of peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. 
Relations between Max and John deteriorate when their children, Jacob (Kevin  Pollak) and Melanie (Daryl Hannah), abruptly call off their wedding. In the movie's funniest scenes, the two men briefly become the bitterest enemies, dispatching their pets on missions of destruction. Max's secret weapon is a vicious one-eyed dog that subsists on chili and becomes flatulent at the most inopportune moments. 
Held over from the earlier film along with Mr. Lemmon, Mr. Matthau, Ann-Margret, Mr. Pollak and Ms. Hannah is Burgess Meredith as Grandpa Gustafson, John's sexually avid 95-year-old father. Grandpa has a fling with Maria's sourpuss mother (Ann Guilbert) and puts a smile on her face. In a screenplay packed with sexual double-entendres, Mr. Meredith is given the smuttiest lines. 
"Grumpier Old Man," which was directed by Howard Deutch from a screenplay by  Mark Steven Johnson, who also wrote the first film, doesn't even try to make sense. And for all the vaunted grumpiness, nobody stays mad for long. In the tradition of "Moonstruck" (this film shamelessly borrows Dean Martin's "That's Amore" from "Moonstruck" and uses it to similar effect), it is a screwball sitcom that takes a relentlessly cheery view of human behavior. And its vision of old age is giddily reassuring. 
Grounding the zaniness is the chemistry between its two likable stars. Beneath their crusty eccentricities, Max and John are teen-agers at heart, a Wayne and Garth for the "Modern Maturity" set. As Max, his leathery face beaming with pleasure, might put it: "Holy moley, is this a dumb movie!" But it is also  fun. 
"Grumpier Old Men" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The screenplay includes many sexual double-entendres and references to flatulence. 
GRUMPIER OLD MEN Directed by Howard Deutch; written by Mark Steven Johnson; director of photography, Tak Fujimoto; edited by Billy Weber, Seth Flaum and Maryann Brandon; music by Alan Silvestri; production designer, Gary Frutkoff; produced by John Davis and Richard C. Berman; released by Warner Brothers. Running time:  105 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

‽
‽Dracula: Dead and Loving It‽,‽The title "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is so perfect that it's almost a good-will ambassador for Mel Brooks's slight but amusing new parody. Mr. Brooks  may no longer be at the forefront of silly comedy, but he's still laying on the  genre gags, horrible puns and enema references with dependable good cheer. So even if this "Dracula" is thin-blooded, its better moments redeem a lot of dead  air. It's hard to resist a vampire film in which someone says: "Yes, we have Nosferatu. We have Nosferatu today." 
Mr. Brooks has recruited the ever-sporting Leslie Nielsen to play a charmingly dim Dracula and give this film the feeling of an undead "Naked Gun."  Mr. Nielsen proves equally good at capturing the Count's hauteur and at falling  down a flight of stairs after slipping on bat droppings. The film, which follows the broad outlines of the familiar Dracula story, also gives its main character  an alter ego in the form of his own shadow. While the real Dracula tangos debonairly on the dance floor, his shadow has raunchier things in mind. 
Also on hand, and zanily good, is Peter MacNicol as Renfield, the lawyer who arrives in Transylvania to become Dracula's slave. Renfield's funniest scene should play well with children, since it has him joining Dr. Seward (Harvey Korman) for tea in the garden and sneakily trying to eat every insect in sight.  Mr. Korman, an old hand at this sort of anything-goes humor, plays the doctor's  stuffy English mannerisms to the hilt and sputters "Poppycock!" with all the proper indignation. Anne Bancroft makes a brief, uncredited appearance as a very strange Gypsy. 
Mr. Brooks also has fun with an accent since he casts himself as the very Teutonic Dr. Van Helsing, who says "attekt" for "attacked" and loves making his medical students keel over in autopsy class. Mr. Brooks and Mr. Nielsen are  clearly on the same wavelength, which makes this Van Helsing just fine as Dracula's nemesis. When the job of driving a stake through a vampire's heart gets messy, Van Helsing looks at the floor and observes, "We should have put newspapers down." 
Mr. Brooks also tries to keep "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" reasonably lively by calling much attention to the beautiful babes who captivate the Count once he arrives in London and becomes a man about town. Amy Yasbeck gives Mina Seward the right comic loftiness. And as Lucy, Lysette Anthony is slyly funny and so alluring that she causes Dracula to turn into a bat and fly right into her bedroom window. Unfortunately, the window is closed at the time. 
"Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual suggestiveness and double-entendres to make children giggle, and a slight amount of spurting-artery type gore. 
DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT Produced and directed by Mel Brooks; written by Mr. Brooks, Rudy De Luca and Steve Haberman, from a story by Mr. De Luca and Mr. Haberman, based on characters created by Bram Stoker; director of photography, Michael D.

‽
‽Cutthroat Island‽,‽IT'S cutthroat time at the movies, all right, when the last two weeks of the  year bring a stampede of bloated entertainments no one necessarily wants to see. Suicidal case in point: "Cutthroat Island," this winter's "Waterworld," which stars Thailand, Malta, two cannon-firing pirate ships, one monkey (maybe all the parrots were busy) and Geena Davis as a pirate queen. It's not possible to believe that Ms. Davis is the highly respected captain of a pirate ship, and it's not even fun to try. More interesting is the question of who had enough doubloons loose to think "Cutthroat Island" belonged in America's Christmas stocking. 
The director is Renny Harlin, who has said in supposed jest: "My motto is: If you build it, you either have to burn it down or blow it up. Otherwise, it's a waste of money." But in today's Hollywood those are often words to live by, and  Mr. Harlin ("Cliffhanger," "Die Harder") does have real talent for demolition. He may have found it a creative challenge to pile on explosions, vertiginous special effects and theme-park-worthy atmospheric touches (like a crab crawling  on a dead body covered with cobwebs). 
But along the way, something got lost: an idea of what this film's audience  might be. So "Cutthroat Island" proves too stupidly smutty for children, too cartoonish for sane adults and not racy enough for anyone who regards Ms. Davis  in a tight-laced bodice as its main attraction. The only serious incentive for seeing this spectacle is a fascination with extravagance, since "Cutthroat Island" is indeed scenic, hectic and big. Its excesses (just sit through the numbing list of closing credits) prompt nostalgia for the good old days when sensationalism was cheap. 
Mr. Harlin, who is married to Ms. Davis, has the slam-bang directorial gusto  to hold his viewers' attention whenever the actors don't happen to be talking. Unfortunately, that's not much of the time. The film has a busy plot, and the services of two screenwriters and four story writers yield the following: hidden treasure, a clue in Latin to its whereabouts and a handsome Latin-reading rogue  (Matthew Modine) to help either steal or find it. 
There are also plenty of lines like "Riflemen, prepare!" for intrepid Morgan  Adams (Ms. Davis), who duels and head-butts like a man but is otherwise very much the vixen. When not showing off high-booted, gun- and sword-toting bravado, she's offering visual evidence that the garter belt and Wonderbra date to the 17th century. 
In terms of plot, "Cutthroat Island" also cooks up an episode in which Morgan must impersonate a prostitute (a standard pirate tactic?) and another in which she disguises herself as a grand lady to visit a picturesque Jamaican town. When a wanted poster depicting an outlaw with collagen-stung lips ruins Morgan's masquerade, she must swing into action and wreck the town on a runaway carriage  ride. 
The film also dwells on the scenery-chewing evil of Morgan's uncle, Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), who wants to beat her to the treasure. Sadly, the credits fail to indicate who made up Dawg's name and who let Morgan exclaim "Bad Dawg!" at a crucial moment. 
All this might appeal to the adult audience's inner child if it weren't so coarse and mirthlessly silly. Not to mention grisly: the plot device that has Morgan slicing off the tattooed scalp of her dead father, Black Harry (Harris Yulin), and using it as a treasure map robs the film of considerable innocence.  "Holy Virgin! Harry's blessed head!" somebody exclaims when Morgan waves this artifact, which is bloodstained and hairy and really no fun to see. Somebody behind "Cutthroat Island" clearly thought it an amusing touch. 
The action sequences are often strong, with the high energy level Mr. Harlin  brought to "Cliffhanger." But that film looks like a model of austerity next to  this. This film's big moments are pumped up with torrential rains, gunpowder blasts, dizzying altitudes and a score so obnoxiously exultant it suggests the composer ought to walk the plank. The Thai scenery is beautiful (and vividly captured by Peter Levy's cinematography), but it inspires both awe and horror. Awe for the lush green mountains and turquoise seas, horror because two whole pirate ships (subtly named "Morning Star" and "Reaper") had to be built both there and in Malta. And because Mr. Harlin's idea of shooting scenes in a vast Maltese water tank instead of on open seas actually makes this a more level-headed production than "Waterworld." 
Among those hanging from the yardarms here, figuratively speaking, are Patrick Malahide as one of those prim, arch-British action-picture villains. (His could be called the Alan Rickman role, but Mr. Rickman himself, now in "Sense and Sensibility," has moved on to better things.) As a 17th-century writer who has hooked up with pirates for research purposes, Maury Chaykin can lay claim to the film's craziest role. 
As for the leads, Ms. Davis and Mr. Modine photograph well and are game for stunt work, which is all the material requires. (Mr. Modine is more impish and less lusty than his character is supposed to be, perhaps better suited to "Peter Pan.") The stars' biggest acting challenge is a scene that asks them to beam ecstatically at the sight of pirate treasure. They try hard, but their smiles look strained and the gold looks tacky. Besides, that cache is nothing compared  with the loot that's been buried here. 
"Cutthroat Island" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes considerable nasty violence, fleeting sexual situations and much sexual kidding around on the har-har level. 
CUTTHROAT ISLAND Directed by Renny Harlin; written by Robert King and Marc Norman, based on a story by Michael Frost Beckner, James Gorman, Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon; director of photography, Peter Levy; edited by Frank J. Urioste and Ralph E.

‽
‽Balto‽,‽The title character of "Balto," an engaging animated adventure story whose refreshing lack of pretension sets it apart from most feature-length cartoons, is an Alaskan canine who is rejected by his peers for being half dog and half wolf. Canine life in Nome, where the movie is set, revolves around dog-sled races that have the fervor of high-school football games. The local hero and top dog is an unscrupulous, predatory ladies' man named Steele (the voice of Jim Cummings), whose swaggering ways set female hearts aflutter. Steele and his cronies take delight in humiliating poor Balto (Kevin Bacon), who has a serious  crush on a sleek rust-colored huskie named Jenna (Bridget Fonda). 
"Balto," the newest cartoon from Amblin Entertainment, runs only 74 minutes,  but it succeeds in packing them with more than enough of wholesome wintertime adventure. At the same time, the film, directed by Simon Wells, skillfully adapts a true story into an easy-to-swallow anthropomorphic fable about courage, honesty and peer pressure, in which the schoolyard bully gets his comeuppance. 
The historical event to which the movie alludes is a diphtheria outbreak in  Nome in the winter of 1925. The epidemic was quelled when a dog-sled team traveled 600 miles to bring an antitoxin from Nenana. The rescue operation is commemorated by a canine statue in Central Park in Manhattan. In the movie's live-action opening scene, a grandmother whose life was saved by the timely arrival of the medicine visits the statue with her granddaughter and tells the story. 
In their fanciful interpretation of the incident, the four screenwriters imagine that a rescue mission led by Steele gets lost and that Balto, who was rejected from their team, sets out to find them. Joining him are his best friend, a wisecracking Russian snow goose named Boris (Bob Hoskins) and twin polar bears, Muk and Luk (Phil Collins). The obstacles they encounter include a  ferocious black bear, cracking ice, an avalanche and near-catastrophes on several precipices. 
The fable has its mystical moments. The aurora borealis appears on the horizon to show Balto the way home. And at the moment when his energy is about to fail, a white wolf appears at his side to inspire him with lupine fortitude. 
Avoiding the mythological grandiosity and freneticism that afflict so many animated features these days, "Balto" makes modesty a virtue. 
BALTO Directed by Simon Wells; written by Cliff Ruby, Elana Lesser, David Steven Cohen and Roger S. H. Schulman, based on a story by Mr. Ruby and Ms. Lesser; edited by Nick Fletcher and Sim Evan-Jones; music by James Horner; production designer, Hans Bacher; produced by Steve Hickner; released by Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment. Running time: 74 minutes. This film is rated G. 
WITH THE VOICES OF: Kevin Bacon (Balto), Bob Hoskins (Boris), Bridget Fonda (Jenna), Jim Cummings (Steele) and Phil Collins (Muk and Luk). 
‽
‽Tom and Huck‽,‽Aw, shucks! Was there ever a cuter, more adorable Tom Sawyer than Jonathan Taylor Thomas's glossy portrayal in the latest Disney movie, "Tom and Huck"? With his post-Beatles haircut and proto-grunge duds, Mr. Thomas's Tom is the very model of an MTV-wise youngster transported back to Hannibal, Mo., in the 1840's. 
Mr. Thomas doesn't simply mug, roll his eyes and strike magazine-ready poses  with the bravado of a child star who has studied his best camera angles. He flirts shamelessly with the camera and with everyone in sight, lowering his gaze, casting sidelong glances and flashing coy, enigmatic smiles. When he gives his sweetheart, spunky Becky Thatcher (Rachael Leigh Cook), her first kiss, the  camera muscles in for a close-up. A moment later, when he tells her she is "not  the first" girl he has had a crush on, she smacks him. He responds with the sly, sheepish what-did-I-do expression of a baby Clark Gable. 
Brad Renfro's mumbling, sour-faced Huck Finn is no match for Mr. Thomas's winkingly obsequious Tom, and their friendship has little resonance. The character is so underwritten in Stephen Sommers and David Loughery's screenplay  that Huck is barely defined. 
In the story, loosely adapted from Mark Twain's novel, Tom and Huck witness a midnight murder in a graveyard and swear an oath of secrecy. After the wrong man is accused and sent to trial, Tom breaks their vow and names the real culprit, Injun Joe (Eric Schweig), a knife-wielding varmint who flees the courtroom vowing revenge. Tom, Huck, Becky and Injun Joe end up chasing one another in an  echoing cave with a pit so deep it seems to extend into the center of the earth. Guess who ends up taking a dive. And guess who ends up with the buried treasure that started all the fuss. 
Early in the film, Tom cons the neighborhood boys into whitewashing his Aunt  Polly's picket fence. Whitewashing is as good a metaphor as any for a film in which there is not a black face to be seen. Directed by Peter Hewitt, "Tom and Huck" is Mark Twain by way of "The Waltons." 
"Tom and Huck" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some mild violence.

‽
‽Jumanji‽,‽In "Jumanji," a movie based on a book about a board game, the players are endangered by evil monkeys, giant insects, rampaging jungle beasts and vines that shoot poison darts. Children excited by the prospect of such perils would be well advised to get out the Candyland and forget about this. 
But "Jumanji" isn't easily overlooked, as it has Robin Williams and runaway special effects to recommend it. Mr. Williams, giving one of his kindly performances rather than a funny one, plays a lad who has been held prisoner by  the Jumanji game for 26 years. This lost boy returns to his hometown as a middle-aged man covered with scraggly hair, which may be the film's scariest effect of all. 
Actually, there's plenty of competition for that honor, thanks to visual tricks that are allowed to overwhelm the movie. They are linked to verse spouted by the board game, which is the only rhyme or reason to be found here. (Sample couplet, about killer vines, with a debt to "Little Shop of Horrors": "They grow much faster than bamboo/Take care or they'll come after you.") The director, Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "The Rocketeer"), has a background as a visual-effects art director, and saves his greatest enthusiasm for unleashing mayhem. One of the film's biggest, least appetizing sequences involves the frenetic wrecking of a discount store. 
"Jumanji" is based on Chris Van Allsburg's illustrated book about children who summon jungle animals while playing a board game. This book, handsomely illustrated but shadowy and sinister, has only the most slender of stories, so the film essentially starts from scratch. It invents Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd of "Little Man Tate"), who begins playing Jumanji in 1969 in a New Hampshire town. A bad roll of the dice sends bats fluttering out of Alan's fireplace and lands him in limbo. By the time he returns as Mr. Williams, the town has changed drastically for the worse and Alan's parents have died. 
The book's two characters, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), have been turned into orphans living in Alan's former home. Together, they resume the Jumanji game in hopes of freeing Alan and paving the way for an "It's a Wonderful Life"-style dramatic twist, which arrives too late in the story to warm enough hearts. The more relevant movie references are to "The Wizard of Oz," as Judy has Dorothy's pigtails and some of this film's ghastlier creatures  resemble Oz's winged monkeys. If that's not unpleasant enough, Peter also grows  a monkey's snout and tail during one of the film's more bizarre episodes. 
It doesn't help that all the special effects in "Jumanji" look comparably uninviting, from the floorboards that trap Mr. Williams's face to the fake-looking wildlife stampeding through the town. Eschewing warm, cuddly imagery just as Mr. Van Allsburg's book does, the film affects a strange, artificial style that has the invasive weirdness of "Gremlins" but none of the charm. 
What's most alarming about "Jumanji" is its certainty that audiences will settle for a mixture of random gimmicks and easy sentimentality. With those assets in place and perhaps a tie-in board game to market, the film abandons all other prospects of coherence. At least Mr. Williams provides a reassuring presence, with solid help from Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier in the supporting cast. Ms. Dunst, as Judy, once again proves herself a spirited and cunning young actress who can survive floods, bugs and other perfectly meaningless perils with ease. 
"Jumanji" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes many menacing special effects that are liable to upset young children.

‽
‽Heat‽,‽Al Pacino makes an unusual, not to say traffic-stopping entrance in Michael Mann's "Heat," in which he plays a police detective in the grip of strong passions. Mr. Pacino is first seen in bed, making heartfelt love to a woman the  viewer can't quite see. The sight of his face conveys intensity, naked emotion,  and something even more interesting: Mr. Mann's rare ability to reel in his audience with ingenious visual hooks. "Heat" offers nearly three hours' worth of such carefully offbeat glimpses, sights that explode ordinary expectations and do for visual imagery what the sound bite does for words. 
But three hours is a long time. It's long enough to shape a "Godfather"-caliber crime story, or long enough for an overly polished veneer to wear thin. And as "Heat" progresses, its sensational looks pale beside storytelling weaknesses that expose the more soulless aspects of this cat-and-mouse crime tale. Extraordinary actors, clever settings, a maze of a plot and a screenplay with nearly 70 speaking roles don't change the fact that "Heat" is fundamentally hollow and its characters haven't much to say. 
Or that their conflicts are so familiar, once a wealth of handsome window dressing is stripped away. Vincent Hanna (Mr. Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert  De Niro) are a cop and an outlaw locked in the classic dance, both obsessed with what they know will be a fight to the death. This could be a western, or it could be "Les Miserables," or it could be (and is) about high-tech gangsters who live in beach houses and covet bearer bonds. Whatever the milieu, the dynamics of this struggle are predictable, and Mr. Mann does little to improve upon them  with an overdose of moody romance. 
As that first shot of Mr. Pacino anticipates, each of the tough guys in this  story is seriously distracted by the woman in his life. Thus "Heat" creates a hugely complicated web of relationships, though they only occasionally create the illusion of depth. The film's habit of editing together various wife and girlfriend scenes serves less to underscore a prevailing theme than to show up the perfunctoriness of half the story. 
McCauley, for instance, is the ex-con and quintessential loner who orchestrates an elaborate heist at the beginning of the film. But then he meets  a woman in a bookstore. Eady (Amy Brenneman) comes from Appalachia, works as a graphic artist and thinks there's nothing about a man's buying a volume on "Stress Fractures in Titanium" that indicates a dangerous line of work. Eventually, McCauley thaws out enough to hope Eady can help him escape the world of crime and start a new life. Although Mr. De Niro otherwise gives a terrific,  tightly-coiled performance, he plays love scenes with Eady as if he'd rather be  robbing a bank. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Pacino's Vincent struggles to save his marriage to Justine (Diane Venora), whose bohemian beauty is as startling as her dialogue is awful.  For his part, poor Vincent must say things like: "I told you when we hooked up,  baby, that you were gonna have to share me with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet." And this: "I gotta hold on to my angst. I preserve  it because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge, where I gotta be." 
As in his "Last of the Mohicans," Mr. Mann (who wrote this screenplay) often  turns dialogue into nothing more than a necessary evil. The main event here is the show of visual pyrotechnics, demonstrated dazzlingly during several superbly choreographed crime scenes. The most breathtaking of these begins in a bank and  spills out onto the streets of Los Angeles, with gunfire erupting in a public plaza and the action tautly staged from start to finish. No amount of weak dialogue or transparent posturing makes a dent in sequence like this. 
The film's most highly charged confrontation is the one that occurs without shooting: a "High Noon" of the acting world, staged in a coffee shop between the two titans who are this film's stars. It's their only real duel, since their other scene -- a chase on a runway beneath landing planes -- can't be said to pose much of an acting challenge. And the coffee shop scene can't fail to generate sparks, not even when Mr. Pacino says he and McCauley have met "like a  couple of regular fellas." "Heat" doesn't otherwise have a sense of humor, but that's a nice joke. 
Mr. De Niro's wary restraint suits the film's cool, sleek style much better than Mr. Pacino's louder, more flashily demonstrative manner. (Mr. Pacino sometimes booms and exclaims as if worried the rear balcony seats won't hear him.) But both these icons, buffed and costumed and tonsorially empowered to look their best, become as fashionably right for Mr. Mann's tastes as Daniel Day-Lewis was in "The Last of the Mohicans" (or Don Johnson was in "Miami Vice"). Mr. De Niro, as the mastermind of a complex criminal operation, has a more active role here than he does presiding over "Casino," another three-hour epic with a more honestly volatile, less pretentious view of crime. 
The huge, well-chosen cast for "Heat" attests to Mr. Mann's eye for both esthetic interest and acting talent. Even small roles are so well emphasized that they show these performers off to fine advantage. Val Kilmer and Jon Voight don't have enough to do as part of McCauley's gang, but they help set the hard-boiled tone of the film's heist plot, as do striking character actors like  Tom Noonan and Tom Sizemore. On the police side, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine  and Wes Studi back up Vincent Hanna with suitable grit. And on the home front, Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman are photogenic performers delivering by-the-numbers domestic strife. 
Another very big star here is the city of Los Angeles, exquisitely rendered as a place of hard, beautiful surfaces, icy perils and velvet nights. There's nothing new about that conception, but Mr. Mann, his editors (Dov Hoenig and Pasquale Buba) and his cinematographer (Dante Spinotti) give this film's precise backdrops all the excitement that its title implies. 
"Heat" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It includes startling violence, considerable profanity and sexual situations.

‽
‽Cry, the Beloved Country‽,‽The first major film to be made in the newly democratic South Africa, "Cry, the Beloved Country" carries a heavy sense of its own historic weight. Proclaimed "a monument to the future" by no less a figure than Nelson Mandela, the movie, directed by Darrell James Roodt, is an exercise in solemn uplift that is touching despite an atmosphere that at moments becomes stiflingly reverential. 
In adapting Alan Paton's classic 1948 novel for the screen, Mr. Roodt, the young South African film maker who directed "Sarafina!," and his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have remained faithful to the hushed, semi-biblical tone of the  book, while using the cinematography and music to add a romantic gloss. 
As the camera drinks in the panoramic South African landscape of mist-shrouded mountains, the music by John Barry, who also scored "Out of Africa," swells with the same loftiness that infused the earlier film with a whiff of nobility. And the mingling of Mr. Barry's European-style music with fragments of Zulu hymns underscores the movie's dream of racial harmony. 
But while the film, which is set in 1946, has glimpses of South African culture that suggest the mounting racial strife on the eve of apartheid, it is essentially an interior drama. The story traces the fearful odyssey of the Rev.  Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), a Zulu Anglican priest, from his countryside  home to Johannesburg. 
Once in the city, he discovers that his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente), with whom he had fallen out of touch, is a prostitute, and that his brother John (Charles S. Dutton) a political agitator, has lost his religious faith. Worse news follows. With the help of Msimangu (Vusi Kunene), a fellow priest, he tracks down his missing son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who has just killed a man in  a botched robbery attempt. 
The victim, Arthur Jarvis, was a white man who had dedicated his life to helping South African blacks. Arthur was the son of James Jarvis (Richard Harris), a wealthy farmer and white supremacist who lives in the country near Kumalo. Reuniting with Absalom, Kumalo discovers that his son is not a coldblooded criminal but a lost, frightened man who acted out of fear. The young man is nevertheless tried for murder and sentenced to die. From their shared tragedy, the fathers of the killer and his victim eventually forge a deep and healing bond. 
The screenplay, which uses a sparse voiceover narration by Mr. Jones, sticks  so closely to the book that key passages of dialogue are kept entirely intact. And Mr. Jones and Mr. Harris deliver Paton's oratory with a subdued fervor that  makes each word count. When Mr. Harris reads a posthumously discovered manuscript in which his son indicts white South Africa for its inhumanity to blacks, the words have the ring of an excoriating sermon. 
The two central performances in the film, which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, are strikingly different in style. Mr. Jones's Kumalo is a sad, plodding bulldog of a man rumbling with suppressed thunder as he internalizes the onslaught of bad news, the weight of Job bowing his shoulders. Mr. Harris's  Jarvis, alarmingly gaunt with yellowish white hair, trembling lips and an eagle's glare, is flamboyantly volatile, more so than in the book. Beneath the haughty aristocratic facade lies a spoiled, hot-tempered crybaby. 
The film's turning point comes when Kumalo visits Jarvis and tremblingly reveals himself as the father of the younger Jarvis's killer. As the minister shakes with tears, Jarvis whirls on his heels, stricken, absorbing the shock, then swallowing his fury in a remarkable transformation. In a moment as transcendent as it is risky, the screen erupts with a volcanic emotion that cuts through the prevailing high-minded contemplation. 
Why risky? Because movies have become so invested in the unleashing of violent emotion and the escalation of hostility, that expressions of restraint,  reconciliation and forgiveness can easily be read as corny cop-outs. "Cry, the Beloved Country" is not corny, and it doesn't cop out. 
"Cry, the Beloved Country" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a scene in a brothel and some mild violence. 
CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY Directed by Darrell James Roodt; written by Ronald Harwood, adapted from the novel by Alan Paton; director of photography, Paul Gilpin; edited by David Heitner; music by John Barry; production designer, David Barkham; produced by Anant Singh; released by Miramax Films.

‽
‽Leaving Las Vegas‽,‽Ben Sanderson, played devastatingly by Nicolas Cage in "Leaving Las Vegas," is something other than the usual movie drunk. Nothing about him offers golden opportunities to the good Samaritan. Already in the terminal stages of alcoholism as the film begins, Ben seems to sense his fate and want to face it in his own way, with crazy bravado and a whiff of desperate romance. This small, searing film watches transfixingly as Ben plays out his final hand. 
As directed by Mike Figgis, who makes a long overdue return to the sultry intensity of his "Internal Affairs" and "Stormy Monday," "Leaving Las Vegas" has the daring to suspend judgment about Ben's downward spiral. This film simply works as a character study, pitilessly well observed and intimately familiar with its terrain. Mr. Figgis based his screenplay on a novel by John O'Brien, who committed suicide two weeks after learning that his book would be made into a movie. Mr. O'Brien's father describes the novel as his son's suicide note, which does not seem a farfetched claim. 
But "Leaving Las Vegas" is far less dolorous than might be expected. Passionate and furiously alive, it is brightened by the same unlikely bonhomie that has long kept Ben afloat. First seen gaily loading up a shopping cart at the liquor store, Ben has a courtly charm that is as beguiling as it is erratic. He can move from high spirits to furniture-smashing rage in a matter of seconds, but he never has trouble getting attention. 
The film begins with an exceptional bender, following Ben through the last gasps of his career in Los Angeles. He turns obnoxious in a restaurant, name-dropping about Dickie Gere and annoying the movie executives he meets. He tries to pick up a woman in a bar. ("You've been drinking all day," remarks the woman, played by Valeria Golino. "But of course!" Ben replies.) He goes to a strip club, gets so drunk he can barely see the dancers and takes home a prostitute who steals his wedding ring. He wakes up on his kitchen floor, having passed out in front of an open refrigerator. 
For Ben, this appears to have been an ordinary day. 
Leaving Los Angeles after being fired from his job, Ben moves on to the city of the title, a very different place from the coarse, brassy setting for "Showgirls." This Las Vegas is a neon apparition, beautifully evoked by otherworldly contrasts and lurid nocturnal light. (The cinematography is by Declan Quinn, whose work is as subtly distinctive as it was in "Vanya on 42d Street.") And here he meets Sera, whose very name (as in "que sera") suggests some kind of cosmic shrug. Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a Las Vegas prostitute, has somehow been waiting her whole life for a man like this. 
As he did in his fine, fluid earlier films (before being sidetracked by the unaccountably listless "Mr. Jones" and "The Browning Version"), Mr. Figgis gives his narrative a musical dimension. A sometime musician who composed this film's jazzy score, Mr. Figgis uses a haunting soundtrack (with several vocal numbers performed by Sting) to turn this into a sustained, moody reverie. Indeed, the film's musical effectiveness minimizes some of its dramatic contrivance, especially where Sera is concerned. Ms. Shue gives a daring and affecting performance, but she's essentially playing one more whore with a heart of gold. 
The awkward device of letting Sera talk about herself on a therapist's couch doesn't give her much added depth, though her troubles with a sleazy Latvian pimp (Julian Sands, with a flamboyant accent) add some color. And the screenplay's attempt to create an 11th-hour crisis for Sera seems false, too. For all Ms. Shue's warmth, in the kind of gutsy, unflinching role that often goes to Jennifer Jason Leigh, "Leaving Las Vegas" never rings entirely true as a bleak love story. Ben clings to Sera as a last straw, but he's still a man alone. 
Mr. Cage digs deep to find his character's inner demons while also capturing the riotous energy of his outward charm. The film would seem vastly more sordid without his irrepressible good humor. 
At the same time, without overworking the pathos of Ben's situation, "Leaving Las Vegas" fully conveys the health risks of gulping vodka in the shower, crashing onto a glass coffee table or otherwise lurching through life with Ben's particular abandon. A man who spends $500 for a prostitute's hourlong visit to his $29 hotel room (with "complimentary bar of soap" and lucky aces over the headboard) is a man beyond caring about the future. 
"Leaving Las Vegas" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, profanity, sexual situations, graphic language, overall raunchiness and an enormous amount of drinking.

‽Hard Core Logo‽,‽''Hard Core Logo,'' a more straight-faced punk-rock descendant of ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' follows a fictional band from Vancouver on its chaotic, self-destructive farewell tour across western Canada. But unlike ''Spinal Tap,'' which cast a comically jaundiced eye on every nuance of the heavy-metal life style, this clever mock documentary, which opens today at the Screening Room, blends satire and sentiment in a way that keeps you emotionally off balance. 
For every suggestion that it is poking fun at the punk-rock esthetic (onstage, the bullying, alcoholic lead singer Joe Dick spits in the faces of his fellow band members), there are stronger hints that the movie, handsomely photographed by Danny Nowak, aspires to be a kind of romantic elegy to the punk-rock movement. As Hard Core Logo makes its way across the prairie, shots of its battered tour bus rolling through the farmland convey a mood of grand desolation. What does punk rock and its esthetic of defiance have to do with this landscape, you wonder? And what's to become of its four contentious rock rebels who are already well into their 30's? 
This melancholy atmosphere seeps into the scenes of the band's backstage squabbles, most of which revolve around the embattled relationship of the band's leader and prime mover, Joe (Hugh Dillon), and his lead guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie). Billy, who is waiting to hear whether he will be officially invited to join a big-time Los Angeles band, has temporarily rejoined Hard Core Logo. But once he's on board, Joe pressures him into promising not to leave. The movie toys with the possibility of a sexual relationship between the two but nervously backs off from investigating further. 
Rounding out the fractious foursome are its bassist John (John Pyper-Ferguson), a stammering manic-depressive on lithium who keeps a journal of the tour, and Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson), its loutish fun-loving drummer. 
To succeed, a movie like ''Hard Core Logo'' demands a certain credibility. And until the scene in which the group visits an English punk legend, Bucky Haight (Julian Richings), the movie feels real enough. But the idea that this gaunt, angry living  legend would retire to an isolated farmhouse in the Canadian heartland is ludicrous. 
When Bucky and the members of Hard Core Logo take a collective LSD trip that feels like a flashback to ''Easy Rider,'' the film becomes derailed. By the time the movie comes back on track for a nasty final scene, the game of ''is it or isn't it real'' hide-and-seek has long been lost. 
''Hard Core Logo'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and one scene of violence.

‽Cannibal! The Musical‽,‽Try to arrive a few minutes late for ''Cannibal: The Musical.'' That way you'll miss the revolting sight of bloody, amputated body parts, the trademarks of Troma, the filmmakers who gave the world ''The Toxic Avenger'' and ''Surf Nazis Must Die!'' After the gory first scene, the movie is not completely appalling. 
''Cannibal! The Musical,'' which was completed in 1994, is making it into theaters now largely because of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the young creators of ''South Park,'' Comedy Central's animated series about third graders and four-letter words. Mr. Parker wrote, directed and stars in the film. Mr. Stone plays a prospector and is one of the producers. Their work here is still amateurish but has flashes of real humor. 
The film is inspired by the true story of Alferd Packer (Mr. Parker), an 1870's gold prospector, and how he came to be convicted of cannibalism.  In the beginning, Alferd is a happy-go-lucky guy who loves his horse, Leanne, and just being alive, as you can tell from the lyrics of his first song: ''The sky is blue and all the leaves are green. The sun's as warm as a baked potato.'' A few lines later, he sings, ''My heart's as full as a baked potato.'' 
The men he travels with from Utah to Colorado are not a particularly bright or tough bunch. When they meet a group of trappers, they're horrified to learn that trapping involves killing little animals. When a man gets unruly, he's sentenced to a 20-minute ''time out.'' When they come across the Grand Canyon, one says: ''We'll just walk around it. It can't be that big.'' When they run into a band of ''Indians'' who are clearly Japanese, they don't notice anything unusual. 
Along the way, before the cannibalism, they build a snowman, encounter a Confederate cyclops and pursue a horse thief. Alferd tells his story to pretty Polly Prye (Toddy Walters), a sympathetic listener who turns out to be a reporter for The Denver Post. 
This all leads up to a huge musical number in which the jubilant townspeople dance and sing in the streets about the joys of watching a hanging. (A typical line: ''When his tongue rolls out, we'll know.'') 
It's all pretty stupid, but at times, there are refreshingly ludicrous notes that even people old enough to see this movie without a guardian can appreciate. One approach: Imagine the film taking place in ''South Park'' animation. If Cartman were ripping that man's arm off and eating it, it might be cute. 
CANNIBAL!

‽Talk to Me‽,‽Betty and Veronica are the focal females of ''Talk to Me,'' but the action is far from the teen-age angst of Archie Comics. 
''Talk to Me'' may have been made in 1996, but it is very much at home in 1998 because it revolves around telephone sex. 
In this amiable, modest romantic comedy opening today at the Quad Cinema, Betty and Veronica are facing the dread age of 30, and the romantic lives of these New Yorkers are not in the best of shape. 
Betty hasn't had sex in nine months. Veronica, or Ronnie as she is known, is still dating Stuart even though they have broken up because he said he wasn't ready for marriage. 
So one night Betty (Cheryl Clifford) succumbs to the temptation to dial the ''900'' number of the Universe of Love (''Tired of being judged before a person can get to know the real you?''), and soon she finds herself smitten with the voice of a young man named Arnold Dowling (Peter Welch). 
And not long after that, they are involved in a private telephonic chat, shucking off clothes and acting out a fantasy about a cleaning woman in a blue uniform, a white apron and high heels and some sudsy water. 
But Arnold, it seems, has a problem, which his brother Michael (Gary Navicoff), a psychiatrist, is trying to address. Arnold, an architect, has been traumatized by a devastating office romance. After a year, without warning, Maggie, Arnold's love, turned up one day wearing another man's engagement ring. 
What he cannot stand, therefore, is a liar, and what he has not yet discovered is that the woman he knows on the telephone only as Miranda is actually Betty. 
Well, one day Betty will actually track down the reticent Arnold, and they will have a date, which will lead to complications. And in the meantime, Veronica (Elizabeth Landis), will also decide to let her fingers do the trolling, which leads her into the lair and limo of the suave Frederick (Ralph Romeo). 
George Esguerra, who produced and directed ''Talk to Me'' and wrote the screenplay with Robert Foulkes, displays a nice understanding of the scars of the dating game, the difficulties of the mating game, the uses of guises and the elements of human comedy. ''Talk to Me'' holds no special surprises and reaches no heights of hilarity, but Betty and Arnold prove to be the sort of decent people who deserve a happy ending. 
TALK TO ME

At the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village. Running time: 87 minutes. This film is not rated.

‽My Mother's Courage‽,‽Holocaust dramas tend to be so relentlessly grim that ''My Mother's Courage,'' a smart, unsettling comedy edged with horror about a plucky Hungarian woman who narrowly escapes deportation to Auschwitz, requires a sharp adjustment of perspective. The tone of the film, which goes out of its way to avoid the customary solemnity surrounding its subject, veers unpredictably between warmhearted humor and savage irony. 
Based on true experiences of the mother of the Hungarian playwright George Tabori, the film was written and directed by Michael Verhoeven, whose acclaimed films ''The Nasty Girl'' and ''The White Rose'' also deal with Europe's Nazi past. ''My Mother's Courage'' maintains a semblance of realism until Mr. Tabori  himself pops up in a crowd scene and momentarily suspends the action. From that point on, the movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, never feels the same. 
As vivid fantasies and flashbacks abruptly intrude, the movie moves in and out of the self-protective reverie of its likable main character, a sheltered middle-class woman who can barely comprehend the horror into which she is briefly plunged. That nightmare begins on a hot summer afternoon in 1944 while Elsa (Pauline Collins), whose husband, a newspaper editor, is already in prison, is  strolling on the streets of Budapest. Two elderly policemen approach Elsa, and with an attitude of apologetic courtliness put her in handcuffs and escort her to a trolley that carries her to a crowded railroad station. 
Here she finds herself milling among hundreds of other Jews from the city who have been rounded up for deportation. But because the disposition of Budapest's Jews was conducted in secrecy and elaborate deceit, many were led to believe they would be relocated to Sweden. The atmosphere at the station is grotesquely anticipatory, almost festive. Even after the prisoners are harshly pushed into boxcars, a lingering optimism prevails. 
Instead of focusing on the terror and degradation, these scenes view the world through the innocent, still-trusting eyes of a woman who, despite having to wear a star identifying her as Jewish, has remained oblivious to the warning signs. The film finds an uncomfortable, absurdist humor in the spectacle of these doomed deportees behaving with such docile obedience in the face of their murderers. 
Elsa, whom Ms. Collins plays with a warm, watchful intensity, is a prototypical innocent whose naivete becomes a kind of protective armor. Even after she has been crammed into a boxcar, she remains stalwartly calm, offering comfort and hope to a young woman (Natalie Morse) who was brutally raped and routed from her home by green-shirted Nazis. Peering through the cracks in the train, she has memories of her idyllic childhood. 
Elsa's salvation is almost accidental. After the prisoners are unloaded in the countryside and herded to a filthy storage barn to wait for another train, Elsa is goaded by a fellow prisoner to protest her innocence. She finds herself pushed into a courtyard where she approaches the presiding officer (Ulrich Tukur) and improvises an excuse about a safe conduct pass she left at home. Either because he feels a mysterious connection to Elsa or out of sheer contrariness, he orders her returned to Budapest in his first-class compartment. On the trip back, her savior, a strict vegetarian, regales her with a gruesome story of human flesh-eating and revenge. 
''My Mother's Courage'' draws no moral conclusions about Elsa's deliverance. As she emerges from her ordeal, it remains a blip of unimaginable horror that will take a lifetime for her to assimilate.

‽The Bloody Child‽,‽Mixing extreme naturalism with surreal reveries and disembodied voices distractedly chattering jump-rope rhymes and fragments from ''Macbeth,'' Nina Menkes's eerie experimental film ''The Bloody Child'' demands a great deal of patience for it to weave its depressing spell. But once you surrender to the rhythm of its maddeningly repeated images and its laborious accretion of somber detail, the movie offers a suffocating vision of American military life as a lethal social malignancy. 
Much of the movie, which opens today at Anthology Film Archives,  was filmed in the vicinity of America's largest Marine base, at Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., in the Mojave Desert. The film, which uses real military personnel, also drops in on local country-and-western bars to observe the rowdy behavior of marines off duty. Additional scenes evoking the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath were shot in northeastern Africa. 
The kernel of the story traces and retraces the arrest of a marine after the brutal murder of his wife. But instead of indicting the thick-necked suspect, who is photographed only from the side and the back, the movie compiles a devastating portrait of the soul-deadening milieu in which the crime took place. 
Scenes of the arrest shot from a distance that leaves much of the dialogue inaudible show the marine,  who was caught trying to bury his wife in the desert before sunrise, being arrested and thrown in the back of a car. 
Now and then, the monotonous litany of officialese is jarringly broken with a sudden close-up of a military policeman shoving the marine's face into his dead wife's bloody lap and barking an obscenity. Tinka Menkes,  the film maker's sister, plays a marine captain who struggles to maintain an attitude of composure during the arrest. 
Overlaying these hypernaturalistic scenes are evocations of the slain woman's spirit intoning nonsense rhymes in a high girlish voice. There are visions of a naked woman covered with white powder, sprawled in the woods and writing mysterious signs on her arm. 
Finally, there is the appearance of a riderless black stallion on the crime scene. 
What does it all mean? Allusive, haunting and at moments almost intolerably dull, ''The Bloody Child'' leaves it to us to connect the dots of its pointedly feminist vision of hell on  earth. It is a macho thing.

‽Sleepover‽,‽Anyone who grew up in a middle-class American suburb and itched to be one of the in-crowd should feel an uncomfortable twinge of recognition while watching John Sullivan's debut film, ''Sleepover.'' This microscopic study of adolescent summertime angst in a Connecticut coastal town follows a group of bored teen-agers as they embark on a midnight outing that leads to catastrophe. 
Few movies have captured the intricacies of adolescent peer pressure more tellingly. With characters ranging from 14 to 18, ''Sleepover,'' which opens today at the Anthology Film Archives, observes how gradations of age and experience determine a ruthless teen-age pecking order. The youngest and most naive obligingly endure the contempt of the more sophisticated in order to learn how to follow in their footsteps. 
The leader of the group, Mark (Michael Albanese), is an insecure, hormonally fueled troublemaker driven by a nagging rage that could turn him into a criminal in the not-too-distant future. His companions include his haughty date, Brooke (Heather Casey); his much-abused sidekick, Sean (Karl Giant); two younger girls, Megan (Megan Shand) and Anne (Shannon Barry), and a black youth, Ken (Ken Miles), who is new to the area and whom Mark insistently race-baits. 
A movie that begins as a wispy slice of teen-age life builds into an unsettling portrait of a bully whose domineering behavior, recklessness and compulsive cruelty begin to alienate his friends. Mark brings whisky (and Brooke, marijuana) to the group's midnight party under a bridge, where Mark comes close to accidentally drowning Brooke after coercing her into sex. Afterward, she forgives him much too easily. 
Mark and Brooke represent every high-school couple drawn to each other by good looks who put on a show of bravado for themselves as much as for their companions. Sean is the class nerd who endures Mark's indignities in order to bask in his tormentor's macho glamour. When Megan loses her virginity to Sean, the reason seems to be curiosity and internalized peer pressure more than any burning attraction. 
How does one survive adolescence? Well, as ''Sleepover'' shows, in a sequence that recalls the endings of the French New Wave classics ''Jules and Jim'' and ''Contempt,'' some don't.

‽
‽Margaret's Museum‽,‽With a strong and colorful sense of its Nova Scotia setting, ''Margaret's Museum'' describes life in a remote coal mining community. It's an existence that the film's reckless, earthy heroine knows all too well. Rough-hewn Margaret MacNeil, played spiritedly by Helena Bonham Carter, has lost a father and brother to ''the pit,'' as the miners call it. And she works as a scrubwoman in the village hospital. Periodically throughout the film, which is set in the late 1940's and early 1950's, alarm bells sound as the hospital staff braces for new accident victims from underground. 
Growing up in this atmosphere has left Margaret wary of men. But the film involves her in a sweetly offbeat courtship once she meets Neil Currie (Clive Russell), a gentle soul who speaks Gaelic, plays the bagpipes and nicely embodies this film's quirky charm. (Heard on the soundtrack: traditional Scottish and Irish melodies with names like ''Jenny's Chickens,'' ''Boy's Lament for His Dragon'' and ''The Wedding Reel.'') 
Neil is also the namesake of Sheldon Currie, a professor of English who grew up in a mining family on isolated Cape Breton Island and eventually wrote the stories on which Mort Ransen's film is based. The relative popularity of ''Margaret's Museum'' in Canada owes a lot to the film's novelistic eye for Cape Breton, thanks to the author's keen evocation of his childhood home. 
Beyond its picturesque aspects, the film means to decry the hardships that the miners endure. The title image is a reference to their suffering, and it starts the film on a macabre note. A couple of tourists stop at Margaret's house, and when the woman sees the bathroom, she runs away screaming. What's in there? It's Margaret's form of protest against atrocious mining conditions. Still, if you're not Wes Craven, you may not want to know. 
Mr. Ransen directs this scene as an unsteady mix of horror and slapstick, which hardly bodes well for the rest of the story. But after this bizarre opening, ''Margaret's Museum'' slowly begins working its wiles. Ms. Carter so thoroughly shakes off her usual refinement that she plays this first scene in a flour sack looking like Little Orphan Annie. But she brings a headstrong exuberance to her wild, rebellious role. Mr. Russell, who stoops his 6-foot-6-inch frame down toward tiny Margaret as he beguiles her, makes himself a surprisingly romantic presence in Margaret's otherwise humdrum life. 
''Margaret's Museum'' surrounds Margaret and Neil with a solid set of supporting characters rather than embroiling them in a vigorous plot. (It remains clear that the characters come from separate short stories of Mr. Currie's.) The standout is Catherine MacNeil, Margaret's widowed mother, played by Kate Nelligan with a deadpan, caustic wit. ''I'm sure you'll be happy or miserable, as the case may be,'' Catherine says, by way of congratulating Neil and Margaret when they marry. ''Fair enough?'' 
Also floating through the film and flirting dangerously with life in the pit are Margaret's staunch Uncle Angus (Kenneth Welsh) and her impressionable young brother, Jimmy (Craig Olejnik), who finds himself dangerously attracted to the daughter of the mine's owner. In a company town full of debts to the company store, this isn't liable to work to Jimmy's advantage. 
Meanwhile, he must also contend with the determination of Catherine and Margaret to keep him out of the mine at any price. Jimmy's grandfather has such advanced black-lung disease that he needs to be whacked  on the back periodically to keep him breathing. 
Using music, wry anecdotes and hefty jugs of moonshine to capture the village atmosphere, ''Margaret's Museum,'' which opens today at the Quad, contrasts Margaret's craving for freedom with the grief she feels closing in. The film's sense of tragedy is as simple as a folk song's, but its hearty resilience is what makes it worth remembering. 
''Margaret's Museum'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief nudity, mild profanity and discreet sexual situations.

‽Nightjohn‽,‽Lest we forget, knowledge is power, and for slaves in the antebellum South, learning to read was forbidden. Some slaves who dared to become literate were punished by having a finger chopped off in front of the whole slave community. Or worse. 
Charles Burnett's powerful made-for-television film, ''Nightjohn,'' which was first shown on the Disney Channel last June, remembers those days through the voice of a motherless 12-year-old girl named Sarny (Allison Jones), who defies the law.  ''Nightjohn,'' which was based on a book by Gary Paulsen, opens a seven-film series of Mr. Burnett's work that begins today at the Walter Reade Theater and continues through Feb. 13. 
Although narrated in the simple, straightforward style of a typical family movie and filmed with a picture-book prettiness, ''Nightjohn'' is no cop-out when it comes to confronting the day-to-day horrors of slavery. Its representative slave owner, Clel Waller (Beau Bridges), is a conscienceless brute who terrorizes his field workers with beatings and humiliations and bullies his squeamish young son, Jeffrey (Joel Thomas Traywick), into following his example. 
Sarny's tutor is Nightjohn (Carl Lumbly), a rebellious slave purchased on the cheap who escaped to the North but returned to the South on a secret mission to teach slaves to read, no matter what the consequences. Sarny proves to be his brightest pupil, and when her literacy is discovered, she uses it to outwit her owner. Beautifully acted, with a superb teleplay by Bill Cain, the film  has the resonance of a classic fable. 
Presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in association with the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, the Burnett series honors the work of one of America's major black film makers, who made an astonishing debut in 1977 with ''Killer of Sheep,'' his neo-realist portrait of a Los Angeles meat packer. (That film has screenings today at 4 and 8:15 P.M.) 
Over the next two weeks ''Nightjohn'' will have 13 screenings, including today at 2 and 6:15 P.M., tomorrow at 6:30 P.M. and Sunday at 6:15 P.M. The Walter Reade Theater is at 165 West 65th Street, at the plaza level of Lincoln Center. Tickets are $8; $5 for Film Society members; $4 for the elderly at weekday matinees.

‽The Whole Wide World‽,‽When a young man points to the horizon and crows to his date that he ordered up a magnificent sunset just for her, you know you are not in the 1990's but back in some innocent long-ago, eons before the Weather Channel turned climatology into couch-potato entertainment. ''The Whole Wide World,'' which includes more than one such florid declaration, is set in the mid-1930's, in West Texas, to be precise. 
The character doing the ordering is Robert E. Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio), the pulp fiction writer best known for creating Conan the Barbarian. His companion is Novalyne Price (Renee Zellweger), whose 1985 memoir, ''One Who Walked Alone,''  from which the film was adapted, remembers her stormy friendship with Robert, who died by his own hand at the age of 30. 
Wonderfully acted by Mr. D'Onofrio and Ms. Zellweger, the movie, directed by Dan Ireland, is a deep, gently touching study of the relationship between two strong-willed individuals with big dreams and plenty of open sky under which to call them up. Novalyne, an aspiring writer, is a salty, down-to-earth young schoolteacher with a restless heart who knows how to stand up for herself. Ms. Zellweger, memorable in in ''Jerry Maguire,'' gives the character a blunt, twangy authenticity. 
Robert is a self-absorbed fantasist whose lurid adventure yarns are his escape from a world in which he doesn't fit. Inside the drab rural farmhouse where he lives with his  ailing mother and incommunicative father, he conjures up a make-believe life of heroic derring-do and  erotic adventure that shocks Novalyne's puritanical sensibility. 
The movie follows a volatile relationship that involves dates for movies like ''The 20th Century'' and that reaches its peak in an impulsive and dramatic kiss on a windswept bluff. The relationship begins to dissolve after Robert announces with characteristic grandiosity that he is not the sort of man to be tied down, and Novalyne, quite sensibly, draws back and begins dating someone else. 
Where films about writers tend to shy away from examining the creative process, ''The Whole Wide World'' finds comedy in Robert's intense involvement with the typewriter. The first time Novalyne visits him at his home, she hears him from  afar excitedly bellowing the words he is committing to paper. Scenes like these evoke the adrenaline rush that every writer feels during a creative streak when words and images are clicking into sentences and paragraphs. But the difference between almost every other writer and Robert is in the degree of his passion. Instead of finding a comfortable energy level and flowing with it, he becomes maniacally carried away. 
The movie's view of this disturbed young author finds just the right balance between affection and pity, admiration and criticism. Robert is a mama's boy under the spell of a seductive, sickly mother (Ann Wedgeworth) who is slowly wasting away from an unidentified illness. His slavish devotion, at once selfless and neurotically dependent, exacts a steep psychological price, and he is prone to violent tantrums. In the film's most unsettling scene, he becomes so enraged when his car won't start that he grabs a knife, rushes into a cornfield and furiously slashes away at everything in sight. 
But in Mr. D'Onofrio's finely shaded performance, Robert is as much a charmer as he is a problem child. He has a winning streak of gallantry,  and his enthusiasm and mental energy can be dazzling. 
''The Whole Wide World'' focuses so intently on Novalyne and Robert's friendship that it pays only cursory attention to the world around them. The other people in their lives are shadowy fringe figures. For all the characters' tumult, the emotional journey that the movie follows feels somewhat flat. When, at the very end, the tone of the film turns stickily sentimental, you can feel the movie awkwardly trying to sum itself up with a grand gesture. 
But how many movies have you seen lately that portray a complicated relationship between intelligent young adults exchanging thoughts about life and art who really listen to each other? ''The Whole Wide World'' does exactly that, and it's no mean feat. 
''The Whole Wide World'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There's some mildly salty language.

‽Some Mother's Son‽,‽Nothing in a recent film captures with more devastating force the perilous atmosphere of life during wartime than an early scene from ''Some Mother's Son.'' As the fresh-faced uniformed students at a Roman Catholic girls' school in Northern Ireland rehearse an elaborate step-dancing routine, a bomb explodes outside the classroom, smashing windows and inciting pandemonium where discipline and calm had prevailed an instant before. 
Helen Mirren, in one of the juiciest roles of her career, plays Kathleen Quigley, a widowed, stubbornly apolitical teacher in the school who is unaware that her son Gerard (Aidan Gillen) is one of the Irish Republican Army members who set off the blast. The scene in which this dashing, spirited young man borrows his mother's car under false pretenses and matter-of-factly wreaks destruction with his accomplices is one of the film's many disquieting moments. 
Kathleen's willful innocence is soon shattered during a Christmas dinner when police officers burst into her home and arrest Gerard as one of the bombers. Suddenly a woman who assiduously shunned the political fray in Northern Ireland finds herself in the thick of it. 
''Some Mother's Son,'' written and directed by Terry George, might loosely be described as the sequel to ''In the Name of the Father,'' the much-admired 1993 film for which he wrote the screenplay. For this film, Jim Sheridan, who directed ''In the Name of the Father,'' has ascended to the role of producer (one of three). 
The new film, which like its predecessor is based on fact, doesn't have a quirky central character like Gerry Conlon, the young Belfast layabout (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) who was wrongly convicted of being an I.R.A. terrorist and locked up for years. But it is pointedly more partisan in its portrayal of British Government officials as brutal, icy oppressors of a heroic, if tragically overzealous nationalist movement. And it uses film clips of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher damningly against her. 
Focusing on a much more famous real event, a 1981 hunger strike by I.R.A. members in Maze Prison in Belfast that left 10 dead, including the strikers' leader, Bobby Sands, ''Some Mother's Son'' is a more conventional docudrama. It interweaves fact and fiction with the crisp immediacy of a beautifully shot and edited news film. 
Ms. Mirren's character is an Everymother who, before the story ends, is forced to make an agonizing decision about whether to allow her son to die for his cause (which he is more than eager to do) or to interfere and exercise her legal right to save his life. By law, when a hunger striker lapses into a coma, a parent can sign a paper instructing that the striker be force-fed. 
The film parallels Kathleen's journey from apolitical pacifist to placard-waving pro-I.R.A. demonstrator, with that of Annie Higgins (Fionnula Flanagan), a belligerent I.R.A. supporter whose son Frank (David O'Hara) is arrested with Gerard. A stout, redheaded woman of blunt passions, Annie embodies the aggrieved, intransigent soul of Roman Catholic resistance to British rule. Ms. Flanagan's magnificent performance conveys a mixture of ominous militancy and maternal vulnerability that is as compelling as it is utterly believable. 
By contrast, Ms. Mirren scrupulously underplays Kathleen. In a role that could have been milked for tears, Ms. Mirren brings out Kathleen's tense, questioning determination to save her son while following her own political conscience. The character always seems to be anxiously hanging back from a display of feeling. She is too busy absorbing experience to waste time dissolved in grief. Because of their philosophical differences, the solid friendship that develops between the two mothers retains a lurking undercurrent of distrust. 
A good part of the film is devoted to dramatizing events that began in 1976, when the British Government changed its official policy toward jailed I.R.A. members and decided to treat them as criminal terrorists rather than political prisoners. The Irish nationalists refused to put on prison uniforms and donned blankets in protest. After the British retaliated by denying them bathroom privileges, they began smearing the walls of their cells with their excrement. 
In March 1981, Sands (who in the movie is Gerard's cellmate) began the hunger strike that ended 66 days later with his death. Less than a month earlier, he won a narrow victory over a Unionist candidate in a local election that generated furious political passions. His death made him an I.R.A. martyr, and his funeral in Belfast drew 100,000 mourners. 
As the film cuts back and forth between scenes of tight-lipped British officials and prisoners euphorically uniting in solidarity against their captors, you have the queasy sense of a war of nerves spinning out of control. Once the hunger strike is in full swing, the movie doesn't shy away from showing the physical ravages of starvation. 
The scenes in which the prisoners decide to step up their resistance and to die if necessary are at once rousing and extremely sad. While the film gives both Sands (powerfully played by John Lynch) and Gerard a vaguely Christlike aura, it doesn't swooningly give its heart to them. The perspective remains detached enough that one is forced to wonder why this game of lethal tit for tat had to escalate to such crazy extremes. At the same time, it conveys a chilling sense of forces so implacably antagonistic that only a miracle could reconcile their differences. 
''Some Mother's Son'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language and scenes of violence.

‽
‽I'm Not Rappaport‽,‽If anyone can capture the title, still held by W. C. Fields, of the movies' transcendent comic grouch, it is certainly Walter Matthau, who makes another impressive pass at it in the movie version of Herb Gardner's hit Broadway play ''I'm Not Rappaport.'' Every leathery crease, crag and wattle of the most lived-in face in show business attests to the fact that Mr. Matthau has been around for a while and survived some hard knocks. 
It is the face of a man who has earned the right to pine out loud for the good old days and to grumble about the world going to hell in a handbasket. For the typical Matthau misanthrope, theatrical crankiness is more than just a self-affirming shtick; it sets up a protective force field that keeps the demons of despair at bay. 
In ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' Mr. Matthau has one of the richest characters of his career, Nat Moyer, an 81-year-old unreconstructed New York Jewish radical, fantasist and troublemaker. The role, originally played on Broadway by Judd Hirsch, gives Mr. Matthau free rein as a storyteller, verbal pugilist and character actor. 
But Mr. Matthau's wonderfully engaged performance can't conceal the glaring weaknesses of the play, which Mr. Gardner adapted for the screen and also directed and which suffers mightily from its translation into a more realistic medium. ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' which opens today at the Regency Cinema, is essentially an extended two-man vaudeville routine in which Nat and his fellow octogenarian Midge Carter (Ossie Davis), meet on a bench in Central Park and carry on an antagonistic friendship. 
Until Midge calls his bluff, Nat poses as Hernando, a Cuban terrorist. When unmasked, Nat explains darkly that the character is his ''cover story.'' And as the movie slogs along, Nat assumes several other exotic identities, enlisting Midge as his sidekick in reckless, futile efforts to help others out of serious jams. 
When not play-acting in scenarios concocted by Nat, the two friends alternately reminisce and bicker like an old married couple. Midge, who is black, is about to lose his longtime job as superintendent of a building on Central Park West that has just gone co-op. In an elaborate ruse, Nat poses as a feisty lawyer and tries to intimidate Danforth (Boyd Gaines), the yuppie head of the tenants' committee, into keeping Midge on. When Nat's daughter Clara (Amy Irving) shows up in the park and threatens to put him in an old-age home, he invents an entire secret life and an illegitimate daughter in Israel who has offered to care for him. 
Nat's most ambitious scheme involves Laurie (Martha Plimpton), a young woman just out of drug rehabilitation who spends her days in Central Park sketching the scenery. Laurie's artistic idyll ends when her dealer, Cowboy (Craig T. Nelson), catches up with her, slaps her around and demands money she stole from him. Hoping to save Laurie from further abuse and possible murder, Nat and Midge, who have observed the scene from their bench, pay Cowboy a call, posing as a menacing Mafia don and his chauffeur. 
None of it is remotely believable. Although the movie imagines a surreal Central Park (one recurrent image is of an elegantly dressed man doing the tango with a mannequin in front of the Bethesda Fountain), the film fails to evoke the fanciful environmental equivalent of Nat's yarns. Flashbacks to Nat's childhood and recurrent fantasies of a beautiful woman he once saw in a library add a patina of wistfulness without deepening the story. 
Dialogue that aspires to be a down-to-earth New York vaudevillian echo of Samuel Beckett's metaphysical musings swings uneasily between forced whimsy and a treacly sentimentality. And the minor characters are stick figures. Even Mr. Davis's Midge amounts to little more than Nat's handy comic foil. 
But in Mr. Matthau's hands, Nat attains a crusty, cantankerous nobility. His rash, eccentric campaigns against injustice and cruelty are an old man's way of raging against the dying of the light, of trying to make a difference in an indifferent world. It is with an almost vengeful glee that Mr. Matthau brings home the play's message: Imagination is the best defense. 
''I'm Not Rappaport'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has one scene of violence and some strong language.

‽
‽Hamlet‽,‽Kenneth Branagh's fine, robust performance as Hamlet is the bright centerpiece of his lavish new version of the play. Heading a cast so stellar that majestic Blenheim Palace plays the role of Elsinore, Mr. Branagh holds court throughout a four-hour, 70-millimeter sumptuously appointed production that doesn't often lag. This ''Hamlet,'' like Mr. Branagh's version of ''Much Ado About Nothing,'' takes a frank, try-anything approach to sustaining its entertainment value, but its gambits are most often evidence of Mr. Branagh's solid showmanship. His own performance is the best evidence of all. 
Mr. Branagh remains a great popularizer of Shakespeare and now has the chance to speak some of the most famous lines in the English language as if they had just come to mind. He makes a dashing figure if not a terribly melancholy Dane, typifying this film's preference for bold strokes over gloomy introspection. 
Sometimes resorting freely to unlikely touches, this film has earthquake special effects and a horror-film look when its ghost arrives. There are torrents of confetti when Gertrude weds Claudius, and a final fencing match on a scale that Rocky might envy. In between, the film's many stars parade in velvet and braid through ornate chambers that are built on a cathedral scale. Alex Thomson's cinematography captures this swank atmosphere in all its gilt-edged glory. 
Sometimes this visual bravado can veer toward the absurd, as when the film finds Hamlet in the foreground of a snowy landscape. There's a huge army so far behind him that the lines of soldiers look like computer-generated whiskers. But most of this ''Hamlet'' is shrewder than that, with keen instincts for the essence of the play. The style here is unabashedly flamboyant, but it also works. 
With a cast so big-name and polyglot that it could be assembled almost as reasonably for a celebrity roast, Mr. Branagh still gets dedication to the text, which is presented here in its convoluted, Machiavellian entirety. Of course, when Robin Williams appears late in the relatively minor role of Osric, count on more than the expected number of close-ups to show Osric registering events around him. 
Some of the star turns are here for blatant marquee value and stand out as gratuitous. (Gerard Depardieu and Jack Lemmon, as Reynaldo and Marcellus respectively, are here only briefly and look understandably adrift.) Blink and you'll miss John Gielgud, who has no dialogue as Priam in a flashback role. But other casting ideas work impressively well (Charlton Heston cuts a grandly imposing figure as the Player King) or show worthwhile whimsy. Billy Crystal practically juggles skulls as the gravedigger who speaks of poor Yorick (and Mr. Branagh throws in a flashback shot of little Hamlet being amused by Yorick's clowning). But his presence suits the role and holds the attention. 
Among the play's more important figures, Derek Jacobi stands out as a superb, quietly calculating Claudius, and Julie Christie makes a heart-rending Gertrude. (She looks elegant but is done up to look far older than Mr. Branagh, who himself shows off a flattering blond coiffure and lean costumes with a nicely contemporary look.) As Ophelia, Kate Winslet gives a fervent performance that takes on even more heat thanks to the extra directorial flourish of showing flashback scenes of Hamlet and Ophelia in bed. 
With a huge cast that also includes Judi Dench, Rosemary Harris, Michael Maloney and Richard Briers, ''Hamlet,'' which opens today at the Paris Fine Arts Theater, has an omnibus quality that would waver without such a strong figure in the title role. As star and ringmaster, Mr. Branagh gets to the heart of ''Hamlet'' and goes to admirable lengths to take his audience there, too. 
''Hamlet'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, coarse Anglo-Saxonisms and a brief bedroom scene.

‽
‽The Evening Star‽,‽''The Evening Star,'' the wayward and needless sequel to ''Terms of Endearment,'' is so desperate to touch base with its predecessor that the new story's characters often reach for their scrapbooks to summon memories of the first film's dead heroine. Debra Winger's Emma, available only in snapshots and glowing references, is invoked over and over in a film that has few better ways to spend its time. 
''The Evening Star'' wobbles along for well over two hours and still seems uneventful, since it does little more than watch Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) cope pluckily with her grandmotherly problems.  Aurora, the Dolly Levi of suburban Houston, still has a big retinue of friends, servants and admirers. She also has the three grown children whom Emma left behind, and shepherding them provides many opportunities for cracker-barrel wisdom.  For instance: ''I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a mistake. I think we all create what we need.'' And, ''When you stop trying, you fade away.'' 
Ms. MacLaine cuts a tart, indefatigable figure who seems much tougher and more likable than anything she's given to say. ''The Evening Star,'' written and directed by Robert Harling from Larry McMurtry's weak follow-up to his own novel, surrounds her with a crew of wacky minor characters and lets her flit among them in fairly aimless fashion. Aurora's granddaughter is played by Juliette Lewis, who shouts all her dialogue patronizingly. Ms. Lewis does look dimly enough like Ms. Winger to prompt an ''Oh, she reminds me so much of Emma that it hurts.'' 
It hurts, all right -- especially when Jack Nicholson returns well past this film's 11th hour to join Ms. MacLaine for the brief, awful scene that gives the film its title. As the ex-astronaut Garrett Breedlove, he grandly assures Aurora that her life has ''a kind of perverse majesty'' and points out a similarity between the heroine and the evening star in the cosmos. ''She shines first, she shines brightest and she shines longest,'' Garrett windily intones. 
''Careful, Garrett,'' says Aurora.  ''Your soul is showing.'' 
Then she mentions that Garrett has walked on the moon. ''And you've walked on the earth,'' he declares solemnly. ''That's a nicer place.'' 
''The Evening Star'' also features Scott Wolf in the silly role of the granddaughter's boyfriend, an aspiring underwear model; Bill Paxton as Aurora's therapist, whose affair with his patient isn't especially racy or lively; and Miranda Richardson in the film's one bright, funny turn, playing the divorcee and clotheshorse who becomes Aurora's catty enemy. Marion Ross does a warm, sturdy job as the devoted housekeeper who has been kept too long under Aurora's wing. 
Following up on the first film's formula, ''The Evening Star'' eventually calls for crepe-hanging and tears. Swelling music and studied close-ups pave the way for these outbursts of emotion. A much more honest and touching valedictory note can be found in the performance of Ben Johnson, the courtly cowboy actor with the beautiful voice, who appeared in over 300 films and won a well-deserved Oscar for appearing in ''The Last Picture Show'' as Sam the Lion. He died in April, and ''The Evening Star'' is dedicated to his memory. 
''The Evening Star'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, brief nudity and sexual situations.

‽
‽Michael‽,‽John Travolta may be the only Hollywood star these days who can pull a movie out of a hat and make it dance on the head of a pin. And in Nora Ephron's winsome, wafer-thin comedy, ''Michael,'' his portrayal of a mischievous angel with the appetites of a trucker and the table manners of a 2-year-old puts the film on on its toes and sets it spinning. 
The character, a self-described archangel named Michael who is first encountered by a trio of journalists in an Iowa motel, makes one of the year's more memorable movie entrances. With a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his cumbersome angel wings looking sadly bedraggled, he plows into a bowl of breakfast cereal on which he has heaped enough sugar to send most ordinary mortals into shock. 
With cereal slopping down his stubbly chin, he casually reveals a hairy paunch that has expanded considerably in girth since the actor's buffed-up days of ''Stayin' Alive.'' Michael is, in short, the impishly grinning slob that many of us would like to be if we thought we could get away it. Pure id, with a streak of the practical joker, he also has a redeeming heart of gold. 
Three of the angel's breakfast companions -- Quinlan (William Hurt), Huey (Robert Pastorelli), and Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) -- are representatives of a sleazy tabloid called The National Mirror and have flown all the way from New York, dollar signs dancing in their heads, to see if he's for real. The fourth, Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton), is the motel proprietor who tipped them off. Michael agrees to be interviewed and photographed for a cover story, but not until he has been driven to Chicago. 
The movie follows the foursome and Huey's beloved dog, Sparky (an adorable mutt who happens to have his own byline in The Mirror), on a road trip that begins in Iowa and ends at the foot of the Sears Tower in Chicago. Along the way, Michael insists that they stop off at such zany (and underwhelming) tourist attractions as the World's Largest Ball of Twine. 
But if ''Michael,'' which opens tomorrow, fancies itself a heartwarming hybrid of ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Groundhog Day,'' it never achieves the emotional weight of those classics. The movie is so busy applying cute touches to everything and everybody that it forgets to devote enough attention to the souls Michael has come down to save. 
Mr. Hurt's Quinlan is a grim, cynical journalist who was dismissed from his job at a respectable newspaper after throwing an ill-considered tantrum and has worked for The Mirror ever since. Now he labors under the thumb of an editor who is a bullying maniac (a cartoonishly tyrannical Bob Hoskins). Mr. Hurt conveys an intriguing mixture of bitterness and vulnerability, but his role, as written, is far too thin for his eventual redemption to seem anything more than a ho-hum plot contrivance. Mr. Pastorelli's Huey, a streetwise old-time newspaperman with a big streak of sentimentality, is so underwritten as to barely register. 
Ms. MacDowell's Dorothy is a more complicated failure. A duplicitous corporate climber who pretends to be an expert on angels, she is a bundle of quirks that don't add up. An aspiring country music songwriter, she carries around a notebook in which she scribbles ideas for lyrics. In one of the movie's sweetest moments, she is coaxed onto the stage of a bar to sing and (helped by a little angelic magic from Michael) all her lyrical fragments miraculously coalesce into a funny autobiographical account of her three failed marriages. 
Michael, the celestial rescuer of these lives gone adrift, is far and away the most poignantly human character in the movie. As he explains, angels get to return to earth only so many times, and this is his last go-round. No wonder he is so voracious. Part of that appetite involves women. Michael gives off an irresistible fragrance that is described as smelling like cookies and caramel. And wherever he goes, women instinctively cluster around him like bees to honey. 
The movie handles his sexual magnetism delicately. In the only actual angelic coupling the film records, the voice of the delighted waitress he has picked up for the evening is heard through a motel wall exclaiming: ''Wings? Far out!'' If ''Michael'' does better at the box office than the season's other angelic movie offering, ''The Preacher's Wife,'' it may be because it isn't so prim; it has at least a whiff of sex. 
Like Ms. Ephron's blockbuster hit, ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' ''Michael'' uses pop songs with an unusually astute sense of how to underline a moment. Willie Nelson singing ''What a Wonderful World,'' Bonnie Raitt doing ''Feels Like Home,'' Van Morrison's ''Bright Side of the Road'' and Randy Newman drawling a witty ''Heaven Is My Home'' are among the musical numbers that give the movie a smart pop gloss. 
But it is Mr. Travolta who gives the movie a heart that it probably wouldn't have were any other actor to play the role. Well, yes, maybe Tom Hanks. 
The movie is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has sexual situations that are handled very discreetly. 
MICHAEL

‽
‽Scream‽,‽Having established himself as the best and most mischievous film maker currently working in the dead-babysitter horror genre, Wes Craven (of the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' films) is in the mood for parody. So ''Scream'' winks at everything from a virginal heroine in a flowered cotton nightie to ''the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life for one last scare.'' Along the way, proving it's not too detached to get down to business, ''Scream'' also finds time to disembowel a pretty young victim or two. 
Mr. Craven's characters here are so movie-wise that they sit around swilling beer and eating popcorn while they watch Jamie Lee Curtis flee a crazed killer on the television screen. If this seems cynical, it's meant to; after all, thrill-seeking adolescents are the prime audience for Mr. Craven's brand of titillation. 
But in ''Scream'' he wants things both ways, capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor. Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix. 
For instance, there is the plight of Drew Barrymore in the scary extended sequence with which the glossily well-made ''Scream'' begins. She's alone at night in a big, antiseptically clean house with a lot of windows, and one of the first things she does is put a container of Jiffy Pop on the stove. Then the phone rings. It's a creep. He's a sadist. He taunts her mercilessly until the windows are smashed, the house is a mess and the popcorn is on fire. 
''What do you want?'' she pleads. ''To see what your insides look like!'' he hisses. Sure enough, with her insides hanging out, Ms. Barrymore is eventually found swinging from a tree. It's easy to imagine the film's own teen-age partygoers having a high old time watching this very sequence on home video some day. 
Not much of ''Scream'' is that gruesome. And Mr. Craven does stage this attack with a taste for wry detail (Jiffy Pop?) that sends up the tricks of his gory trade. But when he savors the sight of terrified young girls in tight sweaters, ''Scream'' isn't all that funny, and in any case its brand of humor eventually proves one-note and thin. By the end of ''Scream,'' characters who have argued about whether horror movies are really harmful are being hacked, chopped and otherwise shown that horror can be very harmful indeed. 
The story features a picturesque small town and a clean-cut heroine (Neve Campbell) whose boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich, looking like a younger and more distant Johnny Depp) wants to have sex with her and whose mother died a horrible death. The mother's killer is still at large, and the anniversary of the murder is just around the corner. The principal is played by Henry Winkler and wonders aloud what the next generation is coming to. 
Meanwhile, the high school students talk worriedly about the evil in their midst. ''How do you . . . gut  someone?'' one young woman wants to know. As the schoolmates band together in close proximity to the forces of evil, a brittle, high-powered television reporter (Courteney Cox) shows up to exploit the town's troubles. 
Among the droller touches in ''Scream'' are the killer's mask, which is Edvard Munch by way of a trick-or-treat costume, and suspense scenes set in de rigueur locations like the high school bathroom. There is also an authoritative discussion about the rules of a horror-film party scene by characters who are in fact playing one. To wit: sex equals death in a horror film. Those who drink or take drugs will be killed off, too. And:  ''Never, under any circumstances, say 'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back!' '' But somebody ignores that lesson and winds up attached lifelessly to the garage door. 
''Scream'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sexual references and grisly violence.

‽
‽One Fine Day‽,‽''One Fine Day'' is about great looks, and not only because it stars Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney as one cute twosome. This film also revels in New York City at its touristy best, dashing madly among appealing landmarks all around the town. The list of locations ranges from the ''21'' Club to the Circle Line to Central Park to City Hall and includes the environs of Radio City Music Hall. That's where a big, bright, squeaky-clean romantic comedy of this sort might once have played. 
A 50's romp with a few glaring 90's touches (dueling cellular phones, frazzled single parents), ''One Fine Day'' makes for sunny, pleasant fluff. Both stars are enjoyably breezy, and there's enough chemistry to deflect attention from the story's endless contrivances. The screenplay by Terrel Seltzer and Ellen Simon is full of energetic wisecracks. But it's jokey rather than actually funny most of the time. 
The gimmick here is a single day's adventure that causes Melanie Parker (Ms. Pfeiffer) and Jack Taylor (Mr. Clooney) to meet by chance, argue a lot and then fall in love. They must accomplish this while both their children are home from school, and do it without any help from baby sitters, which keeps the pace frantic much of the time. The story covers a lot of ground without quite losing its by-the-numbers feeling. Maybe all concerned, including the director, Michael Hoffman (''Restoration''), could do this with their eyes closed, but that would mean missing a lot. 
Ms. Pfeiffer, who can seem as substantial as she is gorgeous even in silly roles, plays a workaholic architect with a 5-year-old son. In one of the film's rare real-life moments, she's first seen paying bills at midnight and trying to get a decent night's sleep despite the best efforts of little Sammy (Alex D. Linz). 
The next morning, these two are understandably late for school. So is Maggie (Mae Whitman), the 5-year-old daughter of Jack, a Daily News columnist who is famous enough to have his handsome mug plastered on the side of buses. 
It's hostility at first sight for Melanie and Jack, whose exaggerated feuding is supposed to show how diametrically different they are. She is the stern type, while he's a big kid who loves clowning around. She looks neat and pulled-together until the film douses her with cranberry juice, leaves her standing out in the rain and otherwise calls for a fashion makeover. Meanwhile, he has an attractively rumpled look, either despite or because of the two hair stylists credited with working on Mr. Clooney. 
The film goes to needless lengths to let some of its minor characters coo admiringly about Mr. Clooney. But he's such a natural as a movie star that he hardly needs false flattery. Ms. Pfeiffer, meanwhile, shows a flair for physical comedy (will the tense architect fall down and crush her model buildings?) and has some charming mother-son scenes with little Alex. Both children are effortlessly likable and easily hold up their end of this ensemble comedy. 
Robert Klein has one very funny scene as Mr. Clooney's solemn psychotherapist. There's are also some amusing moments featuring Jon Robin Baitz as the younger of two prospective clients whom Melanie wants to impress. In the newspaper world, Charles Durning oversees Jack's efforts to blow the lid off the mob and the Mayor in a single muckraking story, while Ellen Greene is garish fun as Jack's secret weapon. Jack's competition at The New York Post is played briefly by Pete Hamill, who would now actually be Jack's editor in chief at The Daily News. 
''One Fine Day'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes profanity much too mild to keep children away.

WITH: Michelle Pfeiffer (Melanie Parker), George Clooney (Jack Taylor), Mae Whitman (Maggie Taylor), Alex D. Linz (Sammy Parker), Robert Klein (Dr. Martin), Jon Robin Baitz (Yates Jr.) Charles Durning (Lew), Ellen Greene (Elaine Lieberman) and Pete Hamill (Frank Burroughs). 
‽
‽My Fellow Americans‽,‽Is it just coincidence that Jack Lemmon and James Garner, as bickering ex-Presidents in ''My Fellow Americans,'' look a lot like George Bush and Richard Nixon? Probably not. In this funny, farcical spoof of Presidential mediocrity, greed and arrogance, any resemblance to an American statesman living or dead is pure gravy. If the moviegoing public guffawingly laps up the film's bone-deep cynicism, it will be a sign of just how tarnished the nation's highest office has become since Watergate. 
''My Fellow Americans'' (''Grumpy Ex-Presidents'' would have been a more descriptive title) finds the former chief executive Russell P. Kramer (Mr. Lemmon), a Republican, and his longtime Democratic foe, ex-President Matthew Douglas (Mr. Garner), fleeing for their lives. Because of an unwinding political scandal involving their corrupt White House successor, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), certain parties have decided that they should die together in a helicopter crash and be assigned posthumous blame for the new President's glaring ethical lapses. 
Bailing out of the aircraft before it explodes, they find themselves on the lam in the American heartland, dependent for survival on everyday people whose lives they never particularly cared about while they were in the White House. 
There are moments when ''My Fellow Americans,'' directed by Peter Segal and acted with an exhilarating comic gusto by Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Garner, has the makings of a classic American comedy in the Preston Sturges mode, but the screenplay rarely makes the most of them. As the hitchhiking ex-Presidents listen to a truck driver spout historical gibberish confusing Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Davy Crockett, Kramer can't prevent himself from haughtily correcting him, and the pair find themselves summarily ejected from the vehicle. 
Soon after that, they are caught up in a swarm of illegal immigrants fleeing a helicopter pursuit. One Hispanic fugitive pauses long enough to deliver a fervent, misty-eyed speech about his dream of attaining American citizenship. Although these moments offer rich opportunities for pathos and irony, not to mention witty political dialogue, the movie all but throws them away. 
The zaniest sequence finds the duo blundering into a small-town gay pride march and falling in step with a marching band whose members, costumed like cookie-cutter Dorothys from ''The Wizard of Oz,'' are strutting to a martial arrangement of ''Over the Rainbow.'' After being safely escorted from the parade to Cleveland by a cadre of black-leather-clad women on motorcycles, Kramer allows that he was wrong; he should have welcomed gay enlistees into the military. 
Although Kramer and Douglas never did anything illegal while in office, both admit ruefully to having done the politically expedient thing instead of exercising bold leadership. Douglas was a womanizer who regularly took advantage of a secret passage known as ''the Kennedy door'' to spirit women in and out of the  White House. In his retirement, he has been tirelessly flogging a Presidential cookbook. 
Kramer, since leaving office, has shilled for a Japanese insurance company and even danced with a panda at a corporate function. He is also a petty chiseler who, when staying in a fancy hotel, consumes the minibar's supply of vodka, then refills the little bottles with water. A good portion of the dialogue between the two consists of genially traded insults. 
Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Garner are such pros that they carry the movie smoothly over its dull patches. The chemistry between the two pits Mr. Lemmon's pious, sourpussed worrywart against Mr. Garner's expansive, unflappably blithe hedonist. The rest of the cast has little more than walk-on roles. Mr. Aykroyd's President is a myopic dolt, and John Heard's Vice President is a caricature of Dan Quayle (who smugly pronounces facade ''fakade''). Everett McGill is a diabolical Army colonel so absurdly villainous that he seems to have stepped out of a Nazi melodrama. 
''My Fellow Americans,'' doesn't get to the heart of any issue, constitutional, legislative or otherwise. But it has a fine time imagining our leaders as bumbling, thin-skinned, ultimately likable misfits who are as lost on the American highway as everybody else. 
''My Fellow Americans'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some of the insults exchanged get pretty salty. 
MY FELLOW AMERICANS

‽
‽Beavis and Butt-Head Do America‽,‽''Beavis and Butt-head Do America,'' the nastily amusing feature film debut of those tittering, pig-snorting MTV cartoon groundlings, finds the duo coping with the worst of all possible fates: the theft of their precious television set. Unable to soak in music videos from morning till night, and unable to sleep without the drone of television to lull them, America's most libidinous couch potatoes leap at the first job opportunity that presents itself. 
When a sinister thug named Muddy hires them to fly to Las Vegas and ''do'' his ex-wife, Dallas, for $10,000, they fail to realize that ''doing'' someone in Muddy's vocabulary isn't the same thing as doing someone in theirs. It won't be long, these chronically dateless dodos gloatingly assure each other, until they are virgins no more. 
Beavis and Butt-head, who first mooned their way into American living rooms three years ago, might just be the ultimate symptoms of the decline of Western civilization via television. Then again, they just might not. 
There is something (dare one use the word?) reassuring about these nincompoops, who are cruder and geekier than their most loutish fans. As they snicker their way through adventures that take them from Las Vegas to the White House by way of Hoover Dam, the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park, Beavis and Butt-head reveal a geographical ignorance that is stunning enough to make the most learning-challenged junior high school student feel like an Einstein. 
But what gives Beavis and Butt-head some claim to universality isn't their smug stupidity as much as a hormonal desperation so acute that when they find themselves on a tour bus filled with nuns, Butt-head exclaims, 'Hey, Beavis! We're on a bus with chicks!'' They distill the agony of adolescence, the queasy feeling of being trapped in a body going through monstrous changes, at the same time that they purge it of its terror. 
As resilient as Punch and Judy, as unshakably optimistic as Candide, they are myopically self-absorbed to the point that they are incapable of embarrassment. Their most excruciating humiliations are only minor setbacks in a continually frustrated quest for the juicy sex that their beloved music-videos teach them should be as abundant as sunshine. 
''Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' has the same double vision as the MTV series from which it is spun. It views the world simultaneously through the porcine eyes of its characters and through the cooler perspective of their creator and cartoon voice, Mike Judge. If the movie is any reflection of Mr. Judge's personality, he is a cynical, wised-up version of them, a slickie who knows how to ''score'' with women and who has imbibed enough smart drinks to translate his characters' instinctual nihilism into sleek cartoon imagery and trendy sound bites. 
As the duo make their way from New York to Las Vegas to Washington, they wreak havoc everywhere they go but still end up being honored by a cartoon Bill Clinton dispensing drippy platitudes. The disasters they create, and for which they miraculously escape blame, include the worst car pile-up in the history of superhighway mishaps and a devastating flood. 
The movie gleefully thumbs its nose at anyone who pretends to be grown-up, from the President on down. There is the little old lady who plies Beavis with the ''No-Drowz'' caffeine pills that bring out his obnoxiously scatological alter ego. There is the high school principal who expels the pair for trying to steal a television from the school's audiovisual lab and whom the pair discover being spanked by a prostitute. There is the hippy-dippy high school teacher who leads his students in a ludicrous folk-singing ode to a lesbian seagull. 
Finally, there is the country's chief investigator (Robert Stack), who sets a flock of armed Federal agents on their trail and grimly orders ''full cavity searches'' of everyone who has crossed their paths. 
By the time Beavis and Butt-head have ended their cross-country tour and many searches have been conducted, America has definitely been done, and in more ways than one. 
''Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Although the dialogue has no profanity, it is loaded with sexual and scatological double-entendres. 
BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA

‽Carla's Song‽,‽It's hard to imagine a more unlikely visitor to Central America in wartime than George (Robert Carlyle), an unemployed Scottish bus driver who is astounded to find himself in mortal peril jouncing along a rutted mountain road in Nicaragua with a group of soldiers dressed in camouflage. It is 1987, when right-wing contras are waging a guerrilla war against the leftist Sandinista Government, and George has impulsively flown all the way from Glasgow with his Nicaraguan fiancee Carla (Oyanka Cabezas) on a risky quest that could turn out to be a wild-goose chase. 
George's culture shock and political awakening form the emotional core of Ken Loach's angry and sorrowful film ''Carla's Song,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinema. This intermittently powerful film, directed from a screenplay by Paul Laverty, is never quite sure of what kind of movie it wants to be. In its early scenes, which have a documentary-like realism, it appears to be a microscopic examination of the life of a discontented city worker whose chafing at the rules of his job have an unexpectedly shattering effect on his life. Later, it becomes a somewhat unwieldy allegory in which the search for a casualty of war assumes Conradian allegorical overtones. 
The bus driver's journey into a strange new life begins when he takes pity on a mysterious passenger who is being harassed by the police for not paying her fare. George's resistance, along with other small acts of rebellion, cause him to be dismissed from his seemingly secure job. And when he befriends and falls in love with the passenger he defended, a beautiful Nicaraguan refugee named Carla who dances in the streets to raise money for the Sandinista cause, the rigid moorings of his life become untethered. 
Carla, whom Ms. Cabezas portrays with a quicksilver intensity that cuts against acting cliches, turns out to be a lot more trouble than George had bargained for. Suffering from post-traumatic stress, she is suicidal. As bits and pieces of her story emerge, George becomes convinced that the only way she can conquer her demons is to return to Nicaragua to find a former lover and fellow Sandinista named Antonio, who was caught and tortured by the contras and who has since disappeared. 
At this point, ''Carla's Song'' lurches boldly but unsteadily into a hybrid of quasi documentary, angry political tract and turgid fable. Abruptly moving from Glasgow to Nicaragua, the movie plunges you into the state of dazed bewilderment that George experiences in his first few days abroad. And in the not terribly believable figure of Bradley (Scott Glenn), a hard-boiled former C.I.A. operative who is now a conscience-stricken worker for a human rights organization, it also gives the movie its blunt political mouthpiece. 
A former enemy turned advocate of the Sandinista cause, and a witness to unspeakable C.I.A.-sponsored atrocities, Bradley is bursting with secrets, most of which are withheld until the end of the film. It turns out he knows where the elusive Antonio is living. The movie wastes valuable time withholding information to build up a bogus head of suspense that turns out not to have been justified once the ugly but unsurprising facts are revealed. 
''Carla's Song'' is at its most effective in scenes that feel semi-improvised, in which George breaks through the barriers of language and culture to establish a warm camaraderie with Sandinista soldiers and peaceful villagers who are under attack from the contras. Its portrait of an idealistic peasant-based army and its supporters standing up to a ruthless enemy is unabashedly nostalgic for the leftist dream the Sandinistas once represented. 
CARLA'S SONG

‽The Hanging Garden‽,‽The drama of an urbane gay man returning to the provinces to confront the ghosts of his troubled youth is such a familiar scenario that it hardly bears repeating. But Thom Fitzgerald's film ''The Hanging Garden,'' which veers wildly between harrowing kitchen-sink realism and surreal fantasy, adds enough bizarre touches (including the naming of its characters after various herbs and flowers) to this version of the prodigal son parable that it reinvents the formula. 
One unsettling message conveyed by the Canadian film is that no matter how drastically you may overhaul your physical image, beneath your bright and shiny new shell, a wounded, frightened child still lurks. All you have to do to find him is go home again. As the movie skips around in time and shows its grown-up characters observing their younger selves, it suggests that as we grow up we become like redwood trees: all the layers of our lives down to our very cores exist at the same time. 
When the film's main character, Sweet William (Chris Leavins), visits his Nova Scotia family for the first time in 10 years, this formerly obese teen-ager is so svelte as to be hardly recognizable. No sooner has he returned for the wedding of his older sister Rosemary (Kerry Fox) than he begins seeing younger versions of himself, including the suicidally inclined 350-pound teen-ager (played with a sullen poker-faced dignity by Troy Veinotte) that he used to be. 
The home to which William returns is a rats' nest of bitterness, illness and domestic violence and the wedding itself a chaotic, drunken affair. The bride, on her way to the ceremony, mutters a stream of angry curses. After the wedding, the groom (Joel S. Keller) on whom the teen-age William had a serious crush, makes a pass at the man who once adored him. 
In the middle of the ceremony, William's fanatically religious grandmother, Grace (Joan Orenstein), who suffers from Alzheimer's, shouts crazily out of the window of her attic sick room. By the end of the afternoon, his father, Whiskey Mac (Peter MacNeill), a gardener, has passed out. Hours later, William's long-suffering mother, Iris (Seana McKenna), simply disappears. At the wedding, William also meets and bonds with Violet (Christine Dunsworth), a frisky, tomboyish little girl who is introduced as his younger sister but who is not what she seems to be. 
Some of the movie's strongest moments evoke the excruciating tension and claustrophobia of growing up in a dysfunctional family. A scene in which Whiskey Mac brutally lashes out and smacks his teen-age son while Iris watches helplessly, barely containing her rage, is so harsh it makes you wince. So is another flashback, in which Iris, alarmed by her teen-age son's recently discovered homosexual tendencies, drags him to the home of a prostitute to be sexually initiated and waits outside the bedroom, listening to the creak of bedsprings, until the deed is done. 
''The Hanging Garden'' is powerfully acted, but its wild gyrations of tone never find a stylistic equilibrium. If the wedding is staged as a black comic farce, other scenes, including a fantasy in which the teen-age William hangs himself in the backyard, have a mawkishly self-pitying undertone. And there are many moments when the lines between fantasy and realism, between farce and drama seem unnecessarily hazy. 
''The Hanging Garden'' suggests that what's called the bosom of the family is rarely a soft and comforting home in which to nestle. It's much more likely to be a bitter cul de sac in which the best defense is a timely escape. 
''The Hanging Garden'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanity.

‽Oscar and Lucinda‽,‽Without doubt, there is no more eccentric story to be found on-screen right now that ''Oscar and Lucinda,'' in which love, glass, Christianity and gambling somehow collide. As directed exquisitely by Gillian Armstrong in a headstrong spirit that recalls her debut feature, ''My Brilliant Career,'' this elliptical tale makes up in visual beauty whatever it lacks in universal meaning. 
Which is a lot, given the quirkiness of Peter Carey's Booker Prize-winning novel. The book's descriptive elegance and richly peculiar imagination would give the film a pedigree like that of ''The English Patient'' even without the presence of Ralph Fiennes, but this tale is much more remote. With the singularity of what might be a real family history, it lets a present-day male narrator tell of Oscar Hopkins (Mr. Fiennes) and Lucinda Leplastrier (Cate Blanchett), kindred spirits who shaped that narrator's ancestral past. Also vital to the story of his creation are a glass church and a bet on whether it can be moved from Sydney to the remote north of Australia. 
Red-haired, bashful Oscar is birdlike and shy, having been cowed early in life by a punitively devout father who disapproves even of such indulgences as Christmas dessert. (''Dear God,'' the boy prays, ''if it be Thy will that people eat pudding, smite him!'') Lucinda, equally delicate in her own way, is also an heiress who becomes fascinated with the manufacture of glass. (As I said, this is one odd story.) 
Before they meet, each has become addicted to gambling, although Oscar's eventual career as an Anglican minister does make it difficult for him to find suitable outlets. But this is a film whose offbeat charms include the sight of clergymen betting about whether a tablecloth can be yanked sharply without anything on the table spilling. In their own way, once they meet and develop an instant affinity, Oscar and Lucinda find winsomely unexpected ways to gamble on life and love. 
While Ms. Armstrong tells the long, rambling story of her characters with more than enough vigor to sustain interest, the film's most extraordinary aspect is its wonderfully luxuriant look. Gorgeously photographed by Geoffrey Simpson (''Shine''), it offers a steady supply of visual surprises within compositions quite suitable for framing. Making rhapsodic use of natural light and of carefully chosen objects, this is a film that can find something gorgeous even in a boatload of cauliflower. Other strong visual assets are Luciana Arrighi's production designs, which lavishly transport the story from England to Australia, and the spectacular costumes by Janet Patterson (''The Piano,'' ''The Portrait of a Lady''). The film often revels in its heroine's vivid personality by crowning her with something like a strikingly embroidered fez. 
Ms. Blanchett, whose strength and vivacity recall the young Judy Davis of ''My Brilliant Career,'' is appealingly well teamed with Mr. Fiennes, who manages to make Oscar as bashfully likable as he is quaint. Despite the story's various sidetracks (involving Ciaran Hinds as another clergyman who admirers Lucinda, and Tom Wilkinson, who will forevermore be remembered for ''The Full Monty''), the film's essential sweetness and mystery come from two lonely people and the cosmic roll of the dice that brings them together. 
''Oscar and Lucinda'' is rated R. It includes profanity, much repressed longing and a sexual interlude.

‽
‽An American Werewolf in Paris‽,‽Why would three red-blooded American boys be champing at the bit to visit Paris? To visit the Louvre? No way. The only thing on the minds of these three smirking teen-age airheads who find more trouble than they could ever have anticipated in ''An American Werewolf in Paris'' is accumulating ''sex points'' on their competing mental scorecards. 
No sooner have they sneaked into the Eiffel Tower after visiting hours than Andy (Tom Everett Scott), the least obnoxious of the three, falls literally head over heels with a weepy French girl who makes a suicide leap from the observatory. Andy, who has come equipped with rope for performing his own daredevil stunts, dives after her and saves her life. 
It turns out, of course, that the woman he rescues, Serafine (Julie Delpy), has ample reason to want to die. She was recently turned into a werewolf by her sinister skinhead boyfriend, who hangs out with his buddies in a Parisian nightclub that Andy and his pals visit. Far from loathing their lupine, blood-guzzling alter-egos, the werewolves who run the place are sick and tired of having to wait for the moon to rise before feasting on human (preferably American) bodies. They have discovered a serum that can transform them into monsters at any time of day or night. And the climax of their nightly parties is a carnivorous, drug-choreographed rampage. 
''An American Werewolf in Paris,'' directed by Anthony Waller, is only distantly related to the 1981 John Landis film ''An American Werewolf in London,'' which mixed horror and comedy with considerably more panache. A slapdash, poorly acted, paint-by-numbers teen horror comedy, the sequel is too frenetically edited to build any suspense, and its special effects are strictly  bargain basement. 
The movie does have one nastily amusing sequence in which Andy, while undergoing the metamorphosis from man into monster, picks up a lustful, squealing girl named Amy (Julie Bowen) who becomes increasingly aroused the more the beast in him comes out. But only up to a point. Naturally Amy is punished for her libido and quickly dispatched into the realm of the undead. But even after becoming a zombie, she hasn't lost her style. Lamenting the loss of her teen-age beauty, she whines petulantly about the hundreds of hours she wasted honing her shape on the StairMaster. 
''An American Werewolf in Paris'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of gory violence, some  profanity and glimpses of nudity.

‽
‽The Postman‽,‽Every truly awful movie epic has a point of no return, a moment when the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is an awed amusement. If you have a low tolerance for mawkish jingoism, Kevin Costner's post-apocalyptic Western, ''The Postman,'' offers a new opportunity for levity every few minutes after its first hour. 
There is the moment when a girl, too young to have lived before a series of catastrophes destroyed the United States as we know it, begins singing ''America the Beautiful'' in a quavery little voice. There's the moment when a grizzled 68-year-old survivor, asked about the tattoo on his arm, becomes misty-eyed as he recalls ''a little girl with eyes as wide as saucers in a little town called Saigon.'' Or how about Mr. Costner's solemn christening of a pioneer community ''Elvis, Ore.''? 
In a fable that makes the delivery of mail a metaphor for the rebuilding of civilization, there are also impassioned group recitations of the letter carrier's oath delivered by teen-agers with the fervor of the Pledge of Allegiance in an American Legion hall. 
It didn't have to be this way. ''The Postman,'' adapted from a novel by David Brin, is set in the year 2013, when all that remains of the United States are scattered primitive settlements in the Northwest. This worst-possible scenario of the near future is plausible enough to cause shivers the more you consider it. Mr. Costner, who produced, directed and stars in the movie, has tried to turn it into a classic 1950's-style western in which he is the revivified embodiment of that hoary movie archetype, the Man With No Name. The outlaws are an army of warriors, the Holnists, led by the brutal General Bethlehem (Will Patton), who punishes his soldiers for minor infractions of discipline by stringing them up by the heels and slashing their throats. His army terrorizes this feudal pioneer society, extorting tribute and forcibly recruiting soldiers. Eventually the nameless hero and the evil general face each other down in a ''High Noon''-like confrontation. (Mr. Costner's physical resemblance to Gary Cooper is positively eerie in some scenes.) 
Mr. Costner's character, a shipping clerk in his former life, assumes his heroic identity when he discovers a pack of undelivered mail and a postal uniform in a rusted mail truck with a skeleton at the wheel. Donning the outfit, he delivers the mail to a nearby settlement and stirs up hope by improvising a credible yarn about being a representative of the newly restored government now based in Minneapolis. Accepted as genuine, the Postman quickly becomes a symbol of hope, and the guiding force behind a teen-age army of letter carriers who recognize the American flag and begin linking communities with a 21st-century Pony Express. 
''The Postman'' knows no restraint. Every scene is played to the hilt for its mythic, tear-jerking potential, and after a while (the movie runs nearly three hours) the accumulated sentiment begins to curdle. The dialogue, a numbing succession of western-movie cliches, is spoken with a cartoon-balloon emphasis that makes it seem all the more phony. The Postman's most dedicated disciple, a boy who has named himself Ford Lincoln Mercury (Larenz Tate), is such an obnoxiously eager little beaver that you keep hoping he'll be disposed of before the movie's over. (No such luck.) 
Mr. Costner, star that he is, comfortably holds the screen, exuding an indefatigable decency even as this shamelessly corny, ham-fisted movie suggests rampant narcissism below his friendly surface. As a bald-faced exercise in cinematic self-deification, ''The Postman'' makes Barbra Streisand's ''Mirror Has Two Faces'' seem almost modest. 
''The Postman'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has glimpses of nudity and scenes of violence.

Running time: 170 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽
‽Mr. Magoo‽,‽''Mr. Magoo'' is three movies for the price of one, and it's still no bargain. 
This schizoid stab at comedy is bracketed at beginning and end by animation that resurrects the severely myopic, supremely self-confident blundering gasbag of the popular UPA cartoons of the 1960's. But shortly after it begins, ''Mr. Magoo'' trots out Leslie Nielsen as the live version of the old fool. Then, apparently because the charm of a one-joke character created for short films is unsustainable over feature length, ''Mr. Magoo'' decides to have a go at comic adventure. 
Poor old Mr. Magoo should have been allowed to rest in piece. This film suggests that when you loot a crypt, you're likely to find a corpse. 
Neither the writers, Pat Proft and Tom Sherohman, nor Stanley Tong, the director, who came out of Hong Kong to direct Jackie Chan vehicles like ''Rumble in the Bronx'' and ''Supercop,'' manage to breathe life into the Magoo of the 1990's. 
Yes, he still can't see well enough to drive safely. He mistakes the decorations on a woman's hat for canapes at a black tie party. He locks himself inside a sarcophagus, thinking it is a phone booth. He spends a good deal of time tossing a priceless ruby into his topiary in the belief that the gem is a plaything for his bulldog, Angus, who is the film's liveliest, most interesting character. 
The ruby, known as the Star of Kuristan, is the fuel that drives the movie. Stolen just after Magoo, as an eggplant-canning factory magnate and patron of the arts, has dedicated a new museum wing housing the jewel, it is accidentally dropped into his fishing tackle box. The thief is Luanne (Kelly Lynch), a deceitful cat burglar watched over by Bob Morgan (Nick Chinlund), a clumsy henchman employed by Austin Cloquet (Malcolm McDowell), who has hired Luanne and is planning to sell the ruby at a convention of the world's great criminals. 
Before ''Mr. Magoo'' comes to an end, two feuding F.B.I. and C.I.A. operatives (Stephen Tobolowsky and Ernie Hudson) have decided that Magoo is the thief; Luanne pretends to fall for Magoo in an effort to find the ruby; Magoo's helpful nephew, Waldo (Matt Keeslar), is smitten with Kuristan's lovely representative (Jennifer Garner), and Magoo not only masquerades as a deadly criminal named Peru but also travels to Brazil to find Peru. (It's a geography joke.) 
Mr. Tong, whose specialty is action, makes the last portion of the film, involving the criminals' convention, the intervention of the authorities and the showdown with Peru in Brazil, move at a lively pace when it is not slowing down to search for comedy in an encounter between Magoo and a mandrill he mistakes for a child. 
Incomplete as a cartoon, indecisive as comedy, halting as adventure, ''Mr. Magoo'' turns out to be a shortsighted project. 
''Mr. Magoo'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It contains some menace and mayhem.

‽
‽Jackie Brown‽,‽Having rested extensively on his laurels, Quentin Tarantino returns to feature-film directing after ''Pulp Fiction'' with what might as well be two new crime tales, both called ''Jackie Brown.'' The better of these, halfway visible, is a quick and lean adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ''Rum Punch'' replete with pop asides, shrewd maneuvering and all the casually hip hallmarks of the Tarantino style. But you'll have to look hard to find it within the slower, talkier, more sluggish ''Jackie Brown'' that actually appears on screen. 
Running nearly as long as ''Pulp Fiction'' even though its ambitions are more familiar and small, ''Jackie Brown'' has the makings of another, chattier ''Get Shorty'' with an added homage to Pam Grier, the Annie Oakley of 1970's blaxploitation. That could well have been enough, since Mr. Tarantino shows such obvious affection for his leading lady and for the cheerful, greedy lowlife in Mr. Leonard's stories. 
But for all its enthusiasm, this film isn't sharp enough to afford all the time it wastes on small talk, long drives, trips to the mall and favorite songs played on car radios. And although Ms. Grier makes an enjoyable comeback, she isn't an actress well served by quiet stretches of doing nothing before the camera. 
Ms. Grier plays the title role of a  flight attendant caught in a trap between Federal authorities (with Michael Keaton as an overconfident  Government agent) and a colossally wily gun dealer named Ordell Robbie. Among the best news about the film is that Samuel L. Jackson's role is even splashier than the one he had in ''Pulp Fiction'' and that his performance is even more of a treat.  The film more than justifies its long, happy stretches of simply watching Ordell work his scams on the unsuspecting, whose number most certainly does not include Max Cherry. 
Max (played by Robert Forster, a wonderfully strong presence here) is a bail bondsman who will eventually develop a soft spot for Jackie, which manifests itself as a taste for old Delfonics songs. But on the job, completely unruffled, Max gives the appearance of having seen everything, even an operator as cold-blooded as Ordell. 
Ordell, whose look is priceless (slick ponytail, tiny needle-shaped goatee) even if his frequent racial references overwork the homeboy pretensions of Mr. Tarantino's screenplay, begins the story with a clear confidence in his ability to outsmart everyone, Jackie included.  Then Ordell begins realizing he may be overmatched. 
Though the film waits an hour and a half to put Ms. Grier into a red dress and let her start strutting, she finally delivers the same kind of payoff for which she was once so famous, delivering the no-nonsense comeuppance to anyone who dares to annoy her. In one early scene, Mr. Tarantino has great directorial fun showing the audience how Jackie got hold of a gun and just how coolly she can brandish it. 
The audience can thus root for Jackie to play off the film's other characters against one another, and can speculate on the whereabouts of a bag full of money that is pivotal to the plot. But beyond that there isn't anything special at stake in ''Jackie Brown,'' and Mr. Tarantino allows the plotting to grow so knotty that it loses interest. The film is best (and most patiently) enjoyed as a set of laid-back sketches that don't always head anywhere, even if a filmmaker of Mr. Tarantino's talents can make schmoozing such an end in itself. 
Bridget Fonda, as the laziest and most sullen of Ordell's girlfriends, spends much of the film lounging woozily on a sofa, even though Ordell says this will rob her of ambition.  ''Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV,'' she replies. 
Also contributing notably to the film's ensemble loafing is Robert De Niro as a stumblebum ex-con who serves as Ordell's henchman, even if he sometimes seems baffled by the boss's business methods. 
''Who's that?'' Mr. De Niro's Louis Gara asks about a corpse in a car trunk. 
''That's Beaumont,'' Ordell replies. 
''Who's Beaumont?'' Louis wonders. 
''A employee I had to let go,'' Ordell explains. 
There's hardly a scene in ''Jackie Brown'' that doesn't, somewhere within the banal chatter, hide a tough little grace note like that. 
''Jackie Brown'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief sexual situations, wall-to-wall stylized profanity and frequent streetwise use of the word ''nigger'' describing both black and white characters.

‽
‽The Winter Guest‽,‽Phyllida Law and Emma Thompson bear such a remarkable physical resemblance that if you didn't know these wonderful British actresses are actually mother and daughter, you could almost imagine that the same person wearing different makeup and aided by trick photography was playing both their roles in ''The Winter Guest.'' In this solemnly talky film, adapted by Sharman Macdonald (with the director Alan Rickman) from his play, Ms. law and Ms. Thompson are Elspeth and Frances, a mother and her recently widowed daughter who spend a frigid winter day trudging through the bleakly beautiful landscape around a Scottish seaside town. 
It is so cold that even the sea around the village has frozen solid. And the film, with cinematography by Seamus McGarvey, luxuriously drinks in a magnificent desolation that conjures up somber thoughts of mortality and human loss. Frances, a professional photographer, is still grieving over the death from an unidentified illness of her dashing husband, whose pictures crowd the mantelpiece of the roomy cottage she shares with her teen-age son, Alex (Gary Hollywood). When Elspeth arrives uninvited to offer emotional support, Frances is not happy to see her. And half the dialogue during their hike consists of petty bickering over matters like Frances's short, allegedly unalluring haircut. 
A fussy, sentimental exercise in theatrical counterpoint, ''The Winter Guest'' interweaves Elspeth's and Frances's dialogues with simultaneous little dramas in the lives of three other pairs of villagers. Lily (Sheila Reid) and Chloe (Sandra Voe), two elderly women, take a bus to a nearby town to attend a funeral. While Frances is out of the house, her bashful son brings home Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a brash tomboyish new girl in town for his first serious kiss. Meanwhile, Sam (Douglas Murphy) and Tom (Sean Biggerstaff), two pubescent schoolboys, hang out together exchanging bogus sexual lore that prompts Tom to conduct an excruciating experiment involving some fiery ointment. He also saves an abandoned kitten. 
It is easy to see why Mr. Rickman, a talented English actor who personifies a rakish literary worldliness, was drawn to ''The Winter Guest'' as his first directorial feature. With its four pairs of seaside partners seen at various stages of life, the play offers tour-de-force acting opportunities. And the film's verbal pas de deux are so polished and fine-tuned that they go a long way toward camouflaging the creaky portentousness of much of the dialogue. Elspeth, who has a voracious appetite for life despite signs of failing health, looks at her well-creased face in the mirror and remarks that she can't reconcile that face with the fact that inside she is still 17. It's one of the movie's many heavily underlined reflections on youth and age. 
The dramatic tension between Elspeth and Frances hinges on a question that hangs teasingly (and falsely) in the air and is not answered until the film's end: Is Frances planning to leave her grief (and her mother) behind and move to Australia? In an equally false moment, Alex's imminent loss of virginity is suddenly pre-empted by his glancing up at a picture of his father, who seems to be staring at him. The boy explains sheepishly that he thinks his father has been haunting the house. 
As the movie goes along, its stiff upper lip quickly begins to tremble and then to flutter. By the end, it has degenerated into an unabashedly mushy assertion of ties of need that bind us together. Somehow those ties make everybody in the movie bizarrely oblivious of the climate. If it is the coldest day of the year, why is no one wearing gloves, a hat or ear covering? And why does no one's breath come out white in the freezing air? Could it be those hot salty tears that the characters are just barely able to suppress have created a freakish momentary thaw? 
''The Winter Guest'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains sexual situations and some profanity.

‽
‽Titanic‽,‽The long-awaited advent of the most expensive movie ever made, the reportedly $200 million ''Titanic,'' brings history to mind, and not just the legendary seafaring disaster of April 15, 1912. Think back also, exactly 58 years ago today, to the Dec. 19 New York premiere of another grand, transporting love story set against a backdrop of prideful excess, cataclysmic upheaval and character-defining trial by fire. 
Recall how that cultural landmark wowed audiences with its bravado, mad extravagance and state-of-the-art Hollywood showmanship, all fueled by one unstoppable filmmaker and his obsessive imagination.  Just as David O. Selznick had Atlanta to burn, now James Cameron has a ship to sink, but he also has much more than calamity to explore in this gloriously retrograde new epic. Mr. Cameron's magnificent ''Titanic'' is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to ''Gone With the Wind.'' 
What a rarity that makes it in today's world of meaningless gimmicks and short attention spans: a huge, thrilling three-and-a-quarter-hour experience that unerringly lures viewers into the beauty and heartbreak of its lost world. Astonishing technological advances are at work here, but only in the service of one spectacular illusion: that the ship is afloat again, and that the audience is intimately involved in its voyage. 
What's more, Mr. Cameron succeeds magically in linking his film's young lovers, played enchantingly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, with established details of the ''Titanic'' story. And let's not forget the offscreen drama: delayed release and outrageous costs made ''Titanic'' the joke of the summer. Now it's the movie of the year. 
Though the tender moments in Mr. Cameron's earlier films have mostly involved Arnold Schwarzenegger, graceful storytelling from this one-man army of a filmmaker (a director, a producer, a writer and an  editor) is the biggest of many surprises here. Swept away by the romance of his subject matter, Mr. Cameron rises to the occasion with a simple, captivating narrative style, one that cares little for subtlety but overflows with wonderful, well-chosen Hollywood hokum. In its own sobering way, the film is forward-looking, too, as its early brashness gives way to near-religious humility when the moments of reckoning arrive. Ultimately a haunting tale of human nature, with endless displays of callousness, gallantry or cowardice, it offers an unforgettable vision of millennium-ready unease in the sight of passengers adrift in icy seas on that last, moonless night. 
That Mr. Cameron allowed flashlights into what should have been a pitch-black sequence is one of the rare times when ''Titanic'' willingly departs from established fact. Otherwise, with an attention to detail that goes well beyond fanatical, the film flawlessly recreates its monument to Gilded Age excess. Behind-the-scenes details here, which prove no less fascinating than Selznick's ''Gone With the Wind'' memos, include Mr. Cameron's having persuaded the original carpet manufacturer to make an 18,000-square-foot reproduction of its ''Titanic'' weave and his having insisted that every sign, uniform and logo for the Southampton sailing sequence also be created in mirror image, so that the camera could reverse the apparent direction of the nearly life-size model ship. 
Sets match old photographs right down to the sculpture and woodwork; costumes incorporate fragments of vintage clothing; even the silver White Star Line ashtrays had to be right. A core group of 150 extras worked with an Edwardian etiquette coach throughout the filming, furthering the illusion that the privileged past had returned to life. 
''Titanic'' is no museum piece, however. It's a film with tremendous momentum right from its deceptive, crass-looking start. The story opens in the present day, with a team of scientist-cowboys (led by Bill Paxton) hunting for lost treasure amid the Titanic wreckage. Though Mr. Cameron made his own journey to the ocean floor to film amazing glimpses of the ship, he treats these explorers as glib 90's hotshots, the kind of macho daredevils who could just as easily be found tracking twisters or dinosaurs in a summer action film. 
''Oops, somebody left the water running,'' one of them wisecracks about the sunken ship. 
Then the film begins, ever so teasingly, to open its window to the past.  A 101-year-old woman (played spiritedly by Gloria Stuart, an 87-year-old beauty who appeared in ''Gold Diggers of 1935'') hears of the expedition and says it has links to her own history. It seems that she, Rose, was the model for a nude sketch found by the present-day fortune hunters in a Titanic safe. It is the only thing of value to be retrieved there. The money in the safe has turned to mud. 
But where is the Heart of the Ocean, the egg-size blue diamond Rose wears in the drawing? Rose begins telling her story, and at long last 1912 is at hand. In an introductory sequence mounted on a colossal scale, Mr. Cameron shows the ship being boarded by its full economic range of passengers, from the haughty rich to the third-class passengers being checked for head lice. 
Young Rose (Ms. Winslet) arrives at the dock in the show-stopping plumage of Deborah L. Scott's costume designs, and in the unfortunate company of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), the tiresome snob whom she has agreed to marry, largely at the urging of her impecunious mother (Frances Fisher). The Rose-Cal story line, which is the weakest part of the film thanks to Cal's unwavering odiousness, plays like Edith  Wharton Lite. 
Meanwhile, in a nearby tavern, adorable Jack Dawson (Mr. DiCaprio) is winning a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game. It won't be long before Jack is bounding happily into steerage, showing off the boyish adventurousness that makes him such a cure for what's ailing Rose.  Aboard the ship of dreams, as the Titanic is often called here, Jack is one serious dreamboat. 
A bohemian artist (whose drawings were done by Mr. Cameron) who has spent the requisite time in Paris, he offers all the fun and flirtatiousness that Rose has been missing. This 20-year-old has also shown his share of worldly wisdom by the end of the story. It goes without saying that it's Jack, not Cal, who is the film's true gentleman. And that Mr. DiCaprio has made an inspired career move in so successfully meeting the biggest challenge for an actor of his generation: a traditional role. 
Among the many miracles of ''Titanic'' is its way of creating a sweet, life-changing courtship between Jack and Rose in the course of only a few days. At the risk of turning into a women's picture, ''Titanic'' brings these two together through a dramatic meeting, an invitation for Jack at a formal first-class dinner, a dancing romp among steerage passengers and even enough intimate moments to give the love story heat.  Splendid chemistry between the stars, along with much color from the supporting cast and careful foreshadowing from Mr. Cameron, keeps the romance buoyant even after the dread iceberg gets in its way. 
Comfortable even in suggesting that the ship's lookouts missed the danger because they were busy watching lovestruck Jack and Rose, Mr. Cameron lets tragedy strike midway through the film. That way, the disaster can unfold in almost real time, with terrifying precision on a par with all the other details here. 
Not for ''Titanic'' the shrill hysteria of ordinary disaster stories; this film is especially delicate in its slow way of letting the gravity of the situation become clear. Much scarier than any explosion-filled caper film is the simple assessment from the ship's master builder, played with great dignity by Victor Garber:  ''In an hour or so, all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.'' 
As Mr. Cameron joked during production, about a film that pitilessly observes the different plights of the rich and the poor, ''We're holding just short of Marxist dogma.'' (A lavish ''Titanic'' coffee table book from HarperCollins is filled with fascinating data about the film, from the director's casual asides to accounts of the technological wizardry, like computerized hydraulics, that were devised for repeatedly sinking the ship.) By this point, the audience knows the ship so fully, from Cal and Rose's elaborate suite to the depths of the boiler room, that the film is on shockingly familiar territory as Rose searches every newly waterlogged area for Jack. 
Very much to Mr. Cameron's credit is the lack of logistical confusion.  Indeed, the film's modern-day characters even watch a computerized version of how the ship split and then rose vertically just before it plunged straight down, events that are later re-enacted with awesome power. Despite all this advance information and the revelation that Rose lives to be 101, ''Titanic'' still sustains an extraordinary degree of suspense. 
Tiny, devastating touches -- how the same doll whose face rests on the ocean floor in 1996 is clutched in the arms of a pretty little girl who idolizes Jack, or a four-hanky coda seen in Rose's dream -- work as well as the film's big spectacle in giving the tragedy of ''Titanic'' its full dramatic impact. Though many of the story's minor characters are one-note (hardly the case with Kathy Bates's hearty Molly Brown or Bernard Hill's brave captain), the cumulative effect of their presence is anything but shallow. 
Beyond its romance, ''Titanic'' offers an indelibly wrenching story of blind arrogance and its terrible consequences. It's the rare Hollywood adventure film that brings mythic images of tragedy -- the fall of Icarus, the ruin of Ozymandias -- so easily to mind. 
The irony is that Mr. Cameron's ''Titanic'' is such a Titanic in its own right, a presumptuous reach for greatness against all reasonable odds. The film itself gambles everything on visual splendor and technological accomplishment, which is one reason its extravagance is fully justified on screen. But if Mr. Cameron's own brazenness echoes that seen in his story, remember the essential difference. This ''Titanic'' is too good to sink. 
''Titanic'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes partial nudity, one brief sexual situation, mild profanity and the soul-shaking sight of a great ship going down.

‽Tomorrow Never Dies‽,‽No need to feel badly if the right watch, drink, cell phone, etc., don't turn you into James Bond. They don't really do it for Pierce Brosnan in ''Tomorrow Never Dies,'' either. Despite Mr. Brosnan's best efforts to be lethally debonair, the Bond franchise has sacrificed most of what made this character unique in the first place, turning the world's suavest spy into one more pitchman and fashion plate. This latest film is such a generic action event that it could be any old summer blockbuster, except  that its hero is chronically overdressed. 
This is not to say that ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' won't be an international success like ''Goldeneye,'' which wasn't much better. But it should fare best in corners of the world where nobody knows how little the title means, or how accurately it reflects the rest of the film's shallowness. Closer than ever to cartoon superhero status, Bond is seen battling ridiculous odds, dodging computer-generated explosions, delivering lame bon mots and boasting pitifully about his sexual prowess. All that gives this an up-to-date sensibility is the audience's awareness that  M (Judi Dench) and Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) could sue him for sexual harassment on the basis of his small talk. 
This film does have a lively villain in Jonathan Pryce, as a media mogul who dreams of everything from manufacturing his own war to marketing software with bugs (so that customers will have to upgrade for years). Mr. Pryce reigns mischievously over an empire that Bond must infiltrate, and he also has a wife (Teri Hatcher) who is one of Bond's approximately one million ex-flames. Ms. Hatcher, like Mr. Brosnan, speaks in a perfect monotone, and so does Michelle Yeoh, the Hong Kong action star who is meant to kick some life into the series. 
The film's other attempts to show Bond in a romantic light are so hopeless that it's a lucky thing his partnership with Ms. Yeoh's character, the svelte and athletic Wai Lin, stays confined to toylike weaponry and flat double-entendres. 
''And now a word from our sponsor,'' muttered the critic beside me,  as the camera offered a good look at James Bond's vodka bottle midway through the so-called story. (The humor-free screenplay is by Bruce Feirstein, author of ''Real Men Don't Eat Quiche'' as well as ''Goldeneye.''  The workmanlike director is Roger Spottiswoode.) Indeed, despite  Bond's mission to defeat the evil mogul, product plugs are the film's most serious business, especially since the audience may be bored enough to start looking at labels. 
The film's two best supporting turns come from Vincent Schiavelli, who has a cheerfully outrageous scene as a torture expert, and from a nice, smart BMW that works on remote control. Hiding in the back seat, Bond pilots the car through a tire-screeching chase. Don't try this at home. 
''Tomorrow Never Dies'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence a la videogames, smirky innuendoes and a couple of brief sexual situations.

‽Will It Snow for Christmas?‽,‽Isn't it amazing how children with few material advantages instinctively devise clever ways to amuse themselves? When they're not slaving under the thumb of their autocratic father on his vegetable farm in the south of France, seven illegitimate children find time to race homemade toy sailboats along the farm's irrigation ditches. Or, using teaspoons and a marble, they play a fast and furious variation of table tennis without a net. 
The accumulation of such intimate familial detail in ''Will It Snow for Christmas?'' gives Sandrine Veysset's moving French film, which won the Cesar (the French Oscar) for best debut film of 1996, a remarkable textural richness. 
The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, transports you to a hardscrabble world of outdoor work and simple pleasures (the farmhouse lacks plumbing and central heating), where the bedtime stories a mother tells her children acquire a mythic resonance. 
As the family and hired hands are shown frantically harvesting everything from parsley to lettuce to leeks, you get a powerful feel for the rhythms and the pressures of farm life, the passing of the seasons and the tyranny and beauty of the ever-changing climate. 
For all the movie's celebration of childhood wonder, ''Will It Snow for Christmas?'' is anything but sentimental. A level-headed, almost neo-realist film, it conveys a grim undercurrent of despair as it observes the children's emotionally abused, overworked mother (Dominique Reymond) doing the work of three and trying to be a loving parent to her brood. As she exhaustedly dispenses goodnight kisses to her children, each of whom has an animal nickname, you feel the depth and tenacity of her love but also the effort of will it takes to express it under such conditions. 
It is for survival as much as anything that the mother stays with the father (Daniel Duval), who lives most of the time with his wife and ''legitimate'' family in a nearby town. For better or worse, there is a certain security in indentured servitude. 
And as the movie makes clear in a bedroom scene between the couple, beneath the father's tyranny and abuse lurks a grudging tenderness toward the woman who gave him seven offspring. 
The father may be a manipulative bully, but he is not quite a monster.  He demeans the mother as a whore and regularly reminds the children that they are illegitimate, but his iron rule also holds their lives together in its practical way. Even when the father, an inveterate womanizer, makes a pass at his oldest daughter, the movie treats the incident with minimal hysteria. It's just one more selfish, impulsive power play to add  to his list of abuses. 
''Will It Snow for Christmas?,'' which was filmed over several months, begins in the summer and ends on Christmas Eve with the mother telling her children a personal story that has acquired the resonance of a fairy tale. Recounting a dream she had when she was 16, the mother tells of meeting God, who orders her to run a race with a fat woman who seems easily beatable. When the fat woman unexpectedly speeds to victory, the mother is told her punishment: she will have seven children. 
Far from feeling unwanted, the children accept the story as a miraculous fable that makes them special. The story underlines the profound ambiguity at the heart of this beautiful film. The mother, beautifully played by Ms. Reymond in various shades of torment, resignation and embattled passion, has created something close to heaven (a bucolic familial idyll) while living in a kind of hell. The two kingdoms are inseparable. 
WILL IT SNOW FOR CHRISTMAS? 
Written (in French, with English subtitles) and directed by Sandrine Veysset; director of photography, Helene Louvart; edited by Nelly Quettier; production designer, Jacque Dubus; produced by Humbert Balsan; released by Zeitgeist Films. At the Film Forum, 209 Houston Street, South Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not rated.

‽Scream 2‽,‽It looks as if the ''Scream'' franchise has staying power. In fact, the sneaky ''Scream 2'' has so much tongue-in-cheek trickery that it virtually escapes the horror genre, the one it so happily lampoons. This ''Scream,'' once again directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, almost works as straight satire. It's so sharp -- pardon the expression -- that no pretty young things absolutely had to die. 
Well, O.K., maybe just one. The opening slaughter of a high-profile actress has become a standard feature, and this time Jada Pinkett does the honors. The film announces its fun house quality by sending her to the movies with a date (Omar Epps) to see ''Stab,'' a fictionalized version of ''Scream,'' which was fiction to begin with. But who's on first, anyhow? The audience for Mr. Craven's sequel is invited to enter a hall of mirrors and stay there, even watching characters in a sequel argue about whether sequels are any good.  Not for nothing does one of the later fatal stalkings take place at film school. 
At the ''Stab'' screening, where fans run amok in the Munch-inspired ''Scream'' costume and a party atmosphere prevails, Ms. Pinkett establishes this film's modus operandi for short-circuiting criticism. Ms. Pinkett, a black actress with a standout role in ''Scream 2,'' is heard complaining about the lily whiteness of the usual horror film cast. And the giddiness of ''Stab'' fans suggests that horror needn't be taken too seriously. Later on there are equally offhanded references to ''all the violence-in-cinema issues,'' even though those issues remain alive and well here. Joking about something doesn't make it go away. 
Still, while ''Scream 2'' manages to leave most of its cast unavailable for ''Scream 3,'' it keeps the gruesomeness on a back burner. (Speaking of which, ''Stab'' even immortalizes the first film's smoking Jiffy  Pop, the one left on the kitchen stove by Drew Barrymore.) There is less emphasis on senseless murder than on the profits it can bring, at least in the media circus that now envelops the surviving ''Scream'' characters.  Courteney Cox's Gale Weathers, the television reporter who has grown even more hard-boiled than she used to be, is now a best-selling author. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), wrongly jailed in the first film, now wants 10 minutes' worth of national television time as reparations. And Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the series' intrepid heroine, has lived to see herself played by Tori Spelling onscreen. 
Despite a different venue, so that the new film follows Sidney to leafy Windsor College in the Midwest, not all that much has changed. Somebody is still making whispery phone calls to people that he, she or they plan to kill. (''What's your favorite scary movie?'' somebody asks here, echoing the killer's question. This time the answer is ''Showgirls.'')  The victims are still cute and not too smart about staying home alone.  And college gives the killer a chance to raid sorority houses, which the filmmakers have fun decimating in their own way. ''No, I really mean it,'' says one sorority sister. ''Hi!'' 
The cast still includes Jamie Kennedy as Randy, its resident geek, and David Arquette as Dewey Riley, its traveling one. (Dewey, the film's goofiest character, comes from California to help Sidney fend off a ''Stab''-inspired copycat killer.) New this time are Elise Neal as Sidney's roommate, Duane Martin as Gale's scaredy-cat cameraman, Laurie Metcalf as a dowdy local reporter and assorted campus types. These range from the film professor who ends class by saying ''That'll be a wrap'' to the guy (Jerry O'Connell) who manages to imitate Tom Cruise and David Cassidy simultaneously, thanks to a ''Top Gun'' homage. Even if you haven't spent as much obsessive time at the video store as these guys have, you might enjoy helping ''Scream 2'' laugh all the way to the bank. 
''Scream 2'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes moderately messy stabbings, skewerings, etc., as well as occasional profanity. There are no sexual situations and notably less leering this time around.

‽
‽Hugo Pool‽,‽With ''Hugo Pool,'' a whimsical stylistic throwback to those psychedelic days of yesteryear, Robert Downey, whose free-for-all spoofs ''Putney Swope'' and ''Greaser's Palace'' gained a certain cachet in hippie circles, has returned to filmmaking. And although this flighty comic allegory about love and death in contemporary Los Angeles is wildly overacted, with loose ends flying everywhere, it still conveys an antic poignancy. 
The central character, Floyd Gaylen (Patrick Dempsey), is a beautiful young man of saintly disposition, suffering from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), who accompanies the movie's title character (Alyssa Milano), an intrepid swimming pool cleaner, on her daily rounds through some of the posher neighborhoods of Los Angeles during a drought. By the end of the day they've fallen in love. And the film, which bites its lip until the final scenes, figuratively bursts into tears. 
Around this story, written by Mr. Downey with his wife, Laura, who died of ALS three years ago at 36, the filmmaker has constructed a zany seat-of-your-pants spoof of Hollywood narcissists and familial dysfunction. Hugo's brassy mother, Minerva (Cathy Moriarty), is a compulsive gambler whose sole pleasure is playing the horses. And when Floyd, who can only speak through a computer, drops the name of a horse that is running that day, Minerva becomes obsessed with the certainty that it's a winner. 
Hugo's loony white-haired father, Henry (Malcolm McDowell), an alcoholic who babbles on about his addiction to ''ring dang do,'' is dispatched by Hugo in her water truck to the Colorado River to bring back an illicit load to fill up the empty pool of a gangster named Chic Chicalini (Richard Lewis), who is throwing a party that evening. Joining Henry on the journey is an extremely laconic leprechaun (Sean Penn), whose bright blue shoes Henry covets. 
Hugo's eccentric customers include a bored Los Angeles matron who pays a handsome lifeguard to save her and deliver mouth-to-mouth resusciation when she ''accidentally'' falls into her pool, and a egomaniacal Dutch movie director named Franz (Robert Downey Jr.) who in a fit of temperament has shot and killed one of his extras. 
The film's central love story and its comic embellishments feel forced together, because the movie's performances are so jarringly out of tune. Mr. McDowell, Mr. Lewis and Robert Downey Jr. are gratingly garish caricatures, and Mr. Penn seems almost to be sleepwalking through his thankless, and inexplicable, role. 
But Ms. Milano and Mr. Dempsey  are clear and understated and give the film its heart. And when the movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinemas, concentrates on the details of caring for an ALS patient who is barely able to move or speak, it suddenly snaps to attention. All the peripheral nonsense fades away, and you feel for the brave soul who, despite his inability to talk and be sensate in the most basic ways, maintains an open heart.

‽
‽Home Alone 3‽,‽It was a shrewd studio executive who decided that the ''Home Alone'' series didn't require the towheaded, hooded-eyed screen presence of Macaulay Culkin to stay alive and kicking. As ''Home Alone 3'' vigorously demonstrates, all the franchise really needs to keep going is a charismatic child (Alex D. Linz has replaced Mr. Culkin) with no great acting skills but loads of pseudo-innocent chubby-cheeked adorability. 
Put sophisticated remote-control gadgetry at the boy's fingertips, and get a director (the newcomer Raja Gosnell) with a feel for the kind of knockabout farce that makes grown-ups look like fools, and you have a refreshed formula that's good for at least one more episode and maybe two. Providing crucial continuity is John Hughes, who masterminded the first two ''Home Alones'' and is co-producer and writer for Part 3. 
''Home Alone 3'' is essentially a good-natured repeat of the blockbuster original, but with a different all-American family (the Pruitts have replaced the McCallisters) in  an upscale Chicago suburb. Its hero, 8-year-old Alex Pruitt (Mr. Linz), the youngest of the three Pruitt children, is a mechanical whiz of infinite resourcefulness and indefatigable self-confidence. 
While his family is out of the house, Alex fortifies the place with so many potentially lethal booby traps that an intruder unlucky enough to force his way in will find himself plunged into a zany chamber of horrors. Even the family pets, a white mouse named Doris (whom Alex enjoys scaring by showing her a neighbor's cat through his telescope) and a loudmouthed parrot that can light matches, get into the act. 
The invaders -- who inspire Alex to do things like place what only appears to be a trampoline over a camouflaged, snow-filled swimming pool into which the villains eventually fling themselves from an attic window -- are four bumbling international gangsters who have got their hands on an Air Force computer chip that makes missiles undetectable and are planning to sell it to North Korean terrorists. Through a baggage mix-up at the San Francisco airport, the chip, which has been hidden in a toy car known as the Mutator, ends up winging its way to Chicago and into Alex's bedroom. 
Descending upon the community, wearing silly disguises and armed with enough surveillance and safe-cracking equipment to gratify the most technologically fetishistic fan of ''Mission: Impossible,'' the bad guys are unable to determine exactly where the toy landed and resort to systematically burglarizing the homes in Alex's neighborhood to find it. Scanning the area with his telescope while his parents are out, the boy, who is home with the chicken pox, twice observes a burglary in progress and reports it to the police. 
Both times, the criminals escape before the police arrive, and Alex is lectured sternly about turning in false alarms. Adult disbelief makes the child all the more determined to catch the culprits and clear his good name. 
In the movie's cleverest sequence, he equips the Mutator with a video camera and sends it bouncing across the street into a neighbor's house to photograph the criminals. In the funny extended chase sequence that ensues, the adroitly deployed vehicle tricks the gangsters into doing one uproarious pratfall after another, as they try to retrieve the apparently indestructible toy, which has the miraculous ability to leap over high fences. As in the original ''Home Alone,'' the combat turns more brutal once the criminals enter the Pruitt home and find themselves besieged by an astounding array of mechanical contraptions, several of them built like fancy slingshots. 
The difference between ''Home Alone 3'' and its predecessors is largely a matter of tone. Where Mr. Culkin seemed to take a sadistic, poker-faced glee in the injuries he inflicted, Mr. Linz expresses the more innocent delight of a child caught up in an action-packed Saturday morning cartoon. 
Behind the villains' comic grimaces, there's no real pain. Care has been taken to make the mechanics behind each prank appear as elaborately silly as a Rube Goldberg contraption. And in making the villains (Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny Von Dohlen, and David Thornton) buffoonish caricatures of television spies, the movie deftly spoofs a technological mystique that Alex's ingenious homemade defenses puncture again and again. 
In doing so, the movie exploits the generation gap in technological know-how between today's computer-wise whiz kids and their parents. In making Alex such a mechanical marvel, the movie strokes children's fantasies of remote-control omnipotence while reassuring working parents that their children, equipped with the latest in telecommunications gadgetry, will be resourceful enough to amuse themselves and, if necessary, ward off danger when they are not around. 
''Home Alone 3'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The punishments meted out to the villains are funny, but many of them are also cruel. 
HOME ALONE 3

‽
‽Amistad‽,‽Midway through Steven Spielberg's ''Amistad'' and its long-overlooked story of a slave-ship mutiny and subsequent trial, the film finally presents the experience of captivity from the viewpoint of its main African character. He is the leader of this rebellion, the fierce figure who became known as Cinque. (His African name was Sengbe Pieh.) 
This somber-hued film erupts into lush color for a glimpse of Cinque's wife and child in their peaceful village, and sees him gaze warmly at their backs as they walk away from him forever. Then, with no warning, Cinque is ambushed and captured, destined to be sent halfway around the world. Viewers wishing to avoid waterworks can only be grateful that Mr. Spielberg denies the wife and child a backward glance. 
Power in Hollywood: a tired subject if ever there was one, but ''Amistad'' demonstrates what it really means. It's the ability to use images like this flashback, and like the stark, agonizing depiction of the captives' Atlantic crossing right afterward, to create the full empathy and immediacy this subject matter deserves. It's the creative means to bring any experience home to an audience, whether it comes from a faraway planet or from our underexplored past. It's the ability to make a $75 million holiday movie about a shameful chapter in American history simply because one thinks that's the right thing to do. 
Thus the worthiness of ''Amistad'' is irrefutable, as are its credentials despite the current legal uproar over source material. After all, this is a film featuring a cameo appearance by a former Justice of the Supreme Court (Harry A. Blackmun, seen briefly as the Justice rendering an 1841 decision). It has excellent cinematography (by Janusz Kaminski) with an avowed debt to Goya. It had Dr. Clifton Johnson, creator of the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University in New Orleans, to advise the filmmakers on African tribal life and translate portions of dialogue into the Mende dialect. It has two Academy Award nominees (one a winner) cast as American Presidents. Its authenticity is so earnest that it has real African actors shackled in real chains. 
But what the estimable ''Amistad'' does not have is an Oskar Schindler. It has no three-dimensional major character through whose flawed human nature an unimaginable atrocity can be understood. Dwarfed by the enormity of what it means to illustrate, the diffuse ''Amistad'' divides its energies among many concerns: the pain and strangeness of the captives'  experience, the Presidential election in which they become a factor, the stirrings of civil war, and the great many bewhiskered abolitionists and legal representatives who argue about their fate. The specific, as in Cinque's being torn from his family, is overwhelmed by generality. And this is a film in which John Quincy Adams, played by Anthony Hopkins as a wise old curmudgeon faithfully devoted to his houseplants, is the zestiest character by far. 
''Amistad'' dares to begin on a mythic note, starting with furious images of shipboard mutiny. Lurid as this is, it soon gives way to the more straightforward storytelling that Mr. Spielberg handles with greater ease. En route, the captives rebel and take control of the Spanish ship that is outrageously named La Amistad (Friendship), hoping to return home to Africa. 
Instead, they are tricked into unfriendly waters. Mr. Spielberg illustrates this handily with a passing vessel carrying genteel partygoers and musicians, to the Africans' astonishment. When the Amistad approaches what is supposed to be African coastline, a man riding a bicycle comes into view. 
Jailed in New England and put on trial, the Africans remain a mostly undifferentiated group except for Cinque. A language barrier also separates them from much of the film's main action, although the Steven Spielberg of ''E.T.'' knows winsome ways of showing what it means to be a stranger. 
The Africans are baffled by the hymn singing of grim abolitionists, whom they mistake for bad entertainers. They are also horrified by Matthew McConaughey, as a lawyer whom they call Dung Scraper, and the audience may not react much more kindly. Amiable matinee idol that he is, Mr. McConaughey should cease and desist from affecting mannerisms from previous centuries or playing any more smart lawyers. 
With Stellan Skarsgard and the seriously underused Morgan Freeman as top-hatted abolitionists, Anna Paquin as the giddy 11-year-old Spanish Queen who claims the Africans as her property, David Paymer as a Secretary of State, Pete Postlethwaite as the Government prosecutor making a case against the Africans and Nigel Hawthorne as President Martin Van Buren, ''Amistad'' has many an occasion for speeches and bons mots. But none of the rhetoric, not even the oratorical heights reached when John Quincy Adams takes on the Supreme Court, can compare with the Africans' story. And the best parts of ''Amistad'' are those that simply bring their pride, fear and outrage to life. 
As Cinque, the former model (and performer in Madonna and Janet Jackson videos) Djimon Hounsou gives the film a strong visual focus as he radiates extraordinary presence and fury. If all that he, Mr. Spielberg and ''Amistad'' accomplish is to secure for this story its place in history classrooms, that would suffice. Mr. Hounsou also acts his role quite movingly within the narrow confines of the screenplay credited to David Franzoni, a script whose fine points are now a matter of dispute. 
At least one point of contention, the helpful rapport that develops between Cinque and Adams, seems entirely organic to the movie. It doesn't take Barbara Chase-Riboud, the historical novelist who has accused the filmmakers of plagiarism, to see the storytelling value of letting these two opposites attract. 
''Amistad'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes necessary violence and brief nudity in its tough, sobering depictions of the captives' ordeal.

‽Mysteries of Egypt‽,‽Directed by Bruce Niebaur 
Not rated, 45 minutes 
''Mysteries of Egypt,'' a new Imax film produced in cooperation with National Geographic, is a convenient substitute for a trip to the country itself and a nice supplement to a visit to the mummy collection in your local museum. The five-story screen and the swooping aerial camera work convey the grandeur and majesty of the pyramids of Giza and the gigantic statues at Abu Simbel. And if the experience still does not quite match standing at the foot of the monuments themselves, it is also free of desert heat, souvenir hawkers and tour-bus exhaust. The sphinx and the pyramids seem to exist in a vast and timeless desert. The nearby Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise is nowhere to be seen. 
After a thrilling bird's-eye trip up the Nile, we settle into a Cairo cafe to learn about the most famous dead Egyptian -- the boy king Tutankhamen -- from one of his most famous living countrymen, Omar Sharif. Mr. Sharif, whose suave and civilized voice adds greatly to the film's charm, plays a Cairene instructing his American granddaughter (Kate Maberly) about the marvels of the ancient world and about Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the tombful of those marvels that had been sealed away for millenniums. 
Audiences are likely to be captivated by the lavish photography. How much they are engrossed by the content will likely depend on how much they already know. Like dinosaurs, which are similarly well-served by the big Imax screen, ancient Egypt is a subject of endless fascination for school-age children. This means that many of them will arrive at ''Mysteries of Egypt,'' which opens today at the Imax Theater at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street), with a certain dogmatic expertise, and may find the information it contains elementary and patronizingly presented. 
On the other hand this concise, sweeping survey of 4,000 years of civilization may attract a new generation of budding Egyptologists, much in the way that the ''Treasures of Tutankhamen'' exhibition did a generation ago. And young viewers seduced by the trashy flash of ''The Mummy'' and ''The Mummy Returns'' will be able to glimpse a vanished reality richer, stranger and bigger than all of the special effects in Hollywood.

‽Scrapple‽,‽Christopher Hanson's ''Scrapple'' is a completely uncondescending, nearly letter-perfect re-creation of a late 60's-early 70's stoner comedy. As such, it's a very strange cultural artifact, though not an unappealing one. It opens today for an exclusive run at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village. 
In reproducing the rambling tone, scruffy stylistics and laid-back attitude of such hazily if fondly remembered titles as Arthur Penn's ''Alice's Restaurant'' (1969) or Paul Williams's ''Dealing: Or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues'' (1972, from an early novel by Michael Crichton), Mr. Hanson has brought off an artistic stunt on the level of reconstructing Red Square out of toothpicks or building a Lego version of the Mona Lisa. 
The effort itself is so impressive that it eclipses any qualms one might have about the point of undertaking the exercise in the first place. Filming on location in and around the now uber-chic ski resort of Telluride, Colo., Mr. Hanson succeeds amazingly well in turning the clock back 30 years, to a time when Telluride (appearing here under the pseudonym of Ajax) was a remote outpost populated by ski bums, substance abusers and a few prescient real estate developers. 
Geoffrey Hanson, the director's brother as well as the movie's co-producer and one of its writers, stars as Al Dean, a bumbling, low-level pot dealer looking forward to a shipment of Nepalese Temple Balls (wads of hashish chewed by monks high in the Himalayas). Al hopes that the profits from his sales will allow him to buy a rundown house on Ajax's main street, where he'll be able to move with his disabled brother. (In the film's one hint of politics, Mr. Hanson suggests that the brother, confined to a V.A. hospital, is a Vietnam veteran.) 
Mr. Hanson contrasts the relatively pro-active Al with the utterly reactive Tom Sullivan (Buck Simmonds), a drifter who has never recovered from the death of his girlfriend in a skiing accident. Although Beth Muller (Ryan Massey), the local singer-songwriter, has taken more than a sisterly interest in him, Tom is still in a perpetual fugue state, hallucinating his ex's presence at inconvenient moments (when he wakes up with Beth, for instance) and doing his best to avoid commitment. 
The film's third focus of interest is the title character, a pig of ambiguous status -- pet or dinner? -- being raised by an Australian bartender (Bunzy Bunworth). The action, such as it is, is touched off when Scrapple devours Al's stock, forcing Al into an unholy alliance with a real estate agent (L. Kent Brown) whose real business is dealing cocaine. 
There is perhaps a metaphor here. Still, Mr. Hanson seems less interested in editorializing than in depicting lazy good times, like the half-hearted softball games that occasionally united the community, or the rock-climbing and motorcycle-riding expeditions that punctuate the plot for no particular dramatic reason. Even an unexpectedly violent denouement fails to disrupt the film's nostalgic vibe.

‽The Well‽,‽The first half of ''The Well,'' the Australian director Samantha Lang's beautifully creepy debut feature, is an efficient study in the contrasting temperaments of two lonely women. Hester (Pamela Rabe), who lives with her father on a desolate sheep station, is the repressed one. We know this because of her long skirts and buttoned-up blouses, her orthopedic shoes and her flat, colorless hair, which she wears either severely plaited or gathered into a bun like the one Anthony Perkins sported in ''Psycho.'' Her taste in music runs to German lieder sung at dirge pace to the accompaniment of an out-of-tune upright piano. 
Katherine (Miranda Otto), her wayward young housekeeper, is the free spirit and resident life force. She loves loud rock music and likes to dance around in knee-high boots and short gauzy skirts. Her flaming red hair is the only splash of color on the dour, Victorian psychic landscape. 
But Hester loves Katherine. Or at least she buys her expensive gifts, excuses her from chores and learns, in her company, how to laugh. Bred in flinty pioneer thrift, Hester begins to spend money as if it were going out of style. She buys a brand-new silver Toyota pickup and, once her father dies, sells her childhood home and everything in it. Hester's disapproving financial adviser (Paul Chubb) suspects that Katherine has bewitched her, but the unlikely pair, along with two cookie tins full of cash, settle into a cozy cottage and begin fantasizing about a trip to Europe. 
Just as you begin to chafe at the obviousness of this setup, or to settle in for another hour of glum psychological atmospherics, Katherine runs over something -- which turns out to be someone -- on a deserted dirt road, and ''The Well,'' with a neck-snapping jolt, turns into the scariest exercise in cinematic sleight of hand since ''The Blair Witch Project.'' Soon there is a body to be disposed of, and the deep, dry well in front of the cottage offers itself as a practical solution and as a metaphor for the murky terror that is about to unfold. 
Katherine begins to insist that the man in the well is alive and that he has fallen in love with her. Surely she's come unhinged. Or maybe Hester, who either believes Katherine or doesn't, has gone over the edge. Or maybe you're the crazy one. Strange things begin to happen, unless nothing is happening at all. The story, adapted by Laura Jones from a novel by Elizabeth Jolley, is like a chain of slipknots, drawing ever tighter until one by one they disappear. 
Ms. Lang brings this puzzle to the screen with mathematical discipline and painterly emotion. She charges the smallest interactions with unbearable tension and knows how to induce panic by suggesting rather than showing. Like Peter Weir in ''Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' she turns the empty, windy outback into an actively sinister presence. 
Stumbling into ''The Well,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, you feel you've awakened into someone else's nightmare, and you emerge from it clammy with a dread you don't quite understand. See it with someone you trust. Or better, see it alone, since afterward you won't be able to trust anything, least of all your own perceptions.

‽All I Wanna Do‽,‽The title of ''All I Wanna Do'' tells you nothing at all about the movie except, by inference, that it's for and about teenagers. Like ''She's All That,'' ''Down to You'' and ''Whatever It Takes,'' this innocuous, intermittently charming coming-of-age comedy has been given a name that refers to nothing at all, evokes no particular associations and is likely to be forgotten shortly after you leave the theater. 
But in this case, the title -- the third, after the more evocative but less marketable ''Strike'' and ''The Hairy Bird'' were scrapped -- seems especially inapt. ''All I Wanna Do,'' which opens today at the U.A. Union Square 14, takes place in 1963 at Miss Godard's, a proper New England boarding school for girls. In this milieu, if the script is to be trusted, young ladies expressed themselves crisply and grammatically, with occasional malapropisms and redundancies (''I loathe and abhor it'') thrown in for effect. 
Conducting this symphony of high diction is Lynn Redgrave as the school's embattled headmistress, whose grimacing upper-crustiness seems to have been learned from studying the accents of the millionaire and his wife on ''Gilligan's Island.'' Miss Godard's is the kind of place where Odette Sinclair (Gaby Hoffmann), newly arrived from Detroit with her horse in tow, soon earns a reputation among her peers for daring verbal wit because she says things like (I'm not kidding) ''up your ziggy with a wah-wah brush.'' 
''All I Wanna Do,'' the first feature directed by Sarah Kernochan, a screenwriter who has worked on such diverse projects as ''9 1/2  Weeks'' and ''Sommersby,'' mixes such prim old-fashioned naughtiness with more consequential misbehavior. Odette, a smart, politically astute young woman, soon joins a proto-feminist consciousness-raising group called the D.A.R. (Daughters of American Ravioli, in honor of the young women's favored snack, which they consume cold, straight from the can.) 
The daughters are the usual melange of teenage girl types: the slut (Monica Keena), the angry rich girl (Kirsten Dunst), the bulimic (Heather Matarazzo) and so on. They dream of becoming magazine editors and scientists, but Odette, who has the talent to become, in the words of one of her chums, ''a speechwriter or a demagogue,'' aspires to be an ''ex-virgin'' instead and enlists her pals in a conspiracy to arrange a clandestine tryst with her boyfriend, Dennis (Matthew Lawrence). 
The 60's arrive just in time. Miss Godard's is about to merge with a boys' school called St. Ambrose, and a faction of the D.A.R. mounts an ingenious (if slightly incredible) plot to preserve the school's identity. The film's politics seem a bit anachronistic, projecting a 1990's feminist critique of co-education onto a time in which ambitious young women were more likely to be agitating for admission to institutions reserved for men. 
But in any case ''All I Wanna Do'' is more fable than history. How else does one explain the presence of a gang of skinny, artsy townies who seem to be hanging around waiting to be cast as extras in the new Beck  video? 
''All I Wanna Do'' lurches between girl-power melodrama and bratty farce, but the ungainliness is part of the film's charm. Adolescence is an awkward time, and so were the 60's, for that matter. It's hard not to be won over by the spirited sloppiness of Ms. Kernochan and her cast, who gamely assay even the most stilted period absurdities of the script. Sometimes you think you're watching a finishing-school remake of ''Animal House,'' at others a made-for-the-WB version of ''The Group.'' 
But the film is surprisingly pleasant, thanks to smart, unstereotyped performances -- especially by Ms. Hoffmann and Ms. Dunst -- and the filmmaker's evident respect and affection for her characters. 
''All I Wanna Do'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some sexual references and situations, a good deal of vomiting (self-induced and otherwise) and the casual display of elaborate, historically accurate foundation garments.

‽Secret Defense‽,‽For nearly three hours, Sandrine Bonnaire grimly mopes through ''Secret Defense,'' the French director Jacques Rivette's dreary contemporary retelling of the Electra myth. Ms. Bonnaire is Sylvie, a dour cancer researcher who is interrupted one day in her laboratory by her emotionally distraught younger brother Paul (Gregoire Colin), who arrives toting a gun. Insisting he has evidence that their father, who ran a guided-missile factory, was murdered by his right-hand man, Walser (Jerzy Radziwilowicz), Paul announces that he intends to avenge the crime. 
Paul is certain that their father, instead of accidentally falling from a moving train, was pushed. As proof, he produces a snapshot found among his father's belongings showing Walser, who claimed to be elsewhere, standing several feet from their father at the station platform shortly before his death. 
The screenplay, written by the director with Pascal Bonitzer and Emmanuelle Cuau, doesn't begin to make the details of the story credible. Yet the movie, which opens today at Anthology Film Archives, is reasonably well acted (Mr. Radziwilowicz's porcine Walser is a weirdly ambiguous semi-villain) and sustains an atmosphere of glum mistrust. 
Sylvie, deciding that her brother is too unstable to carry out the murder, decides to do it herself. And the scenes of the taut, nervous scientist determinedly boarding a series of trains on her way to kill Walser have a hypnotic suspense. Confronting Walser at his lavish country estate with its glowing red interiors, Sylvie draws a gun but is intercepted by his secretary and girlfriend Veronique (Laure Marsac). As the two women wrestle over the weapon, it goes off, accidentally killing Veronique. For the rest of the film -- and it has a long way to go -- Sylvie is so stricken with guilt and fear that she can barely speak. 
Walser, to Sylvie's amazement, disposes of Veronique's body and enlists her as an ally in covering up the death. Complicating matters is the arrival of Sylvie's younger sister Ludivine (Ms. Marsac). Walser's bizarre strategy for allaying Ludivine's possible suspicions is to promptly seduce her. It also develops that Sylvie's mother, Genevieve (Francoise Fabian) might somehow be in cahoots with Walser. But why? Might it have something to do with the death years many earlier of Sylvie's teenage sister Elizabeth? And why are the technicians at a top-secret project in Walser's company walking around in rubber space suits? 
As the glacially paced film inches forward with its halting conversations and accusatory glances, it tests your patience. And when the truth ultimately tumbles out and more violence erupts, don't expect a catharsis.

‽The Day of the Beast‽,‽If Quentin Tarantino had gotten his directorial hands on ''Rosemary's Baby'' or ''The Exorcist,'' the results might very well have resembled ''The Day of the Beast.'' 
Part black comedy, part lurid cartoon, part paranoid theological melodrama with a heavy metal undercurrent, this subtitled Spanish film arrives today at Cinema Village trailing half a dozen Goyas, the Spanish equivalents of Oscars. 
One of them, for best director, honored Alex de la Iglesia, who collaborated with Jorge Guerricaechavarria in writing this hyperthyroid tale of a scholarly priest, Father Angel (Alex Angula), whose studies of the Apocrypha have convinced him that the Antichrist is to be born in Madrid before dawn on Christmas. At its best, ''The Day of the Beast'' is comic in a casually brutal visual way, performed as if it matters, and never allows its swift pace to flag; at its least admirable, it loses its early comic touch and seems to revel in bloody violence that is all too familiar. 
With only hours to spare, in a city where babies have been disappearing, graves have been desecrated and roving bands have been beating and burning the homeless, the priest sets out to make contact with Satan, mortifying his flesh and selling his soul to try to find and kill the infant Antichrist and save humanity before the Devil can appear and establish his dominion. 
To this end, the priest, played by Mr. Angula with a beguiling mixture of wide-eyed innocence and relentless determination, enlists the hulking, shaggy, body-pierced, tattooed Jose Maria (Santiago Segura), the owner of a heavy metal record shop,  and, after some painful persuasian, Professor Cavan (Armando de Razza), a Mephistophelean-looking author and the host of ''The Dark Zone,'' a popular television program devoted to the occult. 
Along the way, in the boarding house owned by Jose Maria's shotgun-packing, cleaver-whacking mama, Rosario (Terele Pavez), the priest encounters her country-girl servant, Mina (Nathalie Sesena) and Rosario's frontally nude, mute father. And the plot calls upon the clergyman to draw blood from the virginal Mina, do in Rosario and suffer various beatings, a shotgun wound that shreds his ear and the music of a band called Satannica in a seething hellish dance club. 
That is not to overlook the capture of Susana (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), Cavan's voluptuous girlfriend; the beating and binding of Cavan, and a hair-raising escape along the side of a skyscraper from an early encounter with the Beast. 
Some of Mr. de la Iglesia's characters rebound like cartoon creatures from the mayhem visited on them; others remain very dead indeed. 
As theological adventures go, the over-the-top ''Day of the Beast'' adds up to a mixed blessing. 
''The Day of the Beast'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It involves bloody violence, nudity and coarse language. 
THE DAY OF THE BEAST 
Directed by Alex de la Iglesia; written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) by Jorge Guerricaechevarria and Mr. de la Iglesia; director of photography, Flavio Martinez Labiano; edited by Teresa Font; music by Battista Lena; produced by Ms. Font; released by Trimark Pictures. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village. Running time: 104 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽Frogs for Snakes‽,‽Quentin Tarantino has already blasted himself a niche in cinema history, but his full impact on the gross national product may not be measurable until the last of his filmmaking disciples has exorcised the demon that impels them to imitate ''Pulp Fiction.'' 
The latest of these bloody black comedies is ''Frogs for Snakes,'' written and directed by Amos Poe. It tells the story of a group of lower Manhattan lowlifes circulating in the malign milieu of a corpulent loan shark who also happens to be a bit of a theatrical impresario. And all of his associates, lovers, ex-lovers, children and their friends yearn seriously to act. 
So here's the joke that is repeated throughout the film: for all of these people, killing or maiming is simply business. What really stirs their blood is the thought that someone else in this circle might get a part they covet or have the gall to choose a monologue in an audition or acting class that they regard as theirs. These are people who would literally kill for a role. 
Mr. Poe has assembled a fine cast, led by Barbara Hershey as Eva, and including people like John Leguizamo, Robbie Coltrane, Justin Theroux, Ron Perlman, Harry Hamlin, Debi Mazar and Lisa Marie. But in the end, after the oral sex monologue and the bouncing shotgunned head and the gallons of blood and the diner that have their ''Pulp Fiction'' counterparts, ''Frogs for Snakes'' remains derivative. 
Although surely not for delicate sensibilities, the film nonetheless maintains a consistent sense of macabre humor and delivers vivid performances. Ms. Hershey as the ex-wife of Al (Mr. Coltrane), the mother of their little boy, a sometime hit woman and occasional waitress, is the best actor of the lot but eager to escape to a better life. ''I don't kill people,'' she says to one of her targets. ''I maim them.'' 
Her determination is intensified after her lover, Zip (Mr. Leguizamo), is gunned down by Al's wheel man, U. B. (David Deblinger), whose zeal is heightened by his desire for a role in Al's next production, David Mamet's ''American Buffalo.'' 
''Frogs for Snakes'' begins intriguingly, but thereafter it is mostly recycled ''Pulp.'' 
''Frogs for Snakes'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains bloody violence, coarse language and simulated sex. 
FROGS FOR SNAKES

‽Testamento‽,‽What if the crucial events of anyone's biography are little more than quirks, accidents, lucky breaks and missed connections? That's the jaunty, absurdist view of existence offered by ''Testamento,'' a colorful, good-natured yarn that examines the life and times of Napumoceno da Silva Araujo (Nelson Xavier), the wealthiest man in Cape Verde. 
As the fictional character tells the story of his life on a series of cassettes bequeathed to his illegitimate daughter, Graca (Maria Ceica), the lucky turning point in his career begins with a clerical error involving a shipment of umbrellas. An aspiring import-export mogul from Cape Verde, the West African archipelago off the coast of Senegal, Araujo decides on a whim to import a thousand umbrellas. Although it hasn't rained for over a year there, he figures that eventually it will, and in any case the umbrellas can be sold for sunshade. 
But when the shipment arrives, thanks to a bumbling secretary's accidental insertion of an extra zero, there are 10,000. Convinced that he is ruined, Araujo begs everyone to pray for rain. Miraculously the heavens open, and a catastrophic deluge engulfs his home city of Mindelo. The umbrellas are quickly sold. Araujo, now suddenly wealthy, is toasted as a far-sighted business genius. 
Never mind that the notion of anyone becoming rich from the sale of 10,000 umbrellas doesn't add up. ''Testamento,'' adapted by Mario Prata from a novel by the Cape Verdean writer Germano Almeida and cast with Brazilian actors, is really a lighthearted parable about the mystery and comic unpredictability of life. Nobody in the movie gets what he expects. Araujo's greedy nephew Carlos (Chico Diaz), who appears to be Araujo's heir apparent, is devastated when his uncle leaves the bulk of his fortune to  Graca, a young woman he didn't know existed. 
Graca is as surprised as anyone by her windfall. Her mother, sworn to secrecy about her paternity, never told Graca that the creepy older man who used to follow her around, pestering her and offering her money  was really her father. To receive her  inheritance, Graca must move from her mother's home to Araujo's large estate and listen to her dead benefactor's taped reminiscences. The stories he tells are flashbacks that make up the heart of the movie. 
In accordance with its fanciful, phantasmagoric narrative, ''Testamento'' has been directed by Francisco Manso as an off-center surreal comedy whose larger-than-life characters seem to be having fun even when tearing out their hair in frustration. Mr. Xavier's Araujo is a fretting street-smart clown. Extremely self-regarding and wildly impulsive, he hangs a picture of himself on his office wall between a portrait of Abraham Lincoln and a  reproduction of the ''Mona Lisa.'' 
The movie makes much of his farcically sad love life, which begins with his impulsive seduction of Graca's mother on his office desk, continues with a stripper who gives him a venereal disease and culminates with his May-December romance with the mysterious Adelia (Karla Leal), a beautiful young woman who breaks his heart. 
''Testamento,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinemas, is so episodic it often feels like a series of disconnected vignettes. And not all the mysteries it uncovers are worth the buildup. With its lilting Cape Verdean folk score (including a song by the international star Cesaria Evora), the movie exudes the charm of a modern folk tale drawled over a lazy afternoon when there's nothing better to do than exchange tall stories.

‽Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane‽,‽Joe Carnahan's maniacally frenzied little film, ''Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' is set in the desert wasteland around Needles, Calif., where Sid (Mr. Carnahan) and his partner Bob (Dan Leis), two motor-mouthed used-car salesmen, are desperately trying to keep their failing business afloat. Just when they are about to throw in the towel, their sleazy broker hands them an opportunity to make $250,000 simply by letting a 1963 Pontiac LeMans sit in their lot for 48 hours. 
There's a deadly catch, of course. The car, which has been on a long intercontinental journey, will be under constant surveillance by gunslingers who have already left a trail of carnage behind them, and the vehicle is wired to explode should anyone attempt to open the trunk. No sooner has a deal been struck than Sid hatches the notion of stealing the Pontiac and holding it for $500,000 ransom. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. is hard on the trail of the car and its owners. 
''Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' runs on the movie equivalent of fake adrenaline. The story is continually interrupted and kicked into high gear by the flash of sardonic chapter titles and the kind of sonic blasts that punctuate items on tabloid news shows. Between chapter titles, the characters yammer at each other in dialogue that feels semi-improvised, and people get shot. Although the pair succeed in taking the hot car to a repair shop, where blood is discovered leaking from the bottom of the trunk, they don't get much farther than that. The grainy, jittery cinematography and flat deadpan performances give this preposterous scenario a patina of realism. 
The movie aspires to be a David Mamet-like slice of lowlife in the American wasteland with added Quentin Tarantino-like muscle-flexing and dripping gore. Desperate,  lying used car salesmen out for a big score; deadly macho games of gun-waving; suitcases stuffed with drugs and cash; absent women: do I hear a metaphor? It's all grindingly familiar and has been done by others with far more style and credibility. 
''Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and scenes of violence.

‽Six-String Samurai‽,‽In his debut film, ''Six-String Samurai,'' Lance Mungia doesn't have anything to say except that he has done his homework. And he says that stylishly in a shoestring movie that amounts to a kaleidoscopic calling card intended to show prospective employers that he can handle a variety of genres. 
As its title suggests, ''Six-String Samurai,'' written by Mr. Mungia and Jeffrey Falcon, its star, draws from Japan's samurai films as well as cinematic tales built around rock musicians. 
So besides ''The Buddy Holly Story'' and, say, ''Yojimbo,'' Mr. Mungia's film is littered with elements of post-apocalyptic road movies, buddy adventures, odd-couple comedies, spaghetti westerns, Death in the style of Ingmar Bergman, ''Star Wars,'' ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' low-budget 1950's cold war sci-fi chillers, war films and, of course, the ineluctable ''Wizard of Oz,'' all to the accompaniment of a sprightly rock score by the Red Elvises, a group of Russian-born musicians. 
''Six-String Samurai,'' which Mr. Mungia says traces its origins to his effort to create an undergraduate thesis film, tells the story of Buddy (Mr. Falcon) and the Kid (Justin McGuire). Set in 1957, after an atomic war has devastated the United States and led to Russian occupation, it puts Buddy on the road to Lost Vegas, the last bastion of freedom, where a successor to Elvis, the dead King, is to be chosen. 
Buddy, packing a guitar and a samurai sword, and dressed in a tattered dark suit and accessorized with the heavy black-framed eyeglasses that recall Buddy Holly, is bound for Lost Vegas along a road filled with lethal and musical rivals when he encounters and saves the Kid from the bad guys who have just killed his mother. 
The laconic Buddy would like the Kid to get lost, but no such luck. Soon they are headed for Lost Vegas, through assorted villains and perils, including Death and his henchmen. 
Filmed mostly in Death Valley, with Kristian Bernier as cinematographer, ''Six-String Samurai'' depicts its harsh landscape with a sharp, clear eye and recounts its silly, derivative tale with tongue firmly in cheek. 
But it remains an apprentice work that leaves the hope that Mr. Mungia's scholarship, perseverance and technical skills will someday be applied to more original material. 
''Six-String Samurai'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Although menace is prevalent and the body count is high, most of the violence in this film is highly stylized, and blood, while evident, is minimal.

‽Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore‽,‽Every American city has its band of young, self-styled outsiders. And in the unidentified Bible Belt town that is the setting for Sarah Jacobson's crude, heartfelt movie ''Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore,'' they all seem to work in the same seedy local movie theater. The modes of teen-age and post-teen-age rebellion on display aren't especially exotic. Hard drinking, sleeping around, some bisexuality and cautious body piercing are the chief manifestations of nonconformism among the staff. 
The movie follows the adventures of Mary Jane (Lisa Gerstein), a high school senior from a ''nice'' suburb who takes a part-time job working the popcorn machine and learns some useful life lessons while hanging out with this not-so-wild bunch. 
Jane, as she is called, may come from a protected background, but when upset she can curse like a truck driver. Much of her venom is aimed at Steve (Shane Kramer), a leather-jacketed young man who in the movie's opening scene is shown deflowering her in a cemetery while she cries out in pain and anger. Her leftover rage is directed toward Matt (Andrew David DeAngelo), an obnoxious, alcoholic, male chauvinist and self-proclaimed stud whom all the women on the premises agree is an inept, inconsiderate (and when drunk, which is most of the time) impotent lover. 
The movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, is a homemade affair by Ms. Jacobson, who wrote, directed, edited and produced it. While it has a certain polemical force, its story feels slapped together and the acting ranges from the competent to the amateurish. 
The fuel that drives ''Mary Jane'' is the film maker's anger at male sexual selfishness, women's ignorance of their own bodies and a culture that encourages women to lie about their sexual pleasure. In the course of travels, Jane learns about self-pleasure from a bisexual co-worker named Ericka (Beth Ramona Allen), who has her own punk band, and experiences nonpenetrative bliss with Tom (Chris Enright), the staff's resident dreamboat. Once she feels more self-confidence, Jane gleefully engineers the awful Steve's humiliating comeuppance. 
Ms. Gerstein, who bares a striking physical and vocal resemblance to Kathy Najimy, looks and acts a bit older than 17. In a movie that translates the sexual gospel according to Dr. Ruth Westheimer into a kind of punk-rock sermon on sexual etiquette, Ms. Gerstein gives a blunt, feisty performance.

‽Port Djema‽,‽Eric Heumann has a way with violence. In his new film, ''Port Djema,'' the sound of a single gunshot on the nearly empty streets of an African town is absolutely horrifying. Mr. Heumann conveys a suddenness and an immediacy to the gunfire that the average Hollywood action thriller, with thousands of rounds of ammunition, can't achieve. ''Port Djema'' has a great sense of the sinister; too bad the rest of it is so shapeless. 
Pierre Feldman (Jean-Yves Dubois), a French surgeon with better things to do, travels to Port Djema, a fictional African nation, because he made a promise to a dear friend, a doctor who was recently killed there. The promise was to locate one particular child and see that he was cared for. The film purports to have a plot, but it's only a riddle (who is the mystery child?), introduced briefly and almost immediately solved and tossed away. 
But Pierre does set out on the search, in the middle of the country's ethnic civil war, with the child's photograph in hand. In the process he meets a woman who photographs the shadows of palm trees (Nathalie Boutefeu), deals with corruption and life-threatening hostility and comes face to face with the country's desperate need for medical care, particularly for the children. Will Pierre stay and help or get out while the getting's good? The suspense about this decision lasts two minutes at most. 
Mr. Heumann, a producer of films like ''Indochine'' and ''Ulysses' Gaze,'' directed ''Port Djema'' and was one of its writers, along with Jacques Lebas, a French doctor. From 1988 to 1991, Dr. Lebas ran a humanitarian medical organization that did work in Lebanon, Cambodia, Romania and what was then the Soviet Union. He has said that one of the purposes of the film is to transmit ''something of the questions raised by contacts with the world's wounds.'' 
''Port Djema'' doesn't go nearly deep enough into its characters or its situations for real insight, but it does have some lovely, artful cinematography and a heart of gold.

‽Down in the Delta‽,‽What a wonderful world it would be if every American family had older relatives as wise, kind, generous and stern (when necessary) as Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) and Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), the heroes of Maya Angelou's unabashedly inspirational film ''Down In the Delta.'' Together this sister and brother gently and methodically heal the wounded spirit of a Chicago inner-city household on the verge of disintegration, and in the process save their proud family line from possible extinction. 
The movie, which often threatens to disappear into a tub of soapsuds, is elevated immeasurably by the calm, stately performances of Mary Alice and Mr. Freeman. These two fine actors lend their roles a gravity, balance and underlying sense of sorrow that convince you such noble souls really do exist in the world, even if they're few and far between. 
If the term ''family values'' has a taint of right-wing intolerance nowadays, the movie reminds you of what those values, shorn of political ideology, really mean in terms of caring, self-sacrifice and the nurturing of tradition through the honoring of one's ancestors. 
''Down in the Delta,'' which Ms. Angelou directed (it is the poet's debut behind the camera) from a screenplay by Myron Goble, doesn't pretend that love and devotion alone can do the job. When it becomes apparent to Rosa Lynn that her daughter Loretta (Alfre Woodward), her grandson Thomas (Mpho Koaho) and autistic granddaughter Tracy (Kulani Hassen) are in imminent danger of succumbing to the drug-and-gun infested street culture of Chicago, she takes drastic action. Telephoning her brother in Mississippi, she announces that she is sending her daughter and grandchildren south for the summer to stay with him. 
To pay for the journey, Rosa Lynn pawns a priceless heirloom, a sterling silver candelabrum named Nathan that has been in the family for generations. As ''Nathan's'' story comes out in bits and pieces, it becomes a larger-than-life myth (illustrated with flashbacks to slavery times) exemplifying the family's continuity in the face of adversity. 
That story gives ''Down in the Delta'' a resonance that transcends mushy family drama and lends it the aura of a folk tale. Family legends that connect us to our past, the movie  suggests, are necessary for the care and feeding of our souls. 
If ''Down in the Delta'' portrays some moments of family strife, they are very muted in a film that is really an idyllic celebration of a return to one's roots. Even in its relatively gritty early scenes in Chicago, in which Loretta, rejected for a cashier's job because she hasn't learned arithmetic, goes directly from her job interview to a liquor store and from there to a crack house, the edges are softened. Almost as soon as Loretta and her children have settled comfortably in Earl's sprawling house in rural Mississippi, her hard shell begins to melt. 
The film lavishes equal amounts of love on the bucolic Mississippi landscape and on the kind, careworn faces of Earl and his wife, Annie (Esther Rolle), who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Freeman's Earl is a man of infinite patience and tenderness, and the scenes of his gently, painstakingly helping his wife around the house and comforting her when she is afraid are among the rare moments to be found in a contemporary movie in which you see older people caring for one another. 
Earl devotes the same care to Loretta, whom he hires as a waitress in the local restaurant he owns, an establishment called Just Chicken. Also popping up on the homestead is the couple's strapping grown-up son Will (Wesley Snipes), a successful Atlanta lawyer who gives his cousin some useful lessons in self-esteem. 
''Down in the Delta'' may be an impossible dream, a cinematic Hallmark card of familial togetherness, but the vision it offers is still a dream worth dreaming. 
''Down in the Delta'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity and a brief scene in a crack house.

‽The Faculty‽,‽Like Frankenstein, ''The Faculty'' plunders the crypts of cinema for its body parts. Here are the paranoia and parasitism of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' There are the slimy, sharp-toothed creatures of ''Alien.'' And over there are the movie-wise teen-agers of ''Scream.'' 
The list could be extended, but the point is clear: this mediocre sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on world domination breaks no new ground. But it has an engaging cast, with half a dozen appealing young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain moviegoers know it. 
In one of the film's wittier passages, the six high school students puzzling out the mysteries of a small new creature found on a football field, a teacher's corpse in a closet and a sudden outbreak of docility among their normally brutish and dysfunctional schoolmates speculate that paranoid movies of the past may have been part of a plot to soften up the public for the real invasion of the body snatchers. 
By contrast, ''The Faculty,'' directed by Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include ''El Mariachi'' and ''Desperado,'' and written by the ubiquitous Kevin Williams of the ''Scream'' movies and other adolescent adventures, opens with a clunky, bloody, cheap-thrills sequence that colors what happens afterward with triteness. 
So the chief pleasures of the film, such as they are, remain the actors: Jordana Brewster as Delilah, the beauteous, tart-tongued cheerleader captain and editor in chief of the school newspaper; Shawn Hatosky as Stan, her soon-to-be former boyfriend, the quarterback and captain of the Herrington High football team,  who is undergoing a pre-midlife crisis and hanging up his pads; Clea DuVall, as Stokely, the unhappy loner and science-fiction aficionado whom Delilah taunts as a lesbian; Laura Harris as Marybeth, the sweet blond Southern belle who is the new girl in school; Josh Hartnett as the cool Zeke, who peddles homemade inhalable substances, condoms and  fake ID's, among other wares, but happens to be a science genius, and Elijah Wood as Casey, the decent little victim of the school bullies, who turns out just fine. 
The adults aren't bad, either: Salma Hayek, all but hidden behind her tissues as the sniffling school nurse; Bebe Neuwirth as Principal Drake; Famke Janssen as a seemingly shy teacher; Piper Laurie as a senior faculty member, and Robert Patrick (the indefatigable villain of ''Terminator 2'') as the volatile Coach Willis. 
Herrington High is one of those schools that, as Principal Drake explains at the outset, has no money for new computers, a class trip to New York City or a school musical this year, but can come up with cash for all the new football equipment its team needs. 
The locals, she explains, are football people. 
And if ''The Faculty'' is the only movie they see his year, maybe they can be fooled into believing that it is fresh and frightening. 
''The Faculty'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes bloody violence, foul language, inhalation of mood-altering substances and nudity.

‽
‽Mighty Joe Young‽,‽For all the technological expertise behind the 2-ton, 15-foot animatronic ape (augmented by an actor in a monkey suit) who is the title character of ''Mighty Joe Young,'' the beast is still capable of only two facial expressions. When riled, Joe roars, bares his teeth, beats his chest and acts like a conventional movie monster on the rampage. In a calmer mode, embracing his caretaker, Jill Young (Charlize Theron), in his giant paws, Joe turns his mouth down in an expression of childlike docility. 
In his heart of hearts, the darling creature is really just a hirsute little boy pining for the closest thing he knows to a mommy. As long as Jill is around, you can count on him to be a sweetly obedient child following the signals of a flashlight she uses to direct him like a conductor on a podium. 
The film, a remake of the 1949 movie ''Mighty Joe Young,'' starring Terry Moore as Joe's cheesecakey mother surrogate, is essentially ''King Kong'' for kids. Very young kids. The familiar story begins when Jill is a child growing up in Central Africa. One terrible night, both Jill's mother and the mother of the baby ape who grows up to be Joe are killed by evil poachers, but not before Joe has bitten off two fingers from a hand of one of the villains. 
We flash ahead two decades. Little Jill is now Big Jill, a slinky, tomboyish woman who is fiercely protective of her childhood pet, with whom she enjoys playing games of hide and seek. Joe's enormous size has made him a legend, and poachers and zoo keepers from around the world have their eye on him. 
Arriving just in time to save the ape from probable kidnaping is Gregg (Bill Paxton), a kindly American zoologist who persuades Jill to let him transport the beast to an animal conservancy in Los Angeles. Jill agrees on the condition that she remain Joe's caretaker. 
Recognizing Joe from news articles as the ape that cost him his fingers many years earlier, Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia), the poacher who killed Joe's mother and who now  runs his own conservancy in Botswana, descends on Los Angeles, bent on capturing Joe. Apes, like elephants, the movie suggests, never forget. And when Joe spies his mother's killer, he begins acting up. Not even Jill can figure out what's the matter. 
The movie culminates in Joe's going on a mild rampage through the streets of Los Angeles. Compared with ''Godzilla'' or ''King Kong,'' it's very tame stuff, and the only people who get hurt are the bad guys. That's because Joe is essentially an angelic child who identifies with angelic kiddies everywhere. He becomes a hero after risking his life to save a saucer-eyed little tyke trapped in the top car of a burning ferris wheel. 
''Mighty Joe Young,'' directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves. Little children won't notice. In Joe, they can identify with the biggest, cuddliest simian toy a 6-year-old could ever hope to own. 
''Mighty Joe Young'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its early scenes of animal slaughter could frighten young children.

‽
‽Hurlyburly‽,‽''So what kind of friendship is this?'' pleads Eddie (Sean Penn) to his suave housemate, Mickey (Kevin Spacey), in David Rabe's pitch-black comedy ''Hurlyburly.'' 
''Adequate,'' Mickey replies with a shrug. 
No, there's hardly any nurture in the friendships shown in the teeth-grinding Hollywood shark tank of ''Hurlyburly.'' 
In evoking the casual cruelty of contemporary life in a certain time and place, this screen adaptation of David Rabe's play is a misanthropic triumph. The film, which takes place ''a little while ago,'' is set in a movie-industry milieu that feels like the 1980's, when the play was first produced and when cocaine was still conspicuously fashionable in Hollywood. In this toxic social climate, friendships are duplicitous power games and male-female encounters ugly skirmishes in a never-ending series of battles. 
The main characters in this bilious study of macho camaraderie, sexual exploitation and substance abuse are Eddie, a casting director coming apart from drugs and alcohol, and his cool, sarcastic business partner and roommate, Mickey. These two party animals share a sleek mirror-and-glass-filled condominium in the Hollywood Hills. As the movie begins on a morning of runny noses and hacking coughs, the only breakfast food in the refrigerator turns out to be a package of moldy Snowballs. 
Mr. Penn's Eddie is a whiny, hysterical motor-mouth, a sort of improvisatory philosopher of doom whose unstrung rants are inspired by television images gleaned from his compulsive channel-surfing. Blond and reptilian, Mr. Spacey's Mickey gazes at the world through hooded eyes, his mouth curled in a supercilious sneer. 
What kind of friendship do they have? On this particular morning, the atmosphere is sharpened by Eddie's certainty that his sometime girlfriend, Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), has just slept with Mickey. As the friends argue by car phone, Mickey calmly reminds Eddie that he gave him tacit permission to sleep with Darlene when he announced that ''everybody's free.'' 
Dropping by the house to snort cocaine, smoke dope and swap nasty sexual war stories are Artie (Garry Shandling), a beady-eyed Hollywood bigwig, and Phil (Chazz Palminteri), a thuggish would-be actor with ''three kids in Toledo I haven't seen since I went to prison.'' One afternoon Artie brings his buddies a sexual ''care package'' in the person of Donna (Anna Paquin), a brash, itinerant teen-ager he met in an elevator. 
Phil, a human pit bull who idolizes Eddie, is desperate to save his unraveling marriage to a wife he has been regularly beating up. Should he stop taking pills to reduce his sperm count and give her the baby she craves? In the movie's chilliest moment, after that child has arrived, Artie picks up the baby girl and marvels at the fact that ''this sweet little thing, this innocent little thing, guys, this is a broad of the future.'' 
That tender moment arrives long after Eddie has fixed up Phil on a disastrous blind date with Bonnie (Meg Ryan), a stripper, single mother and self-described ''drug person'' who in another of the movie's nastier moments is recalled having had sex in the back seat of a car while her traumatized 6-year-old daughter looked on. 
As directed by Anthony Drazen, ''Hurlyburly'' has been opened up somewhat. (A crucial act of violence not shown in the play is portrayed in the movie.) The film nevertheless still captures the play's claustrophobic sense of being trapped in a smoke-filled room with people who might explode at any second. 
The film's close-up photography magnifies every reddened eyelid and plume of cigarette smoke. After a while the images of dissipated faces and the rhythm of the characters' aimless, ugly, hard-boiled banter settles into a woozy, sodden tango of word and image. These are people most of us would rather not be in the same room with, but the movie shoves them in our faces. 
The ensemble acting surpasses that of any other film this year. Mr. Penn, his face swollen and crumpling, his voice rising in childish hysteria, burrows so deeply into Eddie that he almost vomits his character onto the screen. Mr. Spacey's cobralike Mickey is as slippery and cool as Mr. Penn's Eddie is volatile, while Mr. Shandling's Artie is the loathsome distillation of a particularly repulsive kind of sleaze: think Larry Sanders without charm or scruples. 
Mr. Palminteri, in a heaving, tragic performance that matches Harvey Keitel's stage original, finds the vestige of a soul under the leathery skin of a stupid, compulsively violent thug with delusions of talent. 
''Hurlyburly'' has been called sexist because of its female characters' slatternly eagerness to gratify these misogynists. Yet each of the film's three women is capable of standing up for herself. Ms. Wright brings a defensive sang-froid to Darlene, whose dispassionate attitude toward sex drives Eddie into a frenzy. (In a ghastly comic set piece, her refusal to choose between a French and a Chinese restaurant sets him off.) Ms. Ryan, muting her customary perkiness, finds a core of pugnacious resilience under Bonnie's bleary-eyed dishevelment. Ms. Paquin's Donna (the least credible of the three women) also has a prickly edge of defiance. 
As it traces Eddie's downward spiral, ''Hurlyburly'' touches on many themes. But above all, it is a contemplation of male friendship and power that proposes the existence of an immutable pecking order. As Mickey is to Eddie (superior, condescending, and betraying), so Eddie is to Phil. Or as Mickey coldly assures Eddie, ''Phil is very safe, because no matter how far you manage to fall, Phil will be lower.'' 
In this bleak vision of male bonding, the quest for dominance (or if not dominance, approval from above) is so all-consuming that women are little more than trophies and bargaining chips. The war between men and women, the movie proposes, is only an offshoot of a larger and more deadly war: the one waged by men against themselves. 
''Hurlyburly'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of profanity, some violence, and sexual situations.

‽Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras‽,‽Directed by Mike Lyddon, Will Frank and Karl DeMolay 
Not rated, 75 minutes 
Mardi Gras in New Orleans, a time of masquerade, has yielded up a film masquerading as achievement. 
Amateurish and incoherent, ''Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras'' is said by its publicity to have been made on a $5,000 budget, which seems largely to have been misspent. The money has bought a tedious, crude-looking, crudely contrived, mostly black-and-white mess that tries to mingle horror, comedy and homages to far better filmmakers in a disjointed story about a ravenous zombie on the loose in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. 
Tossed into the mix are a documentary film crew, a couple out of a French film (accompanied by subtitles), alileo loosed from purgatory on a mission to stop the zombie and the Mardi Gras itself, from parades, floats and musicians to, whenever possible, bare-breasted women. 
The juvenile ideas of comedy run to toilet humor; the acting seems unworthy of the name, and as a whole the film, which opens today at Den of Cin at Two Boots Video 44 (Avenue A, near East Third Street, East Village), is sluggish and starved for style and originality. 
''Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras'' was produced, directed and written by Mike Lyddon, Karl DeMolay and Will Frank. The film may fancy itself to be an ''in'' joke. It is in fact a sore trial.   LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

‽Galapagos‽,‽In 1835, Charles Darwin visited the Galápagos Islands, a small archipelago off Ecuador, in the H.M.S. Beagle, and the curious species of bird, lizard and tortoise he found there helped him formulate the theory of natural selection. 
A marine biologist named Carole Baldwin visited these islands 163 years later on the research vessel Seward Johnson, taking along equipment that Darwin would have envied, including a high-tech bathysphere and a pair of Imax 3-D cameras. 
Darwin recorded his discoveries in notebooks and later published them in ''The Voyage of the Beagle.'' What Dr. Baldwin saw on the islands, and at the bottom of the nearby ocean, can be seen in ''Galápagos,'' a 40-minute feature that opens today at the Loews Imax Theater at Lincoln Square. 
The Imax three-dimensional format might have been designed for a future stage of human evolution. Its enormous screen exceeds the capacities of the human eye: you can never see the whole image, and so you dwell inside it, in the jagged foreground of a deep, flat picture. It's a nice way to experience the wonders of the natural world, though you may wish that Mark Isham's score didn't overwhelm the crashing of the surf and that the filmmakers, Al Giddings and David Clark, had refrained from manufacturing silly fish noises. 
The narration, read by Kenneth Branagh, proclaims the wonder and variety of life, though it's a bit light on information, not quite rising to the level of a PBS nature documentary or an interactive display at the American Museum of Natural History. And though Imax projection certainly renders the strange creatures and dramatic rock formations of Galápagos larger than life, it also makes them seem a little less real. Still, it's hard to resist the lumbering Galápagos tortoise, the skittering bright-orange crabs or the legions of proud black marine iguanas that sun themselves en masse on outcroppings of petrified lava. 
Darwin, for the most part, kept to the land, studying the islands' marine life through a glass-bottomed bucket. But Dr. Baldwin, and ''Galápagos,'' soon forsake the shore for deep water, where the film's most fascinating parts take place. First, we visit relatively shallow reefs that swarm with silvery fish and hammerhead sharks, and then, in the Johnson Sea-Link, a deep-water vessel Jules Verne might have dreamed up, we proceed to the lightless depths 3,000 feet below the surface. There, Dr. Baldwin, aided by the Sea-Link's vacuum-tube arms, collects strange squishy things, some of which have apparently never been glimpsed by human eyes. One of them, a spiny, popeyed fish, almost looks affronted by the intrusion, and alarmed by the prospect of imminent celebrity.

‽
‽Pariah‽,‽''Pariah,'' which begins a weeklong engagement at the Screening Room tonight, opens with the voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. warning that ''racism is a sickness unto death.'' But this new film by Randolph Kret mistakes the study of a particularly virulent set of symptoms for a diagnosis. 
There is no doubt that the Southern California skinheads who rampage through the movie are sick people. When they are not spewing obscenities at blacks, gays and one another or committing acts of wanton brutality against blacks, gays and one another, they are apt to be recalling lives of loneliness and abuse. But having discovered these pathologically angry souls, Mr. Kret, who directed ''Pariah'' from his own script, seems unsure about what to do with them. 
What he tries to do is send an outsider into their ugly little world. Steve (Damon Jones) is a quiet white grad student type whose world is shattered when the skinheads attack him and his African-American girlfriend, Sam (Elexa Williams). Sam, gang-raped while Steve is forced to look on helplessly, goes home, cuts her wrists and dies. Steve decides to take revenge. But first he shaves his head, dons red suspenders and an angry scowl and decorates his arms with Nazi tattoos. 
The idea of an ordinary, tolerant white person going undercover into a world of extreme race-hatred is a promising one. (It was the subject of Costa-Gravas's interesting 1988 film ''Betrayed,'' starring Debra Winger and Tom Berenger.) But to bring the idea to life requires a script and an actor capable of conveying the psychological complications such a journey must entail. 
Steve's motives are never made very clear. Why didn't he call the police? (The answer seems to be that Los Angeles, despite being overrun by gangs of marauding youths who carry out their attacks in broad daylight, doesn't have any.) And why, if he's so inclined, doesn't Steve just track his assailants down and kill them? Why would he want to make friends with them first? His decision is presented as if it were the most natural response to what has befallen him and yet on reflection it seems completely absurd. 
For his part Mr. Jones, a slow-moving, passive screen presence, doesn't adequately register the nuances of guilt, rage and curiosity his character needs to hold our interest or elicit our sympathy. 
Nuance is not something Mr. Kret has much use for. The lives of the skinheads are so nasty and brutish that it seems hard to imagine that any young person, however alienated or ideologically zealous, would want to go near them. 
And in a misguided attempt to give the film some political balance and complexity, Mr. Kret conjures up a group of hyped-up, violent young black men (the only black male characters in the movie), who drive around the city terrorizing whites and who introduce gunfire where before there had been bats, fists and knives. This gang and the mob of vengeful gays who later lay waste to the skinheads' crash pad are on hand to make the point that the world is trapped in a cycle of retributive violence. 
There is no doubt that ''Pariah'' is a relentlessly violent film. It is also simplistic, repetitive and morally confused. Mr. Kret clearly wants to generate an atmosphere of assaultive intensity, but after a while the raised voices and pounding fists induce a kind of weary numbness. The only real charge comes from the soundtrack, which features some terrific songs by antiracist hardcore bands like Minor Threat, Social Unrest and the Wives. 
With the exception of the attack on Steve and Sam, the scenes of violence tend to be sloppily filmed and loosely edited, and the sheer number of them further dilutes their effectiveness. Matters are not helped by the acting, which ranges from almost credible (Aimee Chaffin as the chief skinhead's moll; David Lee Wilson as his sociopathic sidekick) to unwatchable (Ann Zupa as a neurotic fat girl; Anna Padgett as a skittish junkie; Brandon Slater as the gang's mentally retarded mascot). 
Racist extremism is a problem. We need movies that address it. Chances are you already agree with these propositions. All ''Pariah'' succeeds in doing is screaming them at you, at maximum volume, over and over and over.

‽The Talented Mr. Ripley‽,‽A FLOOD of adjectives bursts onto the screen at the start of Anthony Minghella's glittering new thriller, considering ways to describe Tom Ripley before settling on ''talented'' as le mot juste. This is only a minuscule show of ingenuity, but it's also a promise that the film will keep. ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' offers diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look. 
Its opening credit sequence alone is a model of exquisitely economical suggestion, showing how the loan of a jacket with a Princeton insignia leads Tom from the life of a New York City men's room attendant to a thrillingly new world of opportunity. In a rush of gorgeous, agile exposition, Tom winds up in Europe, learning to say ''This is my face'' in Italian as he trains his binoculars on Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie is the spectacularly charismatic dilettante whose life Tom will eventually steal. 
''I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors,'' remarks the chauffeur who drives Tom away from a bleak Manhattan neighborhood and hands him his first-class ticket for an ocean passage. In light of the mind games that the movie has in store, both the remark and the carnal high-low contrast (meat hangs on hooks near the limousine) are as splendidly barbed as they can be. 
As a playwright and television writer who came to filmmaking with two comparatively modest, whimsical efforts (''Truly, Madly, Deeply'' and ''Mr. Wonderful'') before the exponential leap of ''The English Patient,'' Mr. Minghella now establishes that his Oscar-winning triumph was no fluke. His hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story has the same kind of complex allure that made ''The English Patient'' so mesmerizing. 
This is a more conventional opportunity, being essentially the story of a homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps. But Mr. Minghella, who wrote and directed ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with acute attention to every nuance, significantly broadens what Ms. Highsmith had in mind. Adding a couple of important new characters and bringing the secrets of Tom's sexual longings to the surface, he risks losing the profound chill that made Ripley so disturbing in the first place. The character is several shades less loathsome and more conscience-stricken than he was to begin with, and his homosexuality is more openly expressed. But as played by Matt Damon with a fine, tricky mix of obsequiousness and ruthlessness, the nicer new Ripley is in no danger of losing his sting. 
In a scenic, voluptuously beautiful film (kudos to the cinematographer, John Seale) that has a traffic-stopping cast, Mr. Minghella carefully plants the seeds of mayhem. When Tom is hired by Dickie's father (James Rebhorn) to bring the ne'er-do-well Greenleaf scion home from Italy, he contrives to bump into Dickie on the beach and to echo Dickie's infatuation with American jazz. The year is 1958, and it seems an impossibly glamorous time as depicted among pampered American expatriates in some of Italy's most breathtaking settings. 
Tom's tricks, from wearing an embarrassingly skimpy chartreuse bathing suit to casually flashing some of Dickie's favorite record albums, neatly accomplish their purpose. Soon he has made himself Dickie's latest diversion, and managed this without even alienating Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), Dickie's girlfriend. Marge was a thick, lumpen target for Tom's misogyny in Ms. Highsmith's version. Here, though still hopelessly oblivious to sexual currents between the men, she becomes a reminder that Ms. Paltrow makes as savvy a character actress as she does a swanlike leading lady. 
A word about the film's Dickie Greenleaf: this is a star-making role for the preternaturally talented English actor Jude Law. Beyond being devastatingly good-looking, Mr. Law gives Dickie the manic, teasing powers of manipulation that make him ardently courted by every man or woman he knows. During the first half of the film, Dickie is pure eros and adrenaline, a combination not many actors could handle with this much aplomb. 
During one especially sharp-edged scene here, as the tensions surrounding Dickie approach the unbearable, the handsome heir indulges in what he dismissively calls ''Marge maintenance'' on his sailboat. Leaving Tom and another rich crony, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman, scene-stealingly wonderful here), to wait uneasily during this sexual interlude, Dickie avidly plays off each passenger on the boat against the others. Something has to give. 
When it does, in the deadly encounter that sends Tom Ripley into his new life, the film changes greatly in tone. Once its touristy idyll is over, ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' becomes an elaborate round of gamesmanship about Tom's sleight of hand and how it can be sustained. The ruse, which Mr. Damon handles coyly and credibly, if not with the nascent Norman Bates streak that the situation warrants, is given an added complication by the presence of Meredith Logue. Meredith is a needy post-debutante played irresistibly by Cate Blanchett. Once Meredith latches onto Tom, who she thinks is Dickie, whom she regards as a bored and wealthy kindred spirit, the story has developed all the dizzying cross-currents it deserves. 
The last part of the film, which opens tomorrow, runs into problems.  Eventually tangled up, like Tom, in the particulars of a trail of crime, it tries to use yet another of Tom's attractions (to another new character, played by Peter Smith-Kingsley) to settle his fate. And despite the occasional flash of Hitchcockian magic -- like a scene involving a razor blade in the pocket of a white bathrobe -- there are late scenes that flounder or lag. These concluding events are far less meaningful than the ones that sent Tom on his odyssey of self-invention in the first place. As with any great impostor, there's more to say about where he came from than where he has to go. 
''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief and implied sexual situations, strong sexual undercurrents, profanity and murder.

‽
‽Galaxy Quest‽,‽Whether you love ''Star Trek'' or laugh at it, your starship is about to come in, docking in the form of ''Galaxy Quest,'' an amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable. 
''Galaxy Quest,'' opening tomorrow, spins out of a single joke, about a bunch of washed-up actors from a canceled television series who are enlisted by some credulous interplanetary simpletons to champion them in conflict with a scaly, bellicose villain who has all but exterminated their people. If ''Galaxy Quest'' never attains consistently giddy heights as it plays out its combination of knowing satire and heroic adventure, it nevertheless keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek, offers a few genuine laughs, moves swiftly, if not at warp speed, and is led by a talented cast. 
The crew includes Tim Allen as the egotistical Jason Nesmith. To his legions of fans, he is Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, of the immortal line ''Never give up; never surrender.'' Sigourney Weaver, no stranger to combat with slimy space aliens, plays Gwen DeMarco, known to her fans as Lt. Tawny Madison, the voluptuous communications officer aboard Taggart's ship, Protector. And Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane, who sadly remembers that he once portrayed Richard III in the days before he signed on to become the Spock-like humanoid Dr. Lazarus. 
These actors and Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, alias Tech Sergeant Chen, and Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber, the navigator Lieutenant Laredo, have been reduced to signing autographs at fan shows for $15 a pop and snipping ribbons at supermarket openings when fate (directed by Dean Parisot from a script by David Howard and Robert Gordon) intervenes. 
In a scene that skewers the ubiquitous ''Star Trek'' fan conventions, as the testy, disheartened crew copes with costumed cultists, minutiae-obsessed teenagers and giggling groupies, Nesmith-Taggart is approached by a group of odd creatures he assumes are fans. He dismisses their monotonous babble. 
The next day, after he wakes up on the floor at home, hung over after a night of solitary drinking, they whisk him off to what he thinks is another re-enactment: a negotiation as Taggart with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) on behalf of the gentle Thermians. But when Nesmith-Taggart is miraculously returned, he realizes that he has been aboard a genuine spaceship. 
It seems that the Thermians, led by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), believe the courage- and principle-filled ''Galaxy Quest'' television episodes they have witnessed to be actual historical documents and have sought out Taggart to lead them. 
''Alexander,'' Taggart tells the once and future Dr. Lazarus after he rises to the challenge and enlists his old crew, ''this is the role of a lifetime.'' 
So off they go, joined -- in one of the film's best comic conceptions -- by Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), now a convention organizer but once an obscure bit player who died a quick death in episode 81. Throughout the adventure, as the heroes do battle with Sarris and his minions, encounter cannibalistic space creatures who resemble children, face off against assorted monsters and other perils while standing between the Thermians and extinction, Fleegman remains convinced that being an unknown actor, he is fated by the laws of scriptwriting to perish once more. 
In the parched comic landscape that now stretches over much of planet Earth, ''Galaxy Quest'' may not be a monument to the genre, but it offers a ray of hope for the future. 
''Galaxy Quest'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes a mildly crude word, a standard issue of space monsters and associated violence.

Running time: 102 minutes. This film is rated PG. 
WITH: Tim Allen (Jason Nesmith), Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco), Alan Rickman (Alexander Dane), Tony Shalhoub (Fred Kwan), Sam Rockwell (Guy Fleegman), Daryl Mitchell (Tommy Webber), Robin Sachs (Sarris) and Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar). 
‽
‽Any Given Sunday‽,‽As a cinematic flasher of not-so-secret mass culture fantasies, Oliver Stone is Hollywood's R-rated answer to P. T. Barnum. Instead of clowns, aerialists and lion tamers, he parades his own hyper-macho vision of modern American life as a primitive bread-and-circuses carnival of power, greed, lust, fame and violence (especially violence). And in ''Any Given Sunday,'' his viscerally charged, razzle-dazzle ode to professional football as a blood sport, he comes up with some quintessentially zany Oliver Stone moments. 
Take the scene in the locker room of the Miami Sharks in which a heavily muscled naked football player with a mammoth sexual endowment is placed directly in front of the camera. The shot is held for an extra half-beat as if to say: ''Look at it. We all know that this is what football is really about: colliding superstuds whose bedroom conquests we would like to imagine are the erotic equivalent of their stadium feats.'' 
In another scene in which the Sharks' head coach, Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), lectures the hotshot young quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) on being a team player, the movie lards in clips of the climactic chariot race from ''Ben-Hur.'' In case we haven't already gotten the movie's blatant message about football being the home-grown equivalent of a Roman gladiatorial circus, here it is spelled out again. Later the movie actually trots out Charlton Heston for a cameo appearance as the moralizing commissioner of the Associated Football Franchises of America. It should be no surprise that Mr. Stone is as gleefully at home inside a football stadium as he is on the battlefield, since his new movie portrays professional football and wartime combat as variations of the same experience. 
The film's most exciting scenes take place in the bone-crushing thick of the fray, and they provide about as acute a sense of straining muscle and excruciating collision as a football movie could hope to give. Like  battlefield casualties, injured players are rushed off the field on stretchers. And at halftime, the locker room resembles a hospital emergency ward where players who are not too badly injured are frantically sewn up and shot up with painkillers, then sent back into battle. 
Encasing all this action, the director and his collaborators John Logan and Daniel Pyne have erected the shell of a story that is a crude morality play in the style of Mr. Stone's ''Wall Street.'' The biggest struggle pits the old school of football philosophy against the new. That old school is exemplified by the battle-weary Tony D'Amato and the Sharks' loyal but fading star quarterback, the legendary Jack Rooney, known as Cap (Dennis Quaid), who at 39 is nearing the end of his career. Tony and Cap represent a cooperative team-player ethic that is being undermined by big money and the star-making power of television. 
The new school is embodied by the gifted but arrogant and relatively inexperienced Willie, who catapults from third-string quarterback into the Sharks' resident superstar. In a matter of months, Willie has also scored a chart-topping rap hit and landed some lucrative television commercials. But Willie is so green that he throws up before every game. Not groomed to be a team player, he infuriates Tony by calling his own shots in the huddles. But when his spontaneous decisions win games and the Sharks' sagging fortunes start to reverse, Tony's old-school philosophy is increasingly called into question. 
Willie's flash is backed by the Sharks' ruthless owner, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), who inherited the team with her alcoholic mother (Ann-Margret) from her football legend of a father, who was also Tony's mentor. Other moral conflicts pit the Sharks' coldbloodedly pragmatic orthopedist, (and Dr. Feelgood) Harvey Mandrake (James Woods), who risks the lives of the players to keep them in the game at all costs, and its young internist, Oliver Powers (Matthew Modine), who is appalled by Mandrake's reckless decisions. 
For much of the movie, the kinetic furor of the game sequences helps camouflage the weaknesses of a screenplay that is a mechanically contrived series of power struggles, each of which has an issue attached to it. But as the movie develops into a kind of mega-''Rocky'' with a end-of-game sequence that stretches nine seconds of play into many minutes, the strains begin to show. 
Those strains extend to some crucial performances. Mr. Quaid appears several years too old (and not in good enough shape) for his role, and Ms. Diaz, who can be such a winning comedian, is not up to the dramatic demands of her unsympathetic character. But Mr. Pacino's Tony is a solid if well-worn variation on a familiar Pacino type, a weather-beaten not-so-young true believer stretched beyond his limits and forced to re-evaluate his entire life. The movie's revelation is Mr. Foxx's Willie, who gracefully embodies the internal conflicts of a talented, insecure athlete. Embittered by years of racial discrimination and tempted by the rewards of instant celebrity, he struggles not to lose his humanity amid the hoopla. It's a subtle performance in a movie that has nothing else subtle about it. 
As usual, Mr. Stone's attitude toward the frenzy he has conjured is wildly ambivalent. ''Any Given Sunday,'' like so many other Stone films dealing with violence, embraces the visceral Dionysian thrill of professional football with the ecstatic eagerness of a scaredy-cat who has conquered his fear of skydiving and become addicted to jumping out of airplanes. At the same time it is also an expose of professional football and its sins and the mad, mindless excesses of greed, power-mongering, exploitation and phallic worship it enshrines. 
In the end the movie cops out. Although the story presents many opportunities for tragedy (some situations practically beg for it), ''Any Given Sunday'' turns ludicrously upbeat as it hastily ties all its strands together. P. T. Barnum liked happy endings too. Circus lions are in the ring to be tamed, aerialists are expected not to fall. The final message of ''Any Given Sunday'' is one big thumbs up: Let the games begin. 
''Any Given Sunday'' is rated R. It has profanity, sexual situations and lots of playing-field violence.

‽
‽Man on the Moon‽,‽Andy Kaufman's mind games with his audiences played on an element of the unknown. Whether he was treating everyone in Carnegie Hall to milk and cookies or spewing abuse in his corrosive Tony Clifton mode, it was crucial that the viewer never know whether to laugh or squirm. Kaufman's precocious genius for ironic detachment seemed extreme, to the point where his death in 1984 struck even his loved ones as a possible put-on. But time has turned  Kaufman into a hugely influential avatar of confrontational comedy. Jim Carrey, to name just one spiritual descendant, would not be possible without him. 
Now Mr. Carrey delivers an electrifying homage in ''Man on the Moon,'' Milos Forman's vivid re-creation of Kaufman's too-short and enduringly strange career. (The film takes its title from R.E.M.'s ghostly musical tribute to the Kaufman spirit.) In a film that summons its subject's most memorable creative inventions as a series of greatest hits, Mr. Carrey makes a flawless, uncanny impersonator. It's all here: the timid, wide-eyed Foreign Man, the sneering wrestling matches with women, the reading of ''The Great Gatsby'' in its entirety to a dumbfounded college audience, the priceless pantomime of the ''Mighty Mouse'' theme song. 
But what is missing here, though it might have been the first thing expected from an ostensible film biography, is an answer to the simplest question: Who was Andy Kaufman, and how did he get that way? ''Man on the Moon,'' which takes the form of a surprisingly straightforward show business rise-and-fall story, isn't telling. Whether this is a strictly artistic choice or an indication that the generous treatment of Kaufman's agent, girlfriend and immediate family make this a somewhat authorized version, it limits the film's ability to give Kaufman three dimensions. That's a dramatic liability even if you believe, as perhaps the filmmakers do, that Kaufman was no more of a cipher to audiences than he was to himself. 
''Man on the Moon'' is another big, vibrant collaboration between Mr. Forman and the screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Together they brilliantly evoked the world of ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' in all its absurdity and unlikely gravitas. But their new film remains more opaque, perhaps because Kaufman was such a self-conscious figure in the first place. Unlike Mr. Flynt or Ed Wood (whom the writers also summoned so wonderfully in Tim Burton's film), Kaufman does not offer the creative leeway of an unexamined life. 
Hamstrung as it may be, ''Man on the Moon'' is still a formidable piece of work. As it dutifully revisits the milestones of the Kaufman career, the film benefits enormously from Mr. Carrey's way of channeling his character. 
Artfully distilled, the Kaufman happenings (that's what they were) are rendered faithfully yet made tighter and funnier. Without losing Kaufman's penchant for letting an audience twist in the wind, Mr. Carrey adds his own stamp to the material by making it brighter. 
Fleshing out the story of how Kaufman progressed from a middle-class upbringing in Great Neck, N.Y., to the crowd-baiting outer limits of the comedy frontier, the film needs to give him a succession of sounding boards. These include Danny DeVito (one of the film's producers) as the agent George Shaprio, who is given a ''Eureka!'' moment when he is first made privy to a Kaufman put-on, and who later becomes Kaufman's staunch protector. 
Also used here in a similar capacity is Bob Zmuda (played likably by Paul Giamatti), the writing partner and co-conspirator who helped Kaufman create his boorish lounge-act alter ego, Tony Clifton. The unapologetic ugliness and aggression of the Clifton character is, like Kaufman's avid delight in wrestling women (Courtney Love appears as one of them), a kink that the film leaves unexplored. 
''Man on the Moon'' is rated R. It includes profanity and sexual situations involving prostitution. 
MAN ON THE MOON 
Directed by Milos Forman; written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; director of photography, Anastas Michos; edited by Christopher Tellefsen and Lynzee Klingman; music by R.E.M.; production designer, Patrizia Von Brandenstein; produced by Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher; released by Universal Pictures.

‽
‽Stuart Little‽,‽The plucky title character of ''Stuart Little'' may be an adorable three-inch-tall digital mouse, but the scene stealer in this delightful screen adaptation of E. B. White's classic children's book is Stuart's feline nemesis, Snowbell. A white Chinchilla Persian cat played by five nearly identical felines and voiced by Nathan Lane in a sly, streetwise New York accent tinged with hauteur, Snowbell is one of the most fully rounded nonhuman characters to appear in a family film in quite some time. Every imperious toss of Snowbell's head and twitch of his petulantly bowed mouth synchronizes so smoothly with Mr. Lane's dialogue that at times he seems remarkably close to being like a real-life talking cat. 
When Stuart (Michael J. Fox, sounding indefatigably perky and upbeat) is adopted by the Little family and goes to live with them in their cozy Manhattan brownstone, Snowbell is outraged that a mouse should have the status of a family member. Jealous and resentful, he longs to pounce on the new arrival and devour him. And because he is a pampered house cat, he is also mortified at the prospect of becoming a laughing stock among his neighborhood cronies should they discover he is ''a cat owned by a mouse.'' 
In the devious scheme Snowbell contrives to get rid of Stuart, a pair of mice posing as Stuart's biological parents call on the Littles to claim their son and take him off to their dingy home in faraway Brooklyn. 
''Stuart Little'' sustains a lovely balance between enchantment and playfulness as it follows Stuart's travels from orphanage, to Manhattan brownstone, to Brooklyn and back to the Littles. It is especially witty in portraying the difficult adjustments Stuart must make in settling comfortably into a human-scale world. One morning, Stuart nearly drowns when he is accidentally tossed into a washing machine. He also has problems bonding with his new parents' human son, George (Jonathan Lipnicki), who was hoping for a playmate of his own species and size. The two eventually find common ground when Stuart enters the miniature mouse-size world of George's electric train set. 
In the movie's most euphoric moment, the boy and the mouse collaborate in a toy boat race in Central Park that begins as a disaster but turns into an unlikely triumph as Stuart pilots the vessel to victory, navigating the alarmingly choppy waters and resisting the aggressive collisions of competing boats. 
''Stuart Little,'' directed by Rob Minkoff from a screenplay by M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Brooker, blends images of the real New York City with an impressionistic storybook version that captures some of the original book's enchanted mid-1940's ambiance. That period feeling is enhanced by the look and demeanor of Mr. and Mrs. Little. As played by Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis, they embody a young child's-eye view of parents as benign but mysterious figures who inhabit another world. 
In the last third of the movie, the conscience-stricken impostors confess their hoax to Stuart and send him back to Manhattan in the toy roadster George gave him. But will Stuart make it home safely or will Snowbell and his alley cat co-conspirators intercept him? When Stuart gets lost in Central Park and is stalked by several hungry cats who plan to divide him up into portions, the magical city becomes a shadowy nightmarish jungle that is spooky but not too frightening for young children. 
The only element that doesn't completely harmonize with the rest of the film is the visually unremarkable digital figure of Stuart. In a movie where everything else is a surreal storybook version of the commonplace, the character often appears too cartoonish for his environment. Of course, for many children, who will be charmed by this fable about learning how to fit in while standing up for yourself, Stuart's very otherness will be taken as proof that he, like every child who identifies with him, is special. 
''Stuart Little'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some young children might be frightened by scenes in which Stuart's life is in danger.

‽
‽Bicentennial Man‽,‽Receiving a gushy cinematic Christmas card from Robin Williams has become almost an annual rite of commerce. But in trying to be all things to all people, ''Bicentennial Man'' easily takes the cake as the star's most grandiose holiday greeting yet. 
This feel-good millennial allegory, adapted from an Isaac Asimov story (and a novel by Asimov and Robert Silverberg), is directed by Chris Columbus, the pull-every-heartstring maestro behind ''Mrs. Doubtfire.'' It follows the 200-year life (beginning in the year 2005) of a robot who yearns to be human and over two centuries metamorphoses from machine into man. By the end of the movie, the robot, named Andrew, has shed his metallic shell, acquired a central nervous system and turned  into Robin Williams, the misty-eyed, empathetic smiling-through-tears sad clown and shameless ham we all know. 
Like other recent Robin Williams products, this one wants to tickle our funny bones while going for the emotional jugular with drippy, sugar-coated New Age sentiments that  echo ''What Dreams May Come,'' ''City of Angels'' and other recent films that have pretended to be touched by angels. The difference between ''Bicentennial Man'' and those movies is that this time the hokum isn't all spiritualist mumbo jumbo. The possibility of a machine (or a ''household appliance'' as Andrew's manufacturer contemptuously describes him) claiming to have human qualities seems increasingly likely. What's not so likely is that a robot, in seeking to be human, would embrace mortality. 
''Bicentennial Man'' tosses around some ideas about the relationship between humans and machines, and it has some good jokes (the early Andrew trying and failing to grasp the essence of humor) and many clever sight gags. Its wittiest character is a feisty, hip-swinging robot named Galatea (Kiersten Warren) equipped with a personality chip that  makes her sashay to Aretha Franklin's ''Respect.'' 
But in zigzagging between low comedy and high sentiment, the movie never settles into a comfortable narrative track. As it takes huge, awkward leaps forward in time, we don't feel as though we're being given glimpses into the future so much as revisiting a standard ''Star Trek''-style fantasy of topless towers and whizzing little airships. And as the movie keeps jumping forward, its characters acquire layers of increasingly fake-looking prosthetic makeup. Except for Mr. Williams, the sitcom-meets-sci-fi acting  throughout the movie is strictly of television caliber. 
The story begins when Andrew is purchased by Richard Martin (Sam Neill), a clockmaker known throughout the film simply as Sir, to be a robotic servant in his picture-postcard California mansion. Sir (looking and sounding like James Mason's double) is happily married to Ma'am (Wendy Crewson). The couple have two girls, the adorable 7-year-old Amanda, known as Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) and her bratty 9-year-old sister Miss (Lindze Letherman), who orders Andrew to jump out her bedroom window. (He obeys and is seriously damaged and left with a lifelong terror of upper-story views.) 
It is after Andrew accidentally breaks one of Little Miss's precious tiny glass horses and replaces it with an exquisite wooden one of his own making that Sir notices Andrew's  creativity and realizes he's a kind of mechanical mutation and becomes his teacher and legal guardian. As Andrew acquires knowledge and reaps a fortune designing timepieces  (Sir insists that Andrew, although a robot, have his own bank account), he falls unrequitedly in love with the now grown-up Little Miss (Embeth Davidtz), who marries (unhappily) and has children. On requesting and being granted his freedom, Andrew leaves the family to live in his own cozy, self-designed beach house. 
The decades hurtle by, and the next thing you know, Andrew, who now looks human but is still missing some human ingredients, meets Little Miss's grown-up granddaughter Portia (Ms. Davidtz). Technology has advanced to the point where the creation of androids who are facsimile humans is possible. Collaborating with Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a San Francisco scientific genius, Andrew, motivated by his passion for Portia, pursues the seemingly impossible goal of achieving full humanity. 
As befits a Robin Williams movie, the screenplay (by Nicholas Kazan) pours on the sentimentality in lumpy, mawkish speeches about freedom, the joys of sex and the meaning of life. Not even Mr. Williams, pulling out every moist, sad-clown expression in his bag of grimaces, can redeem these speeches from sappiness. But as it lumbers toward a  mystical romantic ending in an early-23rd-century hospital, ''Bicentennial Man'' achieves the pop grandiloquence of a ''Star Trek'' installment. In its warm, fuzzy, self-congratulatory humanistic vision, nothing in the universe beats being a flesh-and-blood mortal. 
''Bicentennial Man'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some fairly candid sexual talk. 
BICENTENNIAL MAN 
Directed by Chris Columbus; written by Nicholas Kazan, based on the short story by Isaac Asimov and the novel ''The Positronic Man'' by Asimov and Robert Silverberg; director of photography, Phil Meheux; edited by Neil Travis; music by James Horner; production designer, Norman Reynolds; produced by Wolfgang Petersen, Gail Katz, Neal Miller, Mr. Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan; released by Touchstone Pictures/ Columbia Pictures. Running time: 132 minutes. This film is rated PG. 
WITH: Robin Williams (Andrew), Embeth Davidtz (Grown-Up Little Miss/Portia), Sam Neill (Sir), Oliver Platt (Rupert Burns), Kiersten Warren (Galatea Robotic/Human), Wendy Crewson (Ma'am), Hallie Kate Eisenberg (Little Miss at 7) and Lindze Letherman (Miss). 
‽
‽Anna and the King‽,‽If any movie could be said to be haunted (maybe cursed is a better word) by another movie, it is Andy Tennant's picturesque but stodgy ''Anna and the King.'' The film that does the haunting (and the cursing) is the 1956 film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic Broadway musical ''The King and I,'' based on the same material. 
Watching Mr. Tennant's film, which stars Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat in roles played in the earlier movie by Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, you keep expecting the characters to burst into song, but they never do. And because the mostly solemn dramatic tone of ''Anna and the King'' is so similar to that of ''The King and I,'' the absence of songs comes as a letdown. Especially missed when their moments arrive are ''Getting to Know You,'' ''A Puzzlement'' and above all ''Shall We Dance?'' 
Of course it's unfair to ask ''Anna and the King'' to be anything but what it is. But ''The King and I'' has become so deeply embedded in our culture that its version of the true story that inspired Margaret Landon's book ''Anna and the King of Siam'' supersedes all others in much the same way that ''My Fair Lady'' now looms over Shaw's ''Pygmalion.'' (Before ''The King and I,'' Langdon's work had been adapted into a popular nonmusical 1946 movie starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison.) 
What the new film offers in place of songs is lush local color (the film was shot in Malaysia), grand palaces, dazzling pageantry, one heated battle scene, and a much more enlightened, multiculturally sensitive perspective on world affairs than the view offered by the musical. Here the British (with the exception of Anna) are painted as greedy double-dealing industrial merchants deviously promoting a 19th-century version of globalization. Anna ultimately finds herself pulled between her loyalty to Britain and her pained awareness of her countrymen's racism and deceitfulness. 
''Anna and the King'' is also a misstep for the gifted Ms. Foster, an actress who seems more interested these days in sanctifying herself as an old-fashioned heroine than in taking on dramatically risky roles. Adopting a tentative British accent, she plays the title character as a virtuous, nobler-than-thou ice queen and seems even chillier here than she did in ''Contact.'' 
Ms. Foster's late-90's screen personality often suggests that she is aspiring to fill the shoes of the 60's Julie Andrews in spreading high-minded sweetness and light. But she lacks Ms. Andrews's vigor and down-to-earth sense of fun, and even when being playful she emits a certain guardedness, her sharp blue eyes scrutinizing the surroundings for signs of trouble. Three decades ago Ms. Andrews may have been mocked as embodying a reactionary ickiness, but no one accused her of being thin-blooded. 
Ms. Foster's character, Anna Leonowens, a British widow who traveled to Bangkok in 1862 with her young son to be schoolteacher to the 58 children of King Mongkut, was among other things a spirited pioneer taking enormous chances. But Ms. Foster's Anna hardly seems to have a body. Whatever lust for adventure drove the character to make that journey is barely apparent in Ms. Foster's demure, wary performance. 
Mr. Chow's imperious, polygamous King inevitably begs comparison with Brynner's. Although this Hong Kong superstar lends the king an imposing authority (mitigated by moments of softness), his performance lacks Brynner's terrifying thunder. His carefully shaded performance may be many things, but it is never truly scary. 
''Anna and the King'' has the rambling pace of an episodic 1950's costume drama. As Anna and her cheeky young son, Louis (Tom Felton), adjust to their new life in Southeast Asia, there are the inevitable collisions between Siamese and British ways of thinking. Among the many little dramas that unfold, the most significant involves Tuptim (Bai Ling), the king's newest wife, who refuses to be parted from her lover and flees the palace to join him in a Buddhist monastery. 
Later the focus shifts to regional politics and an attempted coup by the rebellious General Alak (Randall Duk Kim). Siamese politics and military strategy might be described in these scenes as the art of the high-stakes bluff. 
In evoking the undeclared, unconsummated love between Anna and the king, the movie is as prim and tight-lipped as its leading lady. And although Mr. Chow can be charming, even charismatic, he lacks Brynner's swashbuckling sensual magnetism. Without any real sparks between the main characters, ''Anna and the King'' unfolds like an exotic historical diorama with dramatic vignettes thrown in for spice. 
''Anna and the King'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of people who have been tortured and one execution.

‽
‽Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo‽,‽Little sex and less humor await audiences for ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' whose juvenile comedy targets a gallery of imperfect women. These include an obese black, a narcoleptic, a victim of Tourette's syndrome and a giant with a runaway pituitary gland. 
The list also includes a woman with an artificial leg, her sightless roommate and a clerk in a pet fish store who can be induced to unwittingly wet her T-shirted breasts while scooping snails from a tank. 
Among the males are a stereotypical black pimp and a cuckolded police detective given to exposing himself while he rails about the imperfection of his sex organ. 
And given that the protagonist of this film is a fish-tank cleaner and rescuer of goldfish from toilets, the term bathroom humor is appropriate, especially since his father is a men's room attendant. 
The problem with ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' whose title seems intended to evoke memories of ''Ace Ventura, Pet Detective,'' is not its low humor. Low humor has a proud history. The problem with ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' directed by Mike Mitchell from a screenplay by Harris Goldberg and Rob Schneider, is the low level of its low humor. 
The high concept behind this tiny achievement is that Deuce, played by Mr. Schneider, is asked to house-sit for Antoine Laconte (Oded Fehr), a gigolo who must leave the country on high-priced business while a valuable fish in his expensive aquarium in his lavish home is ill. 
Leconte gives Deuce two pieces of advice: don't answer the phone and don't drive the Porsche. Not much time passes before Deuce violates the rules, because he has managed to destroy the fish tank and set fire to the premises. 
So Deuce decides to try life as a gigolo to earn money to restore the damage to Leconte's home. And soon he has attracted a hungry, sloppy, fast-talking pimp, T. J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin), and the attentions of the angry detective, Chuck Fowler (William Forsythe), who wants to build a case against Leconte. T. J. also has some advice for Deuce: don't fall in love with a client. 
As Deuce works his way through an assortment of women, learning that compassion, not sex, is what many need, he eventually meets the innocent Kate (Arija Bareikis), whose friends have arranged for his services. And true love begins to run its troubled course. 
Among devotees of comedy, ''Deuce Bigalow'' is for the undemanding. 
''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes simulated sex, visible breasts, foreplay, partial nudity, sexual innuendo, harsh language and violence.

‽
‽The Green Mile‽,‽Two important figures in ''The Green Mile'' happen to be a giant (Michael Clarke Duncan) and a mouse. But when it comes to this extravagantly long death row drama, there are more important matters of proportion to consider. To watch a film this unhurried (three hours) is to choose a companion for a long ocean voyage. It's a risk, and you hope that neither ship nor speaker runs out of steam. 
It happens that ''The Green Mile,'' written by Stephen King at great length and in multiple installments, does not truly warrant such a marathon. It boils down to a well-populated drama with a relatively simple story, one that could have been told with more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. As adapted by Frank Darabont with as much exemplary skill as he brought to Mr. King's other prison tale, ''The Shawshank Redemption,'' it's a film with a counterproductive tendency to take its time. 
But while a tighter film from Mr. Darabont clearly would have been better, ''The Green Mile'' proves surprisingly successful under the circumstances. First and foremost, it manages to linger on death row without claustrophobia and to become wholeheartedly immersed in what goes on there. Working casually, with the bookend flashback device borrowed from ''Saving Private Ryan,'' it eases into the story of what the very Southern-sounding Paul Edgecomb remembers about his years as a prison guard. Tom Hanks, who is so unaffectedly good that it has become redundant to say so, helps ease the film into its just-folks storytelling mode. 
Edgecomb's bladder problems, which are the sort of thing on which Mr. Darabont might have spent less time, help set up the chatty back-and-forth of life on the Green Mile. (This place, where condemned men take their last walks, got its nickname from the color of its floor.) We meet Edgecomb's fellow guard Brutus Howell, called Brutal (David Morse, who shares Mr. Hanks' laid-back timing and sly delivery). Their colleague and nemesis is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), who is ''the governor's wife's nephew'' and acts accordingly. There are more Green Mile regulars (including James Cromwell as the warden), and each one drops his jaw when Mr. Duncan's John Coffey arrives on the scene. 
Although the colossal Coffey supposedly killed and raped two children, he is a gentle soul. In fact when a mouse turns up as an uninvited pet, Coffey seems delighted. (So do the guards; that's the kind of place this is.) And then, in a scene with the mouse that actually elicited shrieks from a preview audience, another side of Coffey emerges. Finally there is a connection between the business of executing prisoners and the film's strenuously spiritual side. 
''The Green Mile'' involves assorted acts of cruelty and one lurid, extended electrocution scene that makes the horrors of the death penalty grotesquely clear, but much of it is very gentle. The mystical healing of Edgecomb's bladder trouble brings on some funny moments with Bonnie Hunt, who does a charming turn as his wife. Coffey's peculiar innocence is also given a lot of screen time. The way in which this huge black man, who calls the guards Boss, is given a magical capacity for self-sacrifice has its inadvertently racist overtones as well as its Christlike ones. But as Mr. Duncan plays him, Coffey is too flabbergasting a figure to be easily pigeonholed anyhow. 
Mr. Darabont keeps the winding story of ''The Green Mile'' on track while also providing endless opportunities for the actors to shine. The guards' camaraderie (with Barry Pepper as another group member) is droll and engaging, while the prisoners make another kind of strong impression. Harry Dean Stanton brings some bizarre fun to the process of testing electrocution equipment, which is, of course, also rendered with appropriate horror. Sam Rockwell provides loads of local color as the worst, most hateful miscreant ever to wind up on death row. And some characters are allowed to wear out their welcomes before their time is up. There is one overwritten pre-execution speech too many in Mr. Darabont's screenplay. 
As ''The Green Mile'' builds to its inevitable spooky touches -- very few, since this King story concentrates so heavily on character -- its drama mounts even as its seams begin to show. There will turn out to have been much ado about relatively little when the film is over. But unassumingly strong, moving performances and Mr. Darabont's durable storytelling make it a trip worth taking just the same. 
''The Green Mile'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity and some very grisly moments.

‽Toy Story 2‽,‽''Toy Story 2'' can be enjoyed -- enormously -- without wondering exactly why the Pixar animation looks even better than it did the first time. Among the many talents of the director, John Lasseter, and his huge crew of computer-animation pioneers is a gift for making their work look easy. 
Only after leaving the theater is there reason to realize just how much imagination has gone into making this film so enveloping. While its surface is as smooth and witty as that of ''Toy Story'' itself, the sequel and its characters (in the words of an associate technical director) are ''probably twice as complicated under the hood.'' 
This cutting-edge animation franchise still has the power to enchant children while keeping adults entertained. And it has not wasted its technical innovations on junk-food storytelling. Mr. Lasseter's avowed fondness for Frank Capra's films can be seen in the nostalgic world summoned here, and in the fundamental goodness of the toy characters themselves. Without undue sentimentality, this film lets its playthings pull together in ways that would be sweet and funny in any format. 
''Toy Story 2'' begins with a perfectly adorable ''Star Wars'' parody and manages to stay on that same level throughout. With voices delightfully supplied by an even larger cast of familiar actors than the first film had, it sends up video-game heroics before returning Buzz Lightyear, toy astronaut (with the voice of Tim Allen), to the haven known as Andy's room. 
Andy is the child whom the toys worship (perhaps a shade more slavishly than they should), and Andy's going to camp is enough to set a toy crisis in motion. This may be a world in which a yard sale is a big event, but the film invests plenty of feeling in its assorted metaphorical happenings. 
When Woody the cowboy (with the voice of Tom Hanks) accidentally falls into the clutches of a wicked toy collector (played by Wayne Knight, and cleverly rendered right down to the hairs on his arms), the film's value system makes itself known. It turns out that Woody was once a toy celebrity, famous enough to have knocked Sputnik off the cover of a 1957 issue of Life magazine. He got his face on a lunch box in those days, and now he has become an icon of sorts. Flattered by fame, and welcomed by a group of equally collectible friends (with the voices of Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer), he may be in danger of forsaking his old gang for the chance to be lionized. The film manages to make being put into storage, or being displayed in a toy museum in Japan, into workable metaphors for failure and success. 
Of course the filmmakers have spun a lively, tuneful adventure (with a score by Randy Newman, and Sarah MacLachlan and Robert Goulet to enliven the soundtrack) out of this setup. But what they have also done is to add layers of new facial and body movements for the characters, along with much subtler lighting effects (50 separate light sources in once scene, according to the cinematographer, Sharon Calahan). 
Motion is so fine-tuned that the film can stage high adventure in traffic, on baggage-moving machinery at an airport or anywhere else that comes to mind. Like the Japanese landmark ''Princess Mononoke,'' this kind of animation catapults past reality to create whole new realms of imagination. 
Meanwhile, back on the toy shelf, appealingly human emotions are put in play. Buzz discovers that he is only one of many Buzzes, and must come to terms with existential questions about being mass-produced, one of the crowd. Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) now has a wife (Estelle Harris), who offers to pack ''your Angry Eyes, just in case'' when her mate goes off to rescue Woody. 
The toys have their own enemies (including a hilarious take on Darth Vader), their own nightmares (being relegated to the broken-toy heap) and their own triumphs (just getting across a busy street) that take on epic proportions here. And this film continues the work of its predecessor, making sure that computer-generated animation will never be the same.

‽Flawless‽,‽Joel Schumacher's garish, message-laden comedy, ''Flawless,'' is so awful it just might put an end to Hollywood's hypocritical infatuation with men in drag as symbols of its own supposedly liberated sexual attitudes. If so, that would be an unintended benefit. 
Set on Manhattan's Lower East Side and fluffed out with foolish subplots involving stolen drug money and a drag queen beauty contest, the movie is essentially a comic duet for two gifted actors putting the best possible faces on roles that are little more than one-dimensional mouthpieces. 
Robert De Niro is Walt Koontz, a retired New York policeman who falls into a depression after he is disabled by a stroke suffered while trying to foil a robbery in an upstairs neighbor's apartment. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Rusty, his drag- queen neighbor who ends up giving Walt speech therapy in the form of singing lessons. Those lessons turn out to be much more than vocal exercises (one assignment is to learn to sing the tongue-twisting Shirley Ellis hit, ''The Name Game''). 
They are lessons in courage and compassion proffered by an oppressed but indomitable spirit who knows the meaning of suffering and rejection. By the end of the movie, the once rabidly homophobic policeman has clearly melted under Rusty's campy tutelage. 
''Flawless'' means well, heaven knows. But its caricatures of the transvestized and the transgendered (Rusty, who is saving money to have a sex-change operation fits both definitions) reinforces every negative stereotype ascribed to gay men in drag. Rusty is hysterical, masochistic, voracious, self-loathing and ragingly ''on'' every minute of her waking day. Her noisy posse of friends look and act like shallow, preening gargoyles revving up for a never-ending Halloween drag ball. They are about as real as Broadway's ''Cats.'' 
Desperate for sharp one-liners, the screenplay recycles cliches, then tries to palm them off as fresh. ''There's no romance without finance,'' Rusty remarks, when explaining her relationship with a macho married man who abuses her but expects her to pay his gambling debts. When Rusty gets angry at Walt, she hits him with that now-standard refrain, ''I'm more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get.'' 
Meanwhile Walt learns some lessons about romance and finance from two women he knows from the local tango palace. The one he has admired as a lady turns out to be a mercenary who dumps him when he is disabled and strapped for cash, while the one he has dismissed as a whore turns out to have a heart of gold. 
Mr. De Niro brings a deep, brooding quiet to his role that makes Walt more than a stick-figure bigot. The actor makes you feel the humiliation and terror of a proudly independent man who suddenly must relearn how to speak while facing the possibility of having no sexual future. Mr. Hoffman brings an angry heat to a stunt role that is even flashier than his turns in ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Happiness.'' Unlike Mr. De Niro, he makes you aware every second that he is giving a carefully shaped, larger-than-life performance. It's probably the only way an actor could have approached a role that feels like a hollow construction crammed with the filmmaker's unexamined emotional baggage. 
''Flawless'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The profanity is nonstop.

‽End of Days‽,‽In ''End of Days,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger assumes the cruciform position in a church as he modestly tackles the role of Jericho Cane, someone who could keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years. ''This is as pro-religious a movie as you can make,'' the film's director, Peter Hyams, recently told Variety. ''This is about the biggest action star of the past 20 years putting the gun down and saying the only thing that works is faith.'' What that statement overlooks is that it takes two ridiculous blood-soaked hours for Mr. Schwarzenegger to part company with his weapon. 
Like a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic action films, ''End of Days'' presents Jericho as a near-suicidal (''Lethal Weapon'') ex-cop. Its idea of a subtle character flourish is giving him a ballerina music box, which makes him think sadly of his wife and daughter. They were killed because he was too busy to be home much, but by-the-numbers Hollywood screenwriting has ways to assuage such guilt. Jericho will be given a second chance: he can try to save Christine York (Robin Tunney) from becoming the mother of Satan's child (''Rosemary's Baby''). 
Gabriel Byrne, who has a much snappier role, plays Satan with an evil grin and a slick corporate edge (''Devil's Advocate''). Actually, Mr. Byrne merely plays an investment banker who happens to be overtaken by Satan in the men's room of a restaurant. The essence of evil, which looks like throbbing plexiglass with attitude (''Predator''), enters the banker's body with a great show of demonic possession (''The Exorcist''). Once a nice guy, the banker returns to the dining room, walks over to a woman in a low-cut dress and simply grabs her breast. Then he kisses her, and she enjoys it. The episode may not say much about Satanism. But it does indicate something about the guys who made this movie. 
It turns out that Satan must mate with Christine before New Year's Eve 1999, and that a battle royal is being waged over Christine's future. In one of the film's earliest and kookiest scenes, the infant Christine was whisked from the maternity ward to the morgue and suckled with snake's blood while Satanists prayed in Latin. Since then she has been carefully watched by a stepmother. The stepmother at least has a chance to slug Mr. Schwarzenegger when the action gets going. 
''End of Days,'' which is as incoherent about its mysticism as it is about anything else, interrupts stretches of doomsday exposition with the inevitable chases and shootouts and beatings that are its raison d'etre. One character tears out his own tongue, keeps it in a jar, and eventually winds up crucified on the ceiling of a hospital room. These are the kinds of hints that persuade Jericho of the urgency of his mission. 
With Kevin Pollak as his wisecracking sidekick, Mr. Schwarzenegger eventually cuts through the religious forces on either side of him and begins to deliver a mean-spirited quip or two. (''I'm not afraid to die,'' says his enemy. ''Good,'' says the star, ''because I'm not afraid to kill you.'') Looking trim and rested in his first film since ''Batman and Robin,'' he moves confidently from crisis to crisis, but can't get past much of the sheer absurdity here. It is no longer possible to believe in special-effects shots that show him hanging one-handed from a very tall building, for instance. As for the film's millennial pretensions, they don't amount to much more than billboards reading ''NY2K Where Will You Be?'' A possible answer, to cite one of numerous better movies around: anywhere but here. 
''End of Days'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violent, grisly scenes, some involving religious imagery, and brief, bizarre sexual situations.

‽A Force More Powerful‽,‽One of the most stunning images from Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, ''Gandhi,'' is the line upon line upon line of protesters standing up to British oppression by lying down, or allowing themselves to be knocked down. What Gandhi did was undeniably momentous. He invented and taught passive resistance based on the Hindu concept of satyagraha, the assertion of truth through firmness and patience, and as a result won India its independence. Luckily, early-20th-century movie cameras were around to record much of it. 
The cinematic possibilities in Gandhi's accomplishment make it all the sadder that ''A Force More Powerful,'' a documentary about nonviolent protest written, directed and produced by Steve York, has taken such a formal approach. The film, which opens today at the Screening Room, conveys valuable information, but with the imagination and liveliness of a high school history lecture. 
Moviegoers will learn dates and the names of some true unsung heroes, but in unmemorable ways. Even the screen titles are academic: ''I. India,'' ''II. Nashville, Tenn.'' and ''III. South Africa.'' 
''Nashville,'' the best-told story, introduces the Rev. James Lawson Jr., a young Methodist minister who worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Lawson taught the principles of passive resistance to young black people in Tennessee in preparation for the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960. The film of their rehearsals and of the sit-ins is fascinating, as is a brief early appearance by Dr. King on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. 
The relatively unknown hero of South Africa's victory over apartheid is Mkhuseli Jack, who led consumer boycotts beginning in 1985. Gandhi's story began in Africa too, where he lived from the early 1890's to 1914. When he staged peaceful protests there, Jan Smuts, then the country's interior minister, told him: ''You reduce me to helplessness. How can we lay hands on you without looking like villains?'' 
That was the point, of course, and the method continues to work miracles.

‽
‽Sleepy Hollow‽,‽The year is 1799 and ''the millennium is almost upon us,'' according to the newly dashing Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's enthusiastically bleak new movie. And speaking of dashing, when Ichabod gallops north from New York City, he rides up the west bank of the Hudson River although the village of Sleepy Hollow is on the east. But an ornate visual fantasy of Mr. Burton's can be expected to make its own rules, and ''Sleepy Hollow'' does that with macabre gusto. His idea of a beautiful day may be somebody else's nuclear winter, but Mr. Burton eagerly brings his visions of sugarplums to the screen. 
So when it comes to appearances, this dark, shivery ''Sleepy Hollow'' manages to be as distinctively Burtonesque as ''Edward Scissorhands'' or ''Batman.''  Offering a serenely unrecognizable take on Washington Irving's story and its famously unlucky schoolteacher, the film brings its huge reserves of creativity to bear upon matters like the severing of heads. Quaint Dutch burghers of the Hudson Valley could have bowled ninepins throughout Rip Van Winkle's sleep-in with the supply of decapitated heads sent flying here, even if Mr. Burton handles such sequences with his own brand of wit. Shot 1: Sword approaches victim. Shot 2: Blood splashes Ichabod's glasses. Shot 3: Head rolls away.  Shot 4: Body pitches forward. Pause for laugh. 
History will recognize the rich imagination and secret tenderness of Mr. Burton's best films. (From a purely technical standpoint, as in the award-ready cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, this grimly voluptuous ''Sleepy Hollow'' must be one of them.) But it will also raise the question of what we were smoking during this period of infatuation with grisliness on screen. It is not unreasonable to admire Mr. Burton immensely without wanting to peer at the exposed brain stems of  his characters, but ''Sleepy Hollow'' leaves no choice. As written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who took off Gwyneth Paltrow's head in ''Seven'' and apparently considered that small potatoes, ''Sleepy Hollow'' turns the tale of the Headless Horseman into the pre-tabloid story of a rampaging serial killer. 
There are reasons to be troubled by this, and they aren't about squeamishness. Mr. Walker's credits also include ''Fight Club,'' a genuinely daring effort to make sense of the violent impulses of buttoned-down young men, and to plumb those dangers found at the nexus of popular culture and political fanaticism.  That, at least, had the hallmarks of something different, and it involved a much lower body count than the one racked up by the Headless Horseman. But ''Sleepy Hollow,'' in the guise of an exotic fable and horror-film homage, offers little such ballast. For all its visual cleverness, it's much more conventionally conceived than Mr. Burton's admirers would expect. 
Even birds nesting in one of the film's vast, wintry indoor sets found themselves trying to get away, moving into the only blossom-filled backdrop that ''Sleepy Hollow'' uses (for brief fantasy scenes). But the bulk of the film unfolds in a forbidding, fairy-tale village and forest that are as ambitious as the Gotham City of ''Batman.'' It is here that Ichabod, who now has a faintly English accent and Mr. Depp's playful charisma, is sent to solve a series of murders and to find that everyone in Sleepy Hollow looks mildly suspect. It is also here that he learns of the vengeful headless Hessian (Christopher Walken in redundant fright makeup)  who is the town's main tourist attraction. 
Using a color palette more often associated with stories of the gulag, ''Sleepy Hollow'' creates a landscape so daunting that even a large tree bleeds. At moments like the one revealing the tree's bloody secret, and in a couple of incidents involving witchcraft, Mr. Burton's film delivers a scare or two, but most of it is too tongue in cheek for that. As this film's Ichabod conducts a Holmesian murder investigation and even unearths a village conspiracy, he has much better luck with Katrina Van Tassel than any traditional Ichabod ever did. Katrina is played photogenically by Christina Ricci, who gets through the film gamely while remaining very much a sardonic creature of her own time. 
An impressive cast shows off Colleen Atwood's sumptuous costumes and delivers dialogue, some apparently worked on by Tom Stoppard, sometimes graced with a clever edge. Miranda Richardson swishes dangerously through the proceedings as Katrina's obviously wicked stepmother, while the town elders include Michael Gough, Michael Gambon and Jeffrey Jones. The horror patriarch Christopher Lee is here, as well he ought to be. And Marc Pickering plays the teenage sidekick whom Ichabod cautions, as he might the audience, with ''I hope you have a strong stomach.'' 
Among the many scenes of cheeky mayhem, one finds a little boy cowering beneath floorboards while the Horseman harvests the heads of his parents. In case you were thinking of  taking the children. 
''Sleepy Hollow'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes fanciful gore and violence, brief sexual situations and a high head count.

‽Mansfield Park‽,‽''My God, this is 1806, for heaven's sake!'' a character exclaims in ''Mansfield Park,'' Patricia Rozema's smart, politically pointed screen adaptation of Jane Austen's third novel. This reminder of how every age foolishly fancies itself the most progressive and enlightened in the history of the world is drenched in irony. And it speaks to the heart of a film that is determined to invest Austen with as many prickly contemporary resonances as it can shoehorn in without appearing wildly anachronistic. 
''Mansfield Park'' takes special pains to remind us that the glory of the British empire and the comfortable life of the novel's landed gentry were the products of colonial exploitation. Where the novel alludes to the slave trading business of Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), the pompous authoritarian who owns the estate called Mansfield Park, the movie rubs our faces in his dirty business. 
The novel's rather meek central character, Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), has been retooled and pumped up for the film into a spunky Jane Austen stand-in who recites directly to the camera fragments from Austen's letters and diaries. The movie's Fanny is an ambitious, willful writer from a poor background whose unstoppable intellectual drive is synonymous with her integrity. Her categorical rejection of Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), a wealthy aristocratic dreamboat whom Sir Thomas insists she marry, marks her as a proto-feminist heroine who risks losing everything by standing up to male authority. 
Other modern touches include blatant drug addiction and hints of lesbianism. Sir Thomas's wife, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan), is a bleary-eyed, nodding-out junkie in the thrall of the opiate laudanum. Fanny's friendship with Henry's sophisticated, scheming sister, Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who looks so much like Fanny she could almost be her twin, has a strong lesbian undercurrent, and in one scene the two women narrowly avoid falling into a passionate kiss. In another scene (not in the novel), Fanny discovers Henry in bed with someone else's wife. Fanny, although suitably appalled, appears to know enough about the birds and the bees not to require smelling salts after barging in on the pair in full sexual gallop. 
In the hands of a less talented filmmaker, this extensive tinkering and modernizing might seem irritating and pretentious. But in peering beneath Austen's genteel surfaces and scraping away the Hollywood gloss that traditionally accrues to screen adaptations of Austen, Ms. Rozema has made a film whose satiric bite is sharper than that of the usual high-toned romantic costume drama. 
Accentuating the aspects of ''Mansfield Park'' that lend it the aura of a feminist fable about women, power and money, Ms. Rozema turns it into the story of a clever, willful woman who grits her teeth and, in a reckless gamble, evades the dictates of an oppressive patriarchal society. One of the chief obstacles to Fanny's self-fulfillment is her poverty. Sent by her poor family in Portsmouth to live with wealthy relatives in Mansfield Park, she is treated like a servant and told that her lack of means has made her an unlikely candidate for a good marriage. The autocratic Sir Thomas, who rules the palace, ignores Fanny until she matures into a pretty young thing, at which point he can barely keep his hands off her. 
One element of the story Ms. Rozema hasn't updated is Fanny's abiding love for Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), Sir Thomas's goody-goody bookworm of a younger son, who forgoes the family business to become a clergyman. In keeping with 19th-century romantic convention, it isn't until the very end that Edmund comes to his senses and realizes that Fanny (and not Mary, who in one startling scene reveals herself to be a kind of period Joan Collins character) is the love of his life. 
The film's portrayal of early-19th-century affluence is notably more austere than in other film adaptations of Austen, which surround the characters in ruffles and flourishes. Mansfield Park is an imposing but sparsely accommodated palace whose overall grimness mirrors the constricting puritanical morality of English society and Fanny's prisonlike confinement within social convention. Casting Ms. Duncan in the dual roles of Fanny's impoverished mother (who married for love and ended up in desperate straits) and her well-to-do but drug-addicted aunt, Lady Bertram, suggests the harsh choices forced on women in those days. 
The absence of frilly decor also allows the director to concentrate on the characters. Ms. O'Connor's likable Fanny suggests a quick-witted, wised-up 90's version of a 1940's Jennifer Jones heroine. Biting his lips and looking alternately sheepish and pious, Mr. Miller reins in his swashbuckling energy to make a credibly humble Edmund. Mr. Nivola's Henry conveys the pouting narcissism lurking just beneath a surface charm. But the movie's most imposing performance is Mr. Pinter's thunderous Sir Bertram. A quintessential 19th-century English patriarch, he is the embodiment of an overweening male authority, which the upstart Fanny and subsequent generations of rebellious women feel impelled to disobey. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.

‽Liberty Heights‽,‽Baltimore has been awfully good to Barry Levinson. Whenever this gifted filmmaker seems in danger of succumbing to Hollywood's schlockiest temptations, he dips  back into the personal memory bank of his Baltimore boyhood and comes up with something sweet and heartfelt. In ''Liberty Heights,'' his fourth Baltimore-based film, Mr. Levinson pores over the social traumas and cultural trivia of 1950's America as reflected in his native city with the concentration of a diehard nostalgist minutely inspecting the still-visible scars of his own hypersensitive adolescence. 
In remembering the virulent anti-Semitism and racism of Baltimore in the mid-1950's, this warmly sentimental, sometimes very funny film subscribes to the notion propagated by countless other movies, television shows and rock 'n' roll histories that America was more or less born in the mid-1950's; before that were the dark ages. And in a way it's true. With the rise of television, rock 'n' roll and the teenage car culture, the  shell of America's devouring pop fun house was already in place by 1954, the year  'Liberty Heights'' begins. 
The obvious problems facing any movie revisiting such familiar territory are finding a fresh point of view and coming up with characters who transcend the pre-''Happy Days'' teenage stereotypes we know too well. The strategy of ''Liberty Heights'' is to build an atmosphere that is so intensely true to the period that you can't help but dream its dreams and be caught up in its tensions. 
''Liberty Heights'' remembers this era through the eyes of two brothers, teenage Ben (Ben Foster) and the slightly older Van (Adrien Brody), growing up in a middle-class Jewish family in the mostly Jewish northwest section of Baltimore. The most irritating symbol of their uncertain status in a gentile-dominated world is a country club with a posted sign at the entrance reading  ''No Jews, dogs or coloreds allowed.'' The boys' father, Nate (Joe Mantegna), runs a discreet numbers racket and operates a burlesque house with two partners. And some of the movie's wittiest moments recreate pieces of vintage burlesque skits. Their mother, Ada (Bebe Neuwirth), is tight-lipped, puritanical and devoted to her husband. A meddlesome but good-hearted grandmother is also on the premises. 
Much as Mr. Levinson's 1982 film ''Diner'' did, ''Liberty Heights'' focuses on the boys' fumbling rites of passage, but here the time is two or three years earlier. Again, Mr. Levinson shows a special knack for capturing the boastful, clinging camaraderie and cultural fetishes of innocents trying to invent themselves in a more restrictive era. Masking their anxiety in foolish braggadocio and speculation, they swap apocryphal sexual lore while pining after forbiddingly unattainable goddesses. 
Ben develops a crush on Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), a sensible, well-mannered middle-class black girl in his high school, and the pair sneak out on a chaste date in which she instructs him to huddle below the front seat of the car so they won't be seen together. Van pines for Dubbie (Carolyn Murphy), a haughty horseback-riding debutante he meets at a Halloween party where she is dressed as a fairy princess waving a wand. 
''Liberty Heights'' is a leisurely paced series of anecdotes that jump from character to character to create the sense of a society in accelerating flux. The most dramatic sequence crosscuts from a James Brown concert at which Ben discovers the thrill of soul music to a high-toned teenage society bash attended by an anxious Van searching for his dream girl. 
The movie has some lovely comic touches. Ben, whose voice-over narration frames the story, is astounded to discover the existence of a gentile world where people consume bread that isn't toasted. In another scene, a friend of Van's, visiting an elegant WASP manor with lavishly furnished antiques and expensive rugs, naively assumes that a family that can't afford wall-to-wall carpeting and Formica tables must be poor or very stingy. 
''Liberty Heights'' pointedly compares anti-Semitism with the far more severe prejudice against blacks, who are shunned by WASPS and Jews alike in mid-1950's Baltimore. 
In the most serious plot turn, Nate and his partners come up with a promising new twist on their numbers racket, which backfires when Little Melvin (Orlando Jones), a black drug dealer who has placed 50-to-1 odds on a number that carries a bonus, unexpectedly wins $100,000. Lacking the money to pay the prize, Nate is forced to bargain with Little Melvin, with disastrous consequences for Nate and his family. 
But because ''Liberty Heights'' looks back through Ben's and Van's youthful eyes, even the harshest turn of events wears a misty nostalgic glow. The family dynamics remain unexplored, as do the darker aspects of Nate's profession. Mr. Mantegna's Nate is a model father, husband and breadwinner who just happens to be operating outside the law. His sons are just as lovingly drawn. Mr. Foster's Ben is a likable all-American boy who even when rebelling (one Halloween he dresses up like Hitler) is essentially sweet-natured and pliable. Mr. Brody's Van is surprisingly soft-edged, given the hopped-up energy that the actor effuses almost like perspiration. 
But if ''Liberty Heights'' is much too soft at its center, it still offers a deeper immersion in that old 50's feeling than any other Hollywood film in recent memory. As its inviting period soundtrack fills in the background and its youthful characters lurch through their pseudo-sophisticated rituals of rebellion and desire, the gawky sincerity of an earlier era comes stumbling back, a little tipsy and poignantly alive. 
''Liberty Heights'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, a glimpse of nudity and some strong language.

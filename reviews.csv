‽A Chronicle of Corpses‽,‽Here's a real UFO, an extremely low-budget, genuinely independent film by a 22-year-old writer-director from Philadelphia that immediately establishes a distinctive and promising voice. 
Andrew Repasky McElhinney's ''Chronicle of Corpses'' is a gothic horror tale set in the early 19th century on the grounds of a dying slave plantation somewhere in the Middle Atlantic states. Though once the center of a thriving economy, the plantation has degenerated into inertia and neglect, largely as a result of the deepening decadence of its ruling family, the Elliots. 
Grandmother (Marj Dusay, of the soap ''All My Children'') has retreated into wordless dementia, leaving the family affairs in the hands of assorted offspring and in-laws, most of whom have serious problems with drinking and sex. There are a priest (Jerry Perna) still on retainer, a saucy young Irish servant (Margot White) who preserves what's left of the plantation's rapidly dimming life force, and the family's youngest member, Sara (Ryan Foley), a haunted teenager, who together represent what resistance there is to the dark forces gathering both inside the family and outside the house. 
Something strange and possibly supernatural is rampaging through the woods around the Elliot compound, selecting its victims at random and destroying them in assorted awful ways. Mr. McElhinney is careful not to overdefine his metaphors: the monster represents at once the waning of a singularly unjust period of American history and the manifestation of a particular disease infecting American families. 
Shooting on 16-millimeter film and using a cast drawn largely from local theater groups, Mr. McElhinney has created a movie that is not without the flaws endemic in low-budget productions but still projects an amazing degree of stylistic assurance and originality. 
Unlike most of today's indie directors, he shows no interest in jittery, hand-held compositions. His film consists of strongly framed long shots in which the characters speak largely in mumbling monotones while remaining motionless, a style that recalls at once the deliberately zomboid acting of Edgar G. Ulmer's grade-Z classics of the 1940's (''Detour,'' ''Strange Illusion'') and the Brechtian alienation techniques of experimental European filmmakers like Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet. The film takes on a hushed, ritualized tone as the bodies begin to pile up, and the family confines itself more and more to the plantation's chapel. 
Mr. McElhinney is obviously an experienced cinephile (he is also the programmer of a long-running film society in Philadelphia, the Chestnut Hill Film Group), but his film doesn't drown in show-offy references to old movies. It is more a case of an antique aesthetic absorbed and revived. 
Though the technology is no longer available to create the kind of stately, formal tracking shots that Ulmer specialized in, Mr. McElhinney and his cinematographer, Abe Holtz, have been able to recreate the dreamy, fateful sense of those shots by using a Steadycam mount. 
''A Chronicle of Corpses'' belongs to the small but significant tradition of outsider art in American movies -- films like Herk Harvey's ''Carnival of Souls'' or George Romero's ''Night of the Living Dead'' -- that reflect powerful personalities formed outside any academic or professional tradition. That most of these are horror films is no coincidence; they are the films that haunt American cinema, pointing to paths that were never taken, to doors that remain firmly closed.

‽
‽Hamlet‽,‽If any contemporary American actor was born to play the melancholy Dane in Shakespeare's ''Hamlet,'' it is Campbell Scott, who conveys a smoldering intelligence softened by a residual tenderness. These qualities are embodied not only in Mr. Campbell's haunted eyes and sunken lips but also in a rich musical voice whose oratorical roll enfolds many quivering notes, including several shades of hysteria. 
Mr. Scott has portrayed Hamlet twice onstage, in 1990 at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego and in 1996 at the Huntington Theater in Boston. This second production, directed by Eric Simonson, was filmed for television, with Mr. Scott as co-director; it played last year on the Odyssey Channel and is opening today at the Screening Room. Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen. It is, in a word, compelling. 
The actor, who looks a good decade younger than his 39 years, portrays Hamlet as an excitable, overprotected youth whose idealism is abruptly shattered with a single traumatic revelation. Forced to grow up and recognize the evil of the world, he alternates between a near-suicidal despair and an adolescent rage that drives him to try to right all the wrong he sees. Once embarked on his vengeful path, he is seized with brainstorms so intense they drive him to the brink of insanity, which he is smart enough to recognize but nearly powerless to control. 
Mr. Scott's Hamlet is very American without being at all colloquial. His interpretation is so clearly conceived that you can read Hamlet's thoughts from moment to moment. The essence of his performance is embodied in his ''To be or not to be'' speech, which he delivers after smashing his own eyeglasses and cutting his arm with a shard. Fighting back the impulse toward self-destruction, he sinks to the floor and delivers the soliloquy lying down in an intense, agitated murmur. Even at his most maniacal, Mr. Scott's Hamlet remains sympathetic, the only voice of truth in a climate poisoned by lies. He is the incarnation of frantic, anguished sincerity. 
The movie is set in a post-Civil War America that vaguely suggests the South without being specific as to location. There is a cannon on the front lawn. And when the royals go outside to frolic, you can imagine them sipping juleps and toasting the memory of Robert E. Lee. The grandeur of the palatial mansion in which the action unfolds and the overripe lushness of the surrounding trees and lawns suggest a Southern aristocracy decaying beneath a proudly noble facade. 
The choice of black actors to play Polonius (Roscoe Lee Browne), Ophelia (LisaGay Hamilton) and Laertes (Roger Guenveur Smith) also suggests the remnants of a plantation culture. Moreover, it astutely underscores their family ties and a subservience to the royal family that make Laertes's outrage all the more sympathetic once his father and sister have died. Although Ms. Hamilton's somewhat tough Ophelia goes against the character's traditionally fragile grain, her descent into madness stays reasonably credible. 
But the movie's Southern flavor remains just a suggestion. None of the characters have Southern accents. 
Blair Brown, an actress of enormous subtlety and depth whose work grows richer every year, is as complex a Gertrude as I have seen. An aristocratic woman of a certain age, hypnotized by Claudius's power (sexual and otherwise), she glides through much of the film in a smiling trance, aglow with passion but almost visibly trembling underneath. When Hamlet confronts her with a murderous truth she is terrified to face, she is furious at being snapped out of her self-protective trance for even a second. For a change, there are no suggestions of an incestuous love. As Claudius, Jamey Sheridan, whose medal-encrusted uniform suggests Virginia military gentry, is a suavely beady-eyed fascist and pragmatic authoritarian, at once magnetic and chilling. 
The three-hour film devotes special care to the smaller roles, including the gravediggers and the players, each of whom has a distinctively vivid personality. As portrayed by Michael Imperioli and Marcus Giamatti, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are polar opposites. Mr. Imperioli's Rosencrantz is a stiff, frightened toady to Mr. Giamatti's cool, wily fixer. These small, meticulous touches enrich the film immensely. 
But the movie belongs to Mr. Scott, whose performance so dominates (the many close-ups almost take us inside Hamlet's head) that even more than usual we see the events in a rotting Denmark through his aggrieved eyes. At the same time, the film's American setting and its studious evocation of a formal hierarchy where secrecy and paranoia run rampant remind you that the story isn't just about Denmark way back when. It could be a portrait of any seat of power where authority has been wrested through murder and ruthless suppression.

‽On Hostile Ground‽,‽Directed by Liz Mermin and Jenny Raskin 
Not rated; 73 minutes 
The Hollywood films of the last 20 years have made us think of heroes as otherworldly figures, either absurdly pumped-up caricatures of masculinity (from Russell Crowe in ''Gladiator'' to Arnold Schwarzenegger in anything) or characters, like Julia Roberts's Erin Brockovich, who are so aggressively ordinary that they end by seeming wildly exotic. 
''On Hostile Ground,'' a video documentary produced by Liz Merman, Jenny Raskin and Catherine Gund, goes looking for heroes in the real world and finds three extraordinary individuals who put their lives on the line daily, motivated purely by their commitment to a cause. 
They are two doctors and a physician's assistant who perform abortions in parts of the country where to do so is to attract physically and verbally aggressive protesters, fire-bombers and even assassins. 
They are Richard Stuntz, a 76-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who lives in Baltimore but spends three days a week working in clinics in Alabama; Susan Cahill, a certified physician's assistant whose clinic in Montana was destroyed by an arsonist in 1993; and Morris Wortman, an outspoken gynecologist whose office is in Rochester. 
Abortion may still be legal in these communities, but as the director of a Montgomery, Ala., clinic observes, ''It might as well be illegal'' whre no professionals are willing or able to perform the service. Dr. Stuntz has a bulletproof vest but prefers not to wear it because it affects his pacemaker; instead, he relies on his cell phone to learn which routes are safe to take from the airport to the clinics. 
In the interview sequences, the filmmakers do their best to uncover the motivations of these three everyday risk-takers: Dr. Stuntz, the son of Methodist missionaries, operates from a quiet, self-effacing idealism. Ms. Cahill will venture only that ''providing abortions is part of taking care of families.'' Only the flamboyant Dr. Wortman offers a psychological explanation for his actions: his parents were Holocaust survivors, and he feels the need to take a firm stand in his life. 
While much of the film seems amateurishly shot, it has been edited into a highly professional presentation, one that smoothly intertwines the three stories and builds to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. 
''On Hostile Ground,'' which opens today at the Screening Room (54 Varick Street, TriBeCa), is unabashedly in favor of abortion rights. But the filmmakers do have the grace to include a brief glimpse of one protester in Rochester who appears neither violent nor fanatical. Instead, she seems to be acting from a personal conviction as deep and sincere as that of the film's three protagonists.   DAVE KEHR 
‽
‽All the Pretty Horses‽,‽John Grady Cole, the noble young cowboy played by Matt Damon in ''All the Pretty Horses,'' says that life boils down to a simple choice: ''stick or quit.'' ''How I was is how I am, and all I know is to stick,'' he tells his boon companion, Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas). 
Billy Bob Thornton and Ted Tally, the director and screenwriter, respectively, of this big, slow, western, have certainly stuck close to their source, Cormac McCarthy's beloved National Book Award-winning novel of 1992. Virtually all the dialogue in the movie -- in Spanish, in twangy cowboyese and in the strangely stilted version of English that seems to be the native idiom of the Mexican ruling class -- has been carefully transferred from the pages of the book. 
The details of the story of John Grady's ill-starred romance with a Mexican landowner's daughter have also been reproduced with respectful care. But the movie, for all its prettiness, manages to be shallow and portentous at the same time. The material to which Mr. Thornton and Mr. Tally have been so ardently faithful has betrayed them. The wiser course may have been to quit. 
Mr. McCarthy's admirers cherish ''All the Pretty Horses,'' the first volume in a trilogy that also includes ''The Crossing'' and ''Cities of the Plain,'' for its manly, lyrical prose and its deep thoughts on the relations between man and nature, man and woman, and man and horse. 
The filmmakers have wisely resisted the temptation to incorporate Mr. McCarthy's high literary style into the picture or to seek out its visual equivalent. Unfortunately, the story, shorn of its philosophical pretensions and fancy writing, turns out to be thin and banal. 
''All the Pretty Horses'' looks like a real old-fashioned western and tries to revive sturdy horse-opera themes of love, friendship and righteous violence. But in spite of some thoughtful performances and a handsome sense of scale, the picture is, for the most part, as slick and superficial as a Marlboro advertisement on the back of a glossy magazine. It alludes to the mythology of the American West without engaging it and supplies a series of picturesque landscapes and grandiose gestures utterly lacking in narrative momentum or emotional resonance. 
Even Barry Markowitz's gorgeous cinematography and Marty Stuart's eclectic score work to undermine rather than complement each other. The music, a tasteful blend of mariachi, norteno and western swing (among other things), covers the movie like wall-to-wall carpeting. Once or twice, it would be good to contemplate the vastness of the desert landscape in silence. 
In essence ''All the Pretty Horses'' is a boy's adventure story that has mistaken itself for an epic, and it rattles around in its own ambitions like a child's head in a 10-gallon hat. It's somewhat fitting, then, that the liveliest and most interesting character should be a child, a stripling named Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black), who joins Lacey and John Grady on their trek across the Texas border into Mexico. 
John Grady has been set adrift by his parents' divorce and his mother's inconsiderate sale of the family homestead. Lacey, his best friend, is the designated sidekick, while Blevins, a prepubescent hothead with a foul mouth and a marksman's eye, has stolen his stepfather's horse and, like a manic Huck Finn, lit out for the territories. 
Mr. Black's fine performance, with its combination of boisterousness and vulnerability, gives the movie a touch of humor and unpredictability it sorely needs. When Blevins's mischievous bluster lands him in morally serious trouble, the film finds its only genuine moment of strong feeling. 
In contrast, the grand passion that develops between John Grady and Alejandra (Penelope Cruz), whose father owns the hacienda on which the two vagabonds find work, is like an Archie Comics version of ''A Place in the Sun.'' The lovers exchange smoldering glances as they pass on horseback, and soon enough Alejandra is sneaking into John Grady's quarters for a bit of discreet montage. 
Alejandra's disapproving aunt, who seems to have wandered in from an Edith Wharton telenovela, gets wind of the affair and subjects John Grady to a series of lectures in philosophy (''It is not a matter of right, but a matter of who must say'') before shipping him, along with poor Lacey, off to jail. 
Ms. Cruz and Mr. Damon are certainly a nice-looking pair, but the film's treatment of their characters' relationship is so stylized and detached that no spark of genuine longing ever ignites between them. Poor Ms. Cruz must utter some of the corniest woman-in-love lines this side of ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' and, to put it as kindly as possible, she's no Meryl Streep. Mr. Damon does a bit better, but John Grady's chivalric goodness smothers the streak of bad-boy spontaneity that is his most appealing trait. 
The great westerns of the 1940's and 50's were rich with subtext, full of psychosexual implication and political anxiety. ''All the Pretty Horses,'' which is set in 1949, strips away such complexity. 
Its view of the difference between Texas and Mexico is as schematic as its ideas about men and women. The northern side of the Rio Grande is a place of law and justice, as embodied by a kindly judge (Bruce Dern), who comes to John Grady's aid at the end. The mysterious land south of the border, on the other hand, is ruled by the arbitrary and corrupt exercise of power, represented by a sinister police captain and that meddling aunt. This would be bothersome, or possibly even interesting, if the movie were not so abstract and complacent, if it had a thought, that is, in its pretty little head. 
''All the Pretty Horses'' is rated PG-13. It has some cowboy cussing, a few scenes of violence and some heavy-breathing, but not terribly explicit, bedroom moments. 
‽
‽Cast Away‽,‽WHICH of us, while sitting at the edge of the ocean and gazing toward the horizon, hasn't shivered to imagine being drawn out to sea, getting lost and ending up a tiny forgotten speck in the middle of nowhere, shouting at the sky? As potentially panic-inducing as this vision may be, there's also something alluring about it. It's like standing on the edge of a cliff and imagining that fatal leap into the unknown. And in the heart-stopping ocean and desert-island scenes that constitute the core of ''Cast Away,'' Tom Hanks, in collaboration with the director Robert Zemeckis and the screenwriter William Broyles Jr., bring those visions thrillingly and hauntingly to life. 
With a bravura mastery of tone and timing, ''Cast Away'' sweeps us out to sea and washes us ashore on a tiny deserted island in the Pacific. We remain stranded there just long enough to be given a deep, salty gulp of what it's like to have to restart civilization from scratch. Just in time for dinner, however, we're whisked back to safety and to tables piled high with supermarket goodies and a life that oddly and sadly seems banal and superfluous compared to what has gone before. 
When ''Cast Away'' is the farthest from civilization, it is as compelling a cinematic adventure as any Hollywood has produced. Back on the mainland, however, it turns more formulaic and corny. But even in the wobbly narrative bookends that hold a love story, interrupted by disaster, there are flashes of a deeper metaphysical poignancy. At its best, ''Cast Away,'' like ''Titanic,'' awes us with its sheer oceanic sweep and its cosmic apprehension of human insignificance. 
The center of the film is an unforgettably gripping, heart-in-your-throat evocation of the unbearable loneliness and terror of ultimate abandonment once its hero, stranded and presumed dead, gives up hope of being rescued but still clings tenaciously to life. 
In one of the script's pointed paradoxes, this modern-day Robinson Crusoe, Chuck Noland (Mr. Hanks), is a voluble, time-obsessed efficiency expert for Federal Express. Shortly before boarding a plane that plunges him into the Pacific, he and his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), exchange gifts: an engagement ring from Chuck, her grandfather's pocket watch (with her picture inside) from Kelly. Marooned with only the timepiece to remind him of home, Chuck finds himself facing only one deadline, the race to survive in the face of  starvation, dehydration and natural disaster. 
''Cast Away'' is everything this year's other man-against-nature blockbuster, ''The Perfect Storm,'' was not. The earlier film huffed and puffed to evoke a similarly elemental struggle in the traditional Hollywood ways, with strenuously grandiose music and oversize, patently unrealistic computer-generated special effects. ''Cast Away'' also has its quotient of technological trickery, but one of the movie's wonders is that everything looks and feels so remarkably real. And it never pushes us too hard. 
It also knows when to turn down the volume. The most devastating sequences, instead of flooding us with music, suspend the soundtrack and forgo even language to allow the sounds of nature to take over. All we hear from Mr. Hanks are the grunts and howls of a man exerting himself to stay alive against a backdrop of the roaring ocean and the wind eerily whistling outside the cave Chuck adopts as a shelter. Ultimate isolation, the movie reminds us, doesn't have a soundtrack except what the environment churns up along with the ringing in our ears, our heartbeats and the voices chattering in our minds. 
Once again, Mr. Hanks portrays a spirited Everyman, at once deeply likable and profoundly ordinary. If his wound-up, globe-trotting character, who early in the film is shown haranguing Russian employees at a FedEx depot in Moscow, isn't exactly like you and me in his background and tastes (he happens to be an Elvis Presley fanatic), he embodies enough parts of other people to be utterly recognizable. 
Mr. Hanks's likability has everything to do with the ease with which he pours the childlike side of himself into his performances. Even at moments of maximum stress, the qualities that shine through are an infectious spontaneity, curiosity, ebullience and native optimism, along with an instinctive common-sense resourcefulness. 
The screenplay's conceptual master stroke has Chuck revert to childhood through the creation of an imaginary companion so he can survive psychically. Painting a face (in his own blood) on a white Wilson volleyball extracted from a FedEx package that washes up on shore, he turns Wilson (as he calls the ball) into a fellow survivor, confidant and collaborator in an escape plan. Anyone who recalls being a very young child and clutching a doll that embodies comfort and companionship in times of loneliness and insecurity will relate to the wrenching scenes in which Chuck clings to Wilson for emotional support. 
The volleyball is one of many practical uses Chuck is able to make from the washed-up items (many of them Christmas presents) in FedEx packages that at first seem useless but become essential survival tools. A pair of figure skates becomes both a knife and a tool for removing an infected tooth in an excruciating scene of do-it-yourself dentistry. Videotapes become ropes for an escape raft, and the netting in a fancy dress a fishing net. 
''Cast Away'' doesn't begin working its spell until its introductory scenes of its harried hero and his fiancee are out of the way. But once Chuck is aboard a FedEx plane flying over the Pacific, an escalating sense of dread takes over as the aircraft gives a warning shudder. 
What follows is the scariest, most believable plane crash ever filmed as the aircraft begins splitting apart and plummets in a whirling, vertiginous roar amid a violent thunderstorm. It is so real you can almost feel the metal body of the aircraft shaking violently as it is wrenched apart. Crashing into the ocean, Chuck is plunged underwater, his life-preserver narrowly avoiding puncture by a shard on which it is momentarily caught. Rising to the surface, he finds himself surrounded by pieces of the burning aircraft illuminating utter blackness in a furious storm. 
Once Chuck, close to exhaustion, has drifted onto the shore of a tiny tropical island, the movie makes each lesson in survival -- from pounding open a coconut to building a fire from scratch to a first frustrated attempt at an escape -- an agonizing, often bloody, sometimes life-threatening ritual. The world in which he finds himself, a pristine island amid a turquoise sea, is as dazzlingly  beautiful as it is treacherous. 
Finally, after a certain point, the movie fades out and a title informs that four years have passed. In the intervening years, Chuck has metamorphosed into a gaunt, shaggy, nut-brown survivalist, camped in a lair embellished with his own cave drawings. Mr. Hanks lost more than 50 pounds for this section of the film (Mr. Zemeckis completed ''What Lies Beneath'' in the interim), and the actor's physical transformation is as startling (and dramatically effective) as the fattened-up Robert De Niro in the later scenes of ''Raging Bull.'' 
Ultimately ''Cast Away'' has to end somewhere. And because it's a Hollywood movie with an attenuated love story it needs to resolve, it couldn't disintegrate into nothingness. Once Chuck is saved, he appears terminally detached and wears the faraway expression of a man whose traumatic experience has separated him from others. For the rest of his life, we sense, an essential part of him will still be living alone on that island. 
At the same time, Mr. Hanks radiates the inappropriately sleek glow of someone who has just returned from a luxury spa. And though his scenes with Ms. Hunt are well acted (the two really are perfectly matched as a decent Mr. and Ms. American Everyperson), the suds are too thick to be washed away. 
But in these later scenes, the movie also plays with metaphysical uncertainty in effective, recurrent images of an actual crossroads. Because the conflict between romantic convention and the movie's angst is never resolved, ''Cast Away'' leaves us hanging. But that final, lurking ambiguity is a small price to pay for the primal force of what has come before. 
''Cast Away'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

‽The Family Man‽,‽It seems that every few years the studios release movies that seek to offer Christmas magic but end up feeling forlorn and empty. One was ''Trapped in Paradise'' (1994), which starred Nicolas Cage as a former thief trying to reform who ends up trapped in a winter wonderland of a small town with his no-good brothers. That tradition continues: this year the always hard-working Mr. Cage is marooned in a snow-globe fantasyland in ''The Family Man,'' a piece of moldy wax fruit if ever there was one. A few years ago The New Yorker ran a cartoon with the caption ''Donna Karan's Biggest Nightmare''; the drawing featured someone wearing a sweatshirt with DKNJ scrawled across the chest. 
That could be the theme of ''The Family Man,'' in which Mr. Cage as Jack, a man about Manhattan, is pulled out of his world of creature comforts and hurled across the Hudson River into another life and another world. Jack lives like royalty in New York City. He has more Zegna suits in his closets than the designer's Fifth Avenue store carries. He pilots a Ferrari through the streets of Manhattan without ever seeming to hit a red light. Plus he manages to get valet service at his office building: proof positive that he leads a charmed life. 
His life is empty, though. At Christmastime he thinks fondly back to the woman he loved and left behind in 1987. ''I took the road less traveled,'' he says dreamily to his assistant (Mary Beth Hurt). Then he intervenes in a grocery store robbery, and after talking the would-be hold-up man (Don Cheadle) out of a violent act, Jack mentions to him that he has everything. It takes the rest of ''The Family Man'' for him to learn that he doesn't. 
He is magically given a suburban existence by Mr. Cheadle, complete with a temperamental minivan and a wife -- Kate (Tea Leoni), the woman he chose not to return to years earlier -- and two children to go with it. The commercials for the movie play the Talking Heads song ''Once in a Lifetime,'' and you can see the song's lyrics going through Jack's head: this is not my beautiful wife, this is not my beautiful car, this is not my father's Oldsmobile. (It also leaves elements hanging, like Mr. Cheadle's robber, who ends up transforming Jack's life. Taking Clarence the angel from ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and making him a black man with a handgun isn't going to make this movie any more chic.) 
Despite its lumpy cheerlessness, ''The Family Man'' squeezes out a few laughs. Mr. Cage manages to be contemptuous and bewildered at the same time in a performance that's a marvel of modesty. (In a scene in which the well-meaning Kate buys him a knockoff Zegna suit, the millisecond of horror is priceless.) In his new life, Jack is like an emperor without a royal taster, and he can't believe the cluttered, child-friendly house he lives in or the badly fitting clothes or his job. (He manages his father-in-law's tire store.) This holiday season high concept -- a fish out of water under the mistletoe -- is tired but as sturdily engineered as a Volvo. Even though he was a perfectly charming guy with a kind word for everyone when he had it all, Jack has to learn to be unselfish. 
The director, Brett Ratner, is extremely savvy at the opposites-attract buddy comedy, as he proved with ''Money Talks'' and the phenomenal hit ''Rush Hour.'' He is good at using an outsider for laughs, though this film's life-is-fuller-at-the-mall concept is patronizing. Mr. Ratner has pushed his directing up a notch. Despite the cheap jokes, he stages the picture with some sophistication. This is his shift away from action comedy, and he is much more assured here with this tired plot. 
Mr. Ratner can let his actors play things closer to the vest -- they're less harried, with no imminent fireballs behind them -- with the confidence that he can still bring the audience along with him. He made a wise choice in casting Ms. Leoni as Kate. She harvests a world of exasperation out of her responses to Jack's whining, using her cracked, whiskey-sour voice as a foil. It's a small wonder that Jack and Kate's voices become a tiny symphony of complaints; she acts as if she really has been listening to Jack for 13 years. 
In the days before he became highfalutin and said he took the surname Cage as a tribute to the avant-garde composer John Cage, the actor admitted that his last name was a tribute to the comics hero Luke Cage, hero for hire, a blaxploitation-type superhero who wore a yellow silk shirt, black leather pants and a chain as a belt. And in his early days as a performer Nicolas Cage was just such a high-wire act, a hero for hire who was fearless in his utter lack of cynicism, an actor so compelled to express a rollicking inner life that you got the feeling directors didn't know where to look when they were filming him. 
Then he wanted to unleash his soul while the lens was on him; now, with those baleful eyes, he is Huckleberry Hound with a Marin County drawl instead of a down-South accent, and he elongates the words, giving a sardonic performance in which he comments to himself on his new life. 
He is no longer wrestling with himself as an actor; here, his heroism comes from the reined-in precision. His instincts have given way to technique, with every gesture scaled down for the screen. Mr. Cage is a specialist in a unique genre -- the living nightmare comedy -- even though he is no longer as grand an actor. He probably doesn't need to be, but I miss the guy who found pleasure in taking hairpin curves at 180 miles an hour. The Nicolas Cage of 1987 would have run Jack's Ferrari into an underpass. 
He is still unpredictable, even in a movie like ''The Family Man,'' which seems to have been assembled from a kit. Here the star is in a tough position because in each of his existences he thinks the snow is whiter on the other side. There is something missing from his life as a wealthy, driven capitalist, but when he's shoved into a Garden State suburban life, scrambling to make the mortgage payments, he's miserable, too. 
He is probably the only person in theaters running ''The Family Man'' who doesn't realize there may be a clock ticking on his ideal middle-class life. The gift for the man who has everything is nothing, the magic of taking away, and like Jack, ''The Family Man'' doesn't seem to know what it wants for Christmas, which doesn't make for a very satisfying movie. 
There used to be a time when moviemakers didn't ask their audiences to feel pity for the rich; they made fun of them. But in the days of 30's screwball comedy, the plutocrats knew what they had. Even as recently as ''Arthur'' in 1981, probably the last great wealthy-guy comedy, when the multimillionaire Arthur was asked how it felt to have all that money, he smiled and said, ''It feels great.'' 
''The Family Man'' asks us to feel sorry for Mr. Cage's character both when he is rich and when he is part of the middle class, probably because it wants to evoke the same kind of suffering as ''It's a Wonderul Life'' and the film version of ''A Christmas Carol.'' But ''A Christmas Carol'' has always been oversimplified for the screen, and ''Wonderful Life'' is really just a combination of ''A Christmas Carol'' and Jules Romains's novel ''Mort de Quelqu'un,'' in which the suicide of an insignificant common man sends shock waves throughout society. In those stories, there was righteous anger. ''The Family Man'' wants us to feel Jack's pain, but it's a panhandler in a $2,500 suit. 
''The Family Man'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has adult language, mild violence and intense situations.

‽Miss Congeniality‽,‽Midway through ''Miss Congeniality,'' Special Agent Gracie Hart of the F.B.I. (Sandra Bullock) baits her co-worker Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) with a sing-song schoolyard taunt: ''You want to kiss me. You want to hug me. You want to love me.'' 
This might summarize Ms. Bullock's curious relationship with her audience. We do want to love her, but she doesn't always make it easy. Her appeal is paradoxical: the more aggressively she flaunts her awkward, abrasive qualities, the more winning she is. And, conversely, whenever she sheds her ugly-duckling feathers, she sloughs off much of her charm. 
''Miss Congeniality,'' to mix zoological metaphors, is a standard-issue fish-out-of-water comedy, with Ms. Bullock as the fish. Gracie, slovenly, career-obsessed and barely socialized, has been placed on desk duty after botching an undercover assignment involving Russian mobsters, who have become Hollywood's acceptable ethnic bad guys of the moment. Before long, an enigmatic terrorist known as the Citizen announces by cryptic fax that he plans to disrupt the Miss United States pageant. A computerized paper-doll simulation shows Gracie to be the only agent in the bureau who looks good enough in a bathing suit to pass as one of the contestants. 
The problem of course is that in spite of her name, she's spectacularly graceless, utterly lacking in the poised femininity that the pageant celebrates. Luckily, Michael Caine is on hand in the role of Victor Melling, a disgraced beauty consultant who is hired as a taxpayer-financed Pygmalion. 
Mr. Caine, who performed a similar service for Julie Walters in the melodrama ''Educating Rita'' some years ago, gives one of his brisk, understated character performances. He infuses the part with a hint of pathos -- here is an aging man who has devoted his life to the cause of female beauty -- and adds a saving touch of lechery (directed not at Gracie, whom he finds unbearably vulgar, but at the handsome Agent Matthews). In the film's funniest sequence, Melling oversees a heroic government-supervised makeover, performed in an empty airplane hangar by a crack team of hairdressers, make-up daubers and experts in the art of depilation. 
A few other supporting performances add comic spark to a movie that otherwise seems happily, deliberately second-rate, as if its ideal audience consisted of weary airline passengers. (It's the kind of movie that would seem like a pleasant surprise in a cramped coach at 35,000 feet.) 
Candice Bergen is on hand as the pageant's organizer, a woman so brittle and tightly wound that a vigorous sneeze might snap off her nose. Her life, she tells Gracie, has become a crusade against ''feminists, intellectuals and ugly women'': epithets she seems to think apply especially well to undercover F.B.I. agents. William Shatner, relishing his newfound career as an icon of self-parody, has too few scenes as the contest's woozy host. 
The picture runs its course smoothly enough, with a few amusing scenes and a whodunit plot that's mildly suspenseful, provided you don't pay very close attention. But these days it seems no Hollywood comedy, however silly, can roll off the assembly line unless a heartfelt message about personal growth and self-discovery has been sprayed over it like rustproofing on a new car. By impersonating Miss New Jersey, Gracie discovers in herself the womanliness she had hitherto suppressed. 
In her final speech at the pageant, she pays earnest tribute to the valiant women she (and the movie) previously mocked as bimbos and airheads. And of course once the tomcatting Agent Matthews catches sight of her in her clingy gowns and tasteful swimwear, he wants to love her and kiss her and hug her. And why not? She embodies this year's movie ideal of womanhood: a martial arts expert who looks fabulous in tight clothes and keeps a .45 strapped to her thigh. 
The appeal of this fantasy, to men and women alike, is clear enough, though the version offered by ''Miss Congeniality'' pales beside the candy-colored mayhem of ''Charlie's Angels,'' the elegance of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' or the integrity of the unjustly neglected ''Girlfight.'' 
''Miss Congeniality'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some risque situations and mild profanity.

‽But Forever in My Mind‽,‽''But Forever in My Mind'' begins with a quotation from Abbie Hoffman and an audio tour of events from the Vietnam War to the fall of the Berlin Wall, with special emphasis, since the movie takes place in Rome, on Italy's rich history of political turmoil. 
The present-day 16-year-olds who populate Gabriele Muccino's new film, which opens today at the Film Forum, live in the shadow of bygone radicalism. When the students occupy their school, ostensibly to protest standardization and privatization -- words they pronounce with venomous conviction, even if it's not clear that they know what they're talking about -- they seem to be acting out a ritual of adolescence rather than taking a political stand. Indeed, the occupation is an annual event, like the senior prom, but with militant chanting, hand-lettered banners and an obligatory appearance by the police. 
Despite all the talk about struggling against reactionaries and the bourgeoisie, the social ecology of the Italian high school depicted in ''But Forever in My Mind'' will be familiar to viewers of after-school specials on American television. At one point Silvio (Silvio Muccino), a young man whose romantic and domestic troubles are the movie's main concern, provides a field guide to Roman teenagers, who divide themselves into fascists, alternatives, preppies and B-boys, distinctions based mostly on styles of dress. 
Silvio, whose parents are onetime student revolutionaries who have clearly made peace with bourgeois life, is desperate for love and sexual experience. In the heady chaos of the school takeover, he has a brief encounter with Valentina (Giulia Carmignani), provoking the jealousy of his friend Martino (Simone Pagani). After a series of comic misunderstandings and melodramatic confrontations with his bewildered parents, Silvio ends up with Claudia (Giulia Steigerwalt), who has been quietly carrying a torch for him for six months. 
Through most of these doings, ''But Forever in My Mind'' sustains a frenetic momentum. But even for a teenage romantic comedy and in spite of the political polemics, the stakes seem very low. The anguish of adolescence arises from trouble that is often objectively trivial but that feels like life and death when you're going through it. Mr. Muccino and his cast don't quite find the balance between poking fun at Silvio and his friends and honoring their feelings and ideals. Silvio himself comes across as too selfish and spoiled to deserve our sympathy or Claudia's devotion, and his friends, other than the jealous Martino, never emerge as distinct characters. Aiming for lighthearted, bittersweet charm, ''But Forever in My Mind'' slips into predictability and condescension. 
BUT FOREVER IN MY MIND 
Directed by Gabriele Muccino; written (in Italian, with English subtitles) by Mr. Muccino with the collaboration of Silvio Muccino and Adele Tulli and based on an idea of Marco Valerio Fusco; director of photography, Arnaldo Catinari; edited by Claudio Di Mauro; music by Paolo Buonvino; production designer, Eugenia F. di Napoli; produced by Domenico Procacci; released by Intra Films.

‽Dude, Where's My Car?‽,‽''Dude, Where's My Car?'' is a surprisingly sweet, mild-mannered movie for a teenage comedy spoof, and that's not a good thing. Yes, the film, which opened yesterday, has its gross-out moments (urination in a fish tank), its adolescent sexual obsessiveness (the same old breast fetish) and its druggy humor (a dog gets stoned on pot). But the mad excesses and gleeful tastelessness of a genre that calls to what remains of the dirty-minded brat in all of us are largely missing from this cheery post-''Wayne's World'' stew of teenage buddy jokes and low-rent sci-fi nonsense. 
It all begins the morning Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and his roommate Chester (Seann William Scott), a pair of pizza deliverers, wake up to find their refrigerator and cupboards crammed with a year's supply of pudding but can't remember how it got there or what they did the night before. The bad news accumulates. In addition to learning that they trashed the cottage of their twin girlfriends, Wanda (Jennifer Garner) and Wilma (Marla Sokoloff), they lost their car. 
Using clues (like matchbook covers), they retrace their steps to a strip club where Jesse is tempted by an irate transsexual stripper who demands the return of $200,000 Jesse has no recollection of having taken from her. They also find themselves  pursued by competing sects of extraterrestrials in search of a ''continuum transfunctioner'' that has the power to destroy the universe. 
Whom should they trust? The Nordic Dudes (a pair of Schwarzenegger clones)? A sect of space nerds outfitted in bubble wrap jumpsuits? Or the grimly sexy Hot Chicks, a troupe of sleek, buxom space babes who proffer erotic pleasure as a reward? The movie, directed by Danny Leiner from a screenplay by Philip Stark, is so flighty and disconnected that it barely bothers to answer that question. 
Although the movie has some promising comic setups (the best is a silly sequence in which our boys are surrounded and attacked by a group of ostriches), it is too lazy to bother following through. Even when it flirts with being offensive in a scene of blind children playing baseball, it has neither the wit nor the attention span to make anything of it. 
Mr. Kutcher and Mr. Scott exude an innocuous charm as sidekicks, but compared with Wayne and Garth or Cheech and Chong, or practically any other comedic teams you could name, they are strictly lightweight. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mildly off-color humor.

‽
‽What Women Want‽,‽''What Women Want'' starts with a great idea, but the movie's potential drops faster than the tech stocks on the Nasdaq. Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a cool-cat Chicago advertising executive with the Strip in his blood. His mother was a showgirl and raised him like a Vegas princeling. Now he prowls the streets of Chicago with a sexist joke at the ready, just like the cigarette that perches in the corner of his mouth. Nick is an unrepentant chauvinist: ''a man's man who doesn't get what women are all about,'' sighs his ex-wife, Gigi (Lauren Holly). His teenage daughter, Alex (well played by Ashley Johnson), thinks he's a jerk. 
Things change when Nick accidentally receives an electric shock in a bathroom blow drier accident and finds he can read women's minds. (''The kind of thing that happens all the time,'' Mr. Gibson joked in a recent appearance on David Letterman's show.) ''What Women Want'' is most amusing in the first 20 minutes, before Mr. Gibson has to find his inner sensitivity, and the picture becomes ''Tootsie'' for the slow-witted. 
Mr. Gibson plays Nick with a Rat Pack bounce, and without a leer. A man without complications, Nick revels in his shallowness and is genuinely happy bouncing from chick to chick. With his boys' toys, including a lustrous Breguet chronograph wristwatch and up-to-the-minute fashions (well, if the movie were set in 1992), he is what used to be called the Man Who Reads Playboy. 
Just before his accident gives him gender-specific telepathy, Nick loses a promotion because a woman, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), is brought in over him. His Cro Magnon masculinity no longer sells products, his boss (Alan Alda) tells him. It's up to Darcy to make changes and go after the female market that the agency has missed out on. ''I gotta think like a broad,'' Nick says, knitting his brow. 
As directed by Nancy Meyers, Nick isn't a character, really: he's a conceit, the kind of ring-a-ding 60's swingle that Tony Franciosa used to play after he decided to give up acting for a stretch and keep his grinning charm on high idle. The guy's- guy archetype that Nick represents was played by Nick Nolte in ''I Love Trouble,'' written by Ms. Meyers and her former partner, Charles Shyer. (''What Women Want'' is even set in Chicago, as was ''I Love Trouble.'') 
After Nick becomes a conduit for women's thoughts, he's doesn't exactly use his powers for the good of humanity -- not initially, anyway. In this shift, Ms. Meyers makes good use of music: Bobby Darin's ''Mack the Knife'' goes from setting the tone for Nick's stylishness to becoming an apt description of the way he plunders women's minds. The musical motifs put the picture across in a few scenes, as when Nick rifles through Alex's backpack looking for CD's to help put him in a more feminine frame of mind. (She seems a little young to be listening to Meredith Brooks and Alanis Morrisette, though.) 
Mr. Gibson shines for a good chunk of ''What Women Want.'' He's like Lee Marvin with a deeper range; he registers hurt when the thoughts of Nick's female co-workers pour into his hard head and he realizes what a dog they think he is. Mr. Gibson has often squeezed a bit of romantic comedy into even his sweatiest action roles, like his self-deprecating courtship scenes in ''Lethal Weapon 2,'' of all things. 
He hasn't had many chances to play full-blown romance since ''The Year of Living Dangerously,'' and he obviously digs not having to slam a clip into a handgun. You can hear the comfort level in his baritone; he's a man who knows how to use his voice to get what he wants, and like all brats, he assumes everyone else wants what he wants. 
''What Women Want'' is an update of the Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedies except, unlike those Ross Hunter productions, no one here has bothered to write a leading female character strong enough to pit against the male lead. It's not enough that Mr. Gibson is playing against type. Ms. Hunt gets all she can out of her chin-up querulousness, but like all the women in ''What Women Want,'' she's nice despite her reputation as a tough dart. 
It's this lack of definition that seems truly negligent; it seems that what women want is to show that they're all sweethearts. If the movie had the courage to show that women are complex people, it would be a much more inspired picture. Instead, it feels anachronistic and lifted from other movies, dawdling as it arrives at the inevitable conclusion that listening to women makes Nick a better man. 
Before it settles for sentimentality, the film occasionally clicks. As Lola, a damaged-goods actress working in a coffee shop, Marisa Tomei does some of her best work in years. Her date with Nick, who can't quite deal with the conflicting thoughts he is reading, is marvelously funny. The neuroses bounce across the screen, and Ms. Tomei is incredibly sexy when she's bored by his cockiness. 
The rest of ''What Women Want'' feels out of touch. Nick's steak-and-Scotch persona is now back in vogue in the ad world, which makes the listen-to-your-inner-voice Nike commercial Nick and Darcy put together seem like an artifact from the Jurassic Park Gift Shop. 
''What Women Want'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). it has strong language, sexuality and alcohol and drug use.

‽
‽The Emperor's New Groove‽,‽''The Emperor's New Groove'' is a timely reminder that animated films don't have to be grandiose visual circuses with full Broadway scores to entertain. 
Not even the parting of the Red Sea can substitute for a sprightly sense of humor and sharply etched cartoon characters swapping wisecracks and doing pratfalls. 
On the surface, Disney's newest animated film looks and sounds like a poor second cousin to Dreamworks's far more splendiferous (but dreary) ''Road to El Dorado.'' But once it hits its groove, so to speak, the new movie exhibits a cheeky effervescence and spunk that were conspicuously absent in its glittering dud of a predecessor. 
The obvious resemblances between the two begin with their pseudo-ancient settings. Where ''The Road to El Dorado'' evoked a gilded Disneyland version of the Mayan empire, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' paints a much less glamorous Saturday morning cartoon version of the Incas in Peru. Their monarch, Kuzco (David Spade), is a glib, sarcastic, monstrously selfish teenager who thinks nothing of having his subjects thrown out the window should they accidentally interfere with his upbeat ''groove.'' Both movies also involve a struggle for the crown and feature characters trading comic banter as they trek through the jungle. 
As the story begins, Kuzco is a happy little despot who is so self-involved that he fails to notice that his chief adviser, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), an ancient, embittered diva, hates his guts and is scheming for his downfall. Aided by her personal assistant, Kronk (Patrick Warburton), a stupid, muscle-bound oaf, Yzma tries to poison Kuzco, but the deadly potion succeeds only in turning him into a llama, which Kronk throws out of the castle. 
Lost in the jungle, Kuzco teams up with Pacha (John Goodman), a kindly peasant who helps him even though Kuzco once threatened to turn Pacha's mountain village into a private resort and send all the residents packing. The movie turns into a standard fable of initiation and growing up in which Kuzco learns enough about friendship and trust in his llama incarnation to acquire some humanity before his restoration to his old self and imperial rank. 
''The Emperor's New Groove,'' directed by Mark Dindal, shrewdly avoids pompous moralizing in favor of zany high jinks and snide, adolescent jokes, which Mr. Spade delivers with a typically smug twerpiness that suits the role just fine. David Reynolds's screenplay is particularly nasty toward old folks. Yzma is the butt of endless jokes about what a frightful old hag she is. 
When she learns that Kuzco is still alive, she and Kronk go looking for him with murder in their hearts. 
While visiting Pacha's family and claiming to be the emperor's great-aunt, Yzma is secretly mocked by  Pacha's children, who snicker that she looks too old to be merely a great-aunt. She must be a ''great-great-great-great-great-aunt,'' they insist. 
The movie has an abundance of clever acrobatic sight gags and giddy nonsense. During a farcical chase in a roadside restaurant, Kronk turns into a chef dishing out his speciality, spinach puffs, as doors slam open and shut. The final struggle for the magic potion that can transform Kuzco from a llama back into a human is an acrobatic free-for-all in which Kuzco and Yzma (who drinks from the wrong bottle and turns into a cat) compete to pounce on the elusive vial. 
Even the movie's lessons in cooperation have a springy touch. Twice, the squabbling Pacha and Kuzco are forced to save themselves from plunging into an abyss by shimmying back-to-back up opposing rock faces. 
If ''The Emperor's New Groove'' ultimately doesn't amount to much, its brand of mindless fun is easier to like than the morally freighted humor of many more expensive animated films that take their allegorical pretensions far too seriously.

‽Strippers‽,‽Directed by Jorge Ameer 
Not rated; 75 minutes 
Jorge Ameer's ''Strippers'' belongs to that vast cinematic underbelly of semiprofessional made-for-video movies that for reasons known only to God are lucky enough to enjoy a thoroughly undeserved theatrical release. Soft-core cinephiles be warned: the title is a misleading come-on. ''Strippers'' isn't about stripteasers but about  evil sharks, from rapaciously materialistic girlfriends and duplicitous business managers to unsympathetic financial institutions, that take pleasure in ''stripping'' an innocent guy of his wealth. 
The cheesy, amateurish film follows the precipitous downfall of Alan Gardner (Tony Tucci), an advertising executive who, in the space of a few days, loses his job, his girlfriend, his apartment and his income, is brutally beaten and ultimately dies of his injuries. The bizarre performances belong strictly to the ''read the cue cards and emote like crazy'' school of acting. 
The filmmaker himself appears as Kevin, the best friend of this unfortunate yuppie Job. Kevin is an entrepreneurial weirdo who comes up with the notion of a line of products whose colors are identified in commercials by the slang words for bodily fluids and excretions. Trust me: it's not funny.   STEPHEN HOLDEN 
‽
‽Proof of Life‽,‽Taylor Hackford's cold, savvy political thriller, ''Proof of Life,'' proves at least one thing. If Hollywood were to remake ''Casablanca'' (and let's fervently hope it has no such plans), Russell Crowe should be on the short list of candidates to play Rick. Although the new movie borrows elements (including a dramatic airport finale) from that World War II classic, it is more like a distant (and hollow) echo than a contemporary remake of the original. 
Set in present-day South America in the fictional country of Tecala (Latin America's second-ranking producer of cocaine after Colombia, we are told), ''Proof of Life'' cannily appropriates aspects of ''Casablanca'' for dramatic ballast. But the allusions ultimately backfire, because they only underscore a gaping lack of emotional connection among the characters in a romantic triangle that feels conspicuously unromantic. 
What ultimately sinks this stylish but heartless film is a flat lead performance by the eternally snippy Meg Ryan. Playing a corporate wife attracted to the hostage negotiator (Mr. Crowe) who is bargaining for her husband's life after he is kidnapped and held for ransom, Ms. Ryan expresses no inner conflict, nor much of anything else beyond a mounting tension. Even when her wide blue eyes well up with tears, the pain she conveys is more the frustration of a little girl who has misplaced her doll than any deep, empathetic suffering. 
Everything that's wrong with Ms. Ryan's performance is distilled in her trademark gesture of fingering her lower lip and going into an alluring pout. It may look cute, but it's dramatically false. 
When we first meet Ms. Ryan's character, Alice Bowman, she and her husband, Peter (David Morse), an American engineer supervising the building of a dam in Tecala, are bickering. The couple have traipsed all over the world, from Thailand to Africa (where Alice had a miscarriage) to South America, where they live in what was once a drug lord's splendid hacienda, bought at a fire sale price. Although Peter calls Alice a hippie, she is obviously fed up with all their traveling and ready to return to the United States to build a bland bourgeois nest. 
In the movie's early scenes, the queasy feeling that these two don't even like each other is so palpable it leaves a residue of sourness that extends through the rest of the film. Although Alice becomes extremely distressed after a rebel group kidnaps Peter and holds him hostage in a mountain retreat, her anguish doesn't really track after the nastiness we witnessed at the beginning. 
Enter Terry Thorne (Mr. Crowe), an Australian-born, London-based professional negotiator hired by corporations to bargain with kidnappers in high-profile cases. Terry, who has just wrapped up a ticklish assignment in Chechnya, flies to Tecala, where he shocks Alice with his hard-nosed advice about the dos and don'ts of bargaining. It's all about money and only about money, he explains. Bringing the ransom price down is a nerve-racking waiting game that can be won only by exercising the cool deliberation of a high-stakes poker player. 
Just as Terry is about to begin negotiating, he learns that the corporate insurance covering Peter's ransom has lapsed, and he abruptly returns to London. Once there, however, he realizes that Peter doesn't stand a chance without his help, and he returns just in time to snatch the negotiations from the hands of an unscrupulous, gun-toting local ''coordinator.'' 
This change of heart, or crisis of conscience, or whatever it is, is never satisfactorily explained. Might Terry have fallen for Alice when they first met? There are no indications to suggest he did. Having taken over the case, he scoffs at the kidnappers' initial demand of $3 million and insists on holding out for a paltry $600,000. 
But when another prisoner, a French Foreign Legion member, escapes from the rebels' hideaway with a map revealing Peter's whereabouts, Terry teams up with a fellow negotiator, Dino (David Caruso), and some mercenaries for a rescue operation, which they carry out with the exuberance of rampaging cowboys. 
''Proof of Life,'' which was inspired by William Prochnau's Vanity Fair article ''Adventures in the Ransom Trade'' and the book ''Long March to Freedom'' by Thomas Hargrove, is much better dealing with the business of kidnapping than with the attendant emotions. 
In its cynical (and convincing) worldview, money rules everything. The film is as contemptuous of the rapacious and deceitful Texan oil executives who have put Peter's company out of business as it is of the rebel kidnappers, a band of Marxist revolutionaries so thoroughly corrupted by their drug and kidnapping operations that they now spend much of their time getting high. The movie's scornful appraisal of American diplomats in Tecala sees them as slavishly beholden to the oil companies (which plan to run a pipeline into the area) and too powerless to offer Alice anything except official ''sympathy.'' 
Terry is the one beacon of integrity in this slithering mass of corruption and self-interest. And as he did in ''Gladiator,'' Mr. Crowe radiates a stubborn, heroic solidity. If his performance is a bit too self-contained (Terry's feeling for Alice is expressed only once, in a spontaneous, but carefully tender kiss), his effortless charisma is still sufficient to give the film a center of gravity. 
Were Mr. Crowe ever to play Rick in ''Casablanca,'' instead of Humphrey Bogart's hard-boiled wounded romantic, he would probably give him the mournful shambling aura of a loyal St. Bernard with a distant glimmer of fire in his eyes. Although that movie should never be made, one thing is certain: Mr. Crowe's performance would be something to watch. 
''Proof of Life'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of profanity and scenes of violence.

‽Vertical Limit‽,‽The director Martin Campbell knows what his competition is for ''Vertical Limit,'' a shallow yet empty action extravaganza set on the notorious Himalayan peak K2. It's the ''Cliffhanger'' trailer, which neatly jettisoned the (heh, heh) plot and shoehorned in every heart-stopping leap and explosion that took place in the blissful, snowcapped setting, where even sub-arctic temperatures couldn't keep Sylvester Stallone from wearing T-shirts. (The trailer is the best picture Renny Harlin ever made.) 
This time, it's Chris O'Donnell against the mountain. He plays Peter Garrett, a former mountaineer scaling K2 to save his sister, Annie (Robin Tunney), who is trapped with her fellow climbers in an icy crevasse that looks as if it were made of Tide. The height and the temperature are sure to kill them -- that is, if merciless winds and Annie's employer, the survive-at-all-costs entrepreneur Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton), don't do them in first. 
''Vertical Limit'' starts with a sequence that sets up the schisms between Peter and Annie, as well as Peter's reluctance to climb again. In this section, a pleasure climb that morphs into a nightmare version of a Mountain Dew commercial, Mr. Campbell shows the same breezy brio that he displayed in the opening of ''Goldeneye.'' Both demonstrated his talent for exposing human quirks in the middle of two-fisted choreography. This initial tease of a scene shows more class and thought than the rest of the movie, which lumbers from lardy exposition to climax overload. 
After the opening, ''Vertical Limit'' leaps three years ahead. Peter is now a photographer shooting in the Himalayas. Annie is there with the excessive and crudely manipulative Vaughn, who wants to use their expedition to publicize a new business venture. Vaughn has tried the climb before; someone notes, ''As you know, that attempt ended in tragedy.'' (Apparently, the oxygen is so thin at that height that even the ability to come up with competent dialogue is threatened.) The Vaughn base camp looks like a parking lot party at a Phish concert. 
When Annie and her group are lost, Peter volunteers to help, despite his issues. He is joined by Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), who is much tougher than his name would suggest. An ornery cuss, Wick is weathered enough to look as if he has spent the last 20 years sleeping on a mountain face, and when he gets ready to join Peter on the trip, he shaves his long beard with a blade and no water.  The aging Mr. Glenn looks like David Carradine, and his lines make him sound like a deranged version of Mr. Carradine's Caine from ''Kung Fu.'' 
''Vertical Limit'' is like an enabler for Mr. Campbell's action addiction.  The picture includes so many explosions on the mountain that you may leave the theater wondering why any of the Himalayas are still standing; the director begins to seem as cold and manipulative as Vaughn. The film gives lip service to Pakistani politics -- a brief mix of the book ''Into Thin Air'' and the old movie ''The King of the Khyber Rifles'' -- but only so that nitroglycerin can be introduced into the story. And it piles on characters like snowflakes in a blizzard, though they exist solely to be dispatched in some of the garishly cinematic demises that Mr. Campbell and company have in store. 
After a particularly pointless conversation about mortality, someone says: ''All men die. It's what they do before then that counts.'' Such a sentiment doesn't begin to explain ''Vertical Limit.'' 
''Vertical Limit'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence, explosions, avalanches and intense and harrowing scenes of mountain climbing.

‽Moon Shadow‽,‽In Alberto Simone's ''Moon Shadow,'' Tcheky Karyo plays an uptight physicist named Lorenzo who returns after a 20-year absence to the small Sicilian town where he grew up. With his fastidious clothes and his hurried abrasiveness, he is easily recognized as an outsider. ''Are you from the North?'' asks Salvatore, the twinkly-eyed local elder who has come to fix the roof of Lorenzo's dilapidated ancestral home, intending a sly put-down in the guise of an innocent query. 
That Lorenzo will loosen up and come to terms with the repressed emotions beneath his rational, impatient demeanor seems inevitable. The agents of his transformation are Salvatore, played with mischievous warmth by Nino Manfredi, and the residents of a local therapeutic community for the mentally ill, run by a harried cardigan-wearing mensch of a doctor named Titto (Johan Leyson). 
''Crazy people scare me,'' Lorenzo confesses, but soon he is spending enough time in their midst to discover their essential humanity, and, of course, his own. 
''Moon Shadow'' (''Colpo di Luna''), which was shown at a number of European festivals in 1995 and opens today at Cinema Village, explores its delicate subject with restrained sentimentality. As Mr. Simone portrays them, Titto's charges are indeed sometimes scary, and sometimes comical in their tics and delusions. 
Movies about mental illness risk either romanticizing the subject or rendering it monstrous, and this film opts, though not egregiously, for romance. When the patients are shown frolicking at the seashore, or wandering into the courtyard of their residence in the midst of a rainstorm, one cannot escape the inference that they're meant to seem somehow more noble, and closer to nature, than their sane counterparts. 
Though this is a questionable notion, Mr. Simone doesn't push it too far, and he suggests, through Titto's mouth, that the alternative, a starkly medical approach to mental illness, is worse. And if Lorenzo's transformation seems a little forced, it's conveyed with a minimum of melodrama. 
The key to the movie is Salvatore, whose decency stops thankfully short of saintliness. His slowly developing friendship with Lorenzo, and his relationship with a particularly troubled young patient, are explored with understated tenderness, and Mr. Manfredi is a joy to watch. 
''Moon Shadow'' is a modest and thoughtful movie, and if it doesn't quite break new ground in addressing its difficult subject, it at least does not cheapen it.

‽Quills‽,‽One of the funniest and most riveting scenes in ''Quills'' sets the tone for the movie, though it doesn't come early. In the Charenton Asylum, Abbe Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) and Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) are discussing the best way to handle the infuriating Marquis de Sade, and as they walk, these men of reason are surrounded by demonstrations of the most modern medical treatments: bloodletting, phrenology and the like. It's the kind of casual absurdity that the film's director, Philip Kaufman, delights in, and ''Quills'' at its best lets him display a graceful wiliness. This story of the Marquis de Sade, adapted by Doug Wright from his play of the same title, isn't exactly a docudrama. It invents elements to make its rather obvious point about the price exacted by art and the state that liberals trying to do what's right can be whipped into. Fortunately, the elegance of Mr. Kaufman's direction and his handling of the cast make for the kind of euphoric stylishness that has been missing from moviegoing for some time. 
Much of that elan comes from Geoffrey Rush, who plays Sade as a gleeful voluptuary unfettered by either morality or what for him would be the most venal of sins, sentimentality. Sade is a flamboyant pansexual, a glittering vulture who exploits others for his own delectation. A man who views rot as the ultimate form of self-expression, he's quite vain about moral deterioration, and he keeps himself a bewigged and perfumed dandy. For him, his stay in the Charenton Asylum is merely slumming, a time when he gets to evaluate the damaged and discarded psyches that litter the rooms and decide which is his most apt target. And Mr. Kaufman revels in the chaos. 
Sade creates trouble because even while confined at Charenton, he manages to have his scandalous writing published. His scribblings, laundry lists of depravity, are smuggled out of the asylum by Madeleine (Kate Winslet), a virginal laundress eager to conspire with him. But Sade's writings are becoming a threat to the crumbling French establishment. The compassionate Coulmier thinks that Sade is a possible candidate for redemption, but is unable to keep him under wraps. Mr. Phoenix's thoughtful performance makes it clear that Coulmier clings to decency because it offers him self-definition and sanity; without it, he'd be lost, potentially worse off than any of the asylum's inmates. 
Coulmier's essential goodness marks him as a failure, and Napoleon dispatches the more businesslike Royer-Collard to silence Sade. (Mr. Caine's performance is tart and precise, a portrait of a man who isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is.) 
As conceived by Mr. Wright and Mr. Rush, Sade is a man so utterly convinced of his own allure that his confidence functions as a form of madness; what's really the difference between Sade and the inmate who thinks he's a bird? And as portrayed by Mr. Rush, Sade's spoiled conviviality is a disease; this awe-inspiring sociopath infects others with the need to do his bidding, and they go along happily. This could have made the other performers into no more than quirky straight men for Sade's arch blustering, but Mr. Kaufman solves this by focusing on Mr. Rush's face as he listens closely during dialogue. Like any good predator, he's waiting for the moment to pounce. 
Accentuating Sade's attention to others is Mr. Kaufman's way of putting the rest of the cast on an equal footing. Ms. Winslet rises to the challenge. She comes across as a member of the lower class whose native intelligence makes her worthy of Sade's notice. She knows it, too, and deploys her own wiles to keep him at bay. Ms. Winslet's shrewdness as an actress has never been better displayed than it is here, as she shows that she's aware of how intoxicating Sade's presence can be and is intrigued enough to go along for the ride. 
''Quills'' occasionally becomes pretentious and shrill -- sometimes Mr. Wright isn't aware that his material is so good that he doesn't need to comment on his characters, and the effect at the end of hoisting Sade on his own petard is totally unnecessary. But Mr. Kaufman moves the film briskly along. Like Sade, he loves stirring up trouble. 
''Quills''' is rated R. It contains nudity, violence, torture, sexuality and adult language.

‽Unbreakable‽,‽''Unbreakable,'' a follow-up to ''The Sixth Sense'' by the writer and director M. Night Shyamalan, is probably the most anticipated film of the season. As such, it is bound to disappoint because there is no way to repeat such a box office sensation. 
What ''Unbreakable'' shows is Mr. Shyamalan's remarkable growth as a director. Some of the sequences are particularly fine, crisp and contained, and given his thirst for commercial success, bewitchingly spare with long, fluid takes. 
Instead of following a huge hit with a wildly overcomplicated movie as long as a night of prime-time television, Mr. Shyamalan goes the other way. ''Unbreakable'' is tidy and compact, and seems to have been only grazed by plot. This is a superhero comic rendered as a haiku. It is Superman starring in ''The Seventh Seal'' with  an inspired twist: helping others only increases the hero's sadness. Mr. Shyamalan may be the only mainstream director hankering for success with a need to understate; he is like Shaq without the tattoos. The result is a mastery of craft that may leave some hungry for more. 
His ominous minimalism starts with his use of Bruce Willis. This actor is deprived of his bag of tricks -- his winner's swagger and a smirk that has inspired more on-screen action than any soft-core film star. Instead, the movie imbues his character, a security guard named David Dunn, with a tragic mournfulness from the outset. 
In the first scene, the unfailingly polite Dunn begins a conversation with a woman sitting next to him on a train, and the camera glides between the two of them, framing each person between the train's seats for a widescreen emphasis of their anxiety. Dunn's intensity scares the woman off and she scurries for another seat. That same train later crashes, leaving him unmarked and the sole survivor. (As a doctor delivers this news to Dunn, the sheets covering a corpse in front of them slowly brightens with blood.) 
Mr. Shyamalan's biggest interest is in investing his protagonists with a bone-deep empathy, which feels like an answer to the glib 80's heroes that Mr. Willis has played. Mr. Willis has the charisma to hold the audience with his pain. 
His life is contrasted with that of Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from a condition that makes him as fragile as a matzo. His mother (Charlayne Woodard, whose warm dimples suggest boundless care) lures the teenage Elijah (Johnny Hiram Jamison) out of the house and into the world with comic books. He grows up to become a successful and imperious dealer in comic book art, wearing ensembles resembling things that the designer Claude Montana might put together for ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and driving around Philadelphia in a Checker Marathon. (In this movie, a gallery show of comic book art attracts the kind of crowd more likely to turn up at a Vanity Fair Hollywood book party, a charming conceit.) 
Mr. Jackson's baleful charisma is deepened because Elijah, too, suffers. He does wonders with the role, giving haunted credibility to a part that comes with a hairpiece that makes him look like one of the Delfonics at the peak of their mighty, mighty Afroed glory. 
''Unbreakable'' is Mr. Shyamalan's tribute to comic books and superheroes, but he uses the comic book only as a starting point; he wants to investigate the properties of heroism. He offers tantalizing suggestions, but leaves a lot for the audience to fill in because he refuses to give in to the conventions of the genres; at no point, for example, does Dunn get to pump his arms and bellow, ''Yes!'' 
The comic book allusions come one right after another, although Mr. Shyamalan doesn't linger over them. Elijah, who learns of Dunn's mysterious survival, feels he has to force him into action: ''These are mediocre times,'' Elijah tells Dunn. ''People are starting to lose hope.'' 
Elijah explains Dunn's powers to him: invulnerability and a telepathic ability to feel people's criminal impulses. But Dunn has an Achilles' heel that comes into play during the  most intense scene, in which the hero tries to use his powers to aid someone in need. (In his hooded green poncho, Dunn resembles the the Spectre, a comics hero.) 
Audiences will bring high hopes to ''Unbreakable'' because of ''The Sixth Sense.'' Both ''Wide Awake'' (which had the grinding overdeliberateness of a particularly malevolent ''Afterschool Special'') and ''The Sixth Sense'' focused on children whose special sensitivity isolated them. Dunn could be the adult version of the boy from ''The Sixth Sense.'' The morbid ramifications of his gift emerge as ''Unbreakable'' goes on. 
Mr. Shyamalan shows that ''The Sixth Sense'' was no accident; deadpan melancholy has quickly become his signature. By giving Mr. Willis less to do, he gives him more time to concentrate on craft. Mr. Shyamalan also lets Mr. Jackson employ a dignified curiosity that he has never had a chance to use. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Shyamalan didn't seem to get around to writing parts for the rest of the cast. Robin Wright Penn, for example, is wasted as Dunn's wife. But you have to admire Mr. Shyamalan's willingness to lay back. He proves to be a major talent who has to wrestle with a nemesis of his own: his past success. 
''Unbreakable'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes adult language and scenes of psychological intensity and violence.

‽
‽102 Dalmatians‽,‽Disney is not a company known for leaving well enough alone. In its zeal to convert every successful movie into a franchise, the studio often crosses the line between giving audiences what they want and mindless overkill. 
The live-action remake of ''101 Dalmatians,'' released in 1996 to acquaint a new generation to an especially beloved tale, may have had the unintended effect of obscuring the original it meant to honor. But that movie, in part as a result of Glenn Close's delicious villainy in the role of Cruella DeVil, was at least an adequate piece of children's entertainment and a harmless bit of nostalgia for the grown-ups. 
The same cannot be said for the sequel, imaginatively titled ''102 Dalmations,'' in which Ms. Close, with a reprise of her earlier role, is reduced to shrieking hysteria and then subjected to grotesque humiliation. The plot is a perfunctory scramble of family-film conventions. Two anodyne, attractive young people, Kevin and Chloe (Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans) fall in love. Puppies are born -- perfectly housebroken, judging from the state of Chloe's cozy London apartment -- and frolic cutely for the cameras. 
In keeping with the supposed demand for juvenile pop culture that is hip, loud and crass as well as syrupy sweet, there is a beat-heavy theme song bitten off George Clinton's ''Atomic Dog,'' a second garish villain (Gerard Depardieu, sporting a yellow Billy Idol haircut and a leopard's-head codpiece), and a wisecracking macaw, who thinks he's a Rottweiler and who delivers his one-liners in the cockney squawk of the former Monty Pythonist Eric Idle. 
The setup seems calculated to baffle children, especially those whose memory of ''101 Dalmatians'' has dimmed. Cruella, it seems, has been cured by behaviorist therapy. To the surprise of Chloe, who happens to be her parole officer, Cruella, who now insists on being called Ella, has become a dog lover and an animal rights crusader. 
She magnanimously saves Kevin's animal shelter from bankruptcy, and redecorates it according to her own remarkable tastes. But the chimes of Big Ben suddenly reverse her therapy, and soon she enlists an evil furrier named Le Pelt (Mr. Depardieu) to help her fashion ''a hooded spotted puppy coat.'' The added feature of the hood requires an extra dog skin, and thus a whole new movie. 
As in the first one, most of the wit and originality in evidence are the work of the costume designer, Anthony Powell. Cruella's baroque couture reflects the vicissitudes of her temperament. In her nice phase, she's all feathers, flowers and appliqued birds' heads. Restored to her true nature, she decks herself out in repellent animal splendor. When she gets her just desserts -- quite literally, since at the end she's baked into a giant waddling layer cake -- what is meant as over-the-top slapstick turns ugly and mechanical. It's a tiresome retread of the ending of ''101 Dalmatians,'' which itself repackaged the excesses of the ''Home Alone'' movies. 
''102 Dalmatians'' will probably make some money, but many of the tickets are likely to be purchased more out of desperation than enthusiasm. Children are sure to respond to the animals, and adults may smile at a clever, if obvious, quotation from ''The Lady and the Tramp,'' but neither generation will find much to love. The most dispiriting news is that, so far, this movie is probably no worse than its principal competition. In a season like this, what's one dog more or less?

‽
‽Bounce‽,‽Don Roos's ultra-sleek romantic drama ''Bounce'' is a perfect illustration of the adage that God is in the details. Although its aspirations aren't much loftier than to meet the specifications of what might be called High Formula Hollywood moviemaking, this touching, finely  wrought bowl of suds is a seamless piece of work, comparable in its craft to ''Jerry Maguire'' and ''As Good as It Gets,'' if a bit slighter. 
The film's two stars, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck, emerge from the movie as the most soulful (if not the most torrid) romantic coupling to animate a Hollywood film in quite some time. As their characters tiptoe warily into each other's hearts, the  cross-currents of longing and anxiety rippling through their faces tell us exactly how much is at stake. 
For a change, it isn't simply a matter of will they or won't they end up in bed together but of whether these two complicated, strong-willed individuals can summon the courage to commit themselves to a serious  relationship. It has been ages since a  Hollywood screen couple, gazing into each other's eyes, conveyed this much emotion. 
As Abby Janello, the widowed mother of two young boys, Ms. Paltrow gives a performance of astounding delicacy and depth. Her tiniest, seemingly throwaway gestures and slightest changes of expression have the transparency of great screen acting on a miniature  scale. She is also utterly convincing as a harried, caring mother of two. 
Playing Buddy Amaral, a swaggering, gregarious advertising executive recovering from alcoholism, Mr. Affleck nearly matches Ms. Paltrow in the understated intensity and exquisite detail of his performance. More than once in the movie, his eyes tear up. But this actor, with his beseeching hound dog look and trembling lower lip, never becomes mawkish. His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined ''people person'' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive. 
''Bounce'' isn't anywhere near as nervy as ''The Opposite of Sex,'' the film that put Mr. Roos on the map as a fast-rising director and screenwriter. In its conventional, largely predictable story of commitment wariness among contemporary yuppies, you can feel the screenplay's gears churning and time the beats of its dialogue. Late in the movie, when Abby delivers the speech from which ''Bounce'' takes it title, it feels almost too neat. And a running joke about the meaning of the word ''dooryard'' (from Whitman) is repeated one too many times. 
But this carefully nurtured sense of snugness is also what High Formula movie-making is all about. What's remarkable about the screenplay and the calculated, somewhat  far-fetched plot is the dexterity with which Mr. Roos avoids small cliches to reinvigorate a larger one. 
In its texture, its eye for detail, and language, ''Bounce'' offers an extremely accurate portrait of the style and mood of the yuppie class in this country right now. For all the  emotions on display, it's a slightly chilly portrait. 
The opening scenes in an airport  perfectly capture the pent-up frantic experience of contemporary air travel. And the scenes in the advertising agency where Buddy is a high-flying partner in charge of the Infinity Airline account precisely calibrate the nerve-racking mixture of cynicism, bravado, creativity, defensiveness and public relations savvy in his cutthroat world. Later scenes of fast-talking real estate negotiations display a similar hard-edged knowingness. 
What spins the story into motion is Buddy's last-minute decision to give his plane ticket (on an Infinity flight) to a young Los Angeles writer he meets casually while held up by a snowstorm at O'Hare. The stranger, Greg Janello (Tony Goldwyn) is eager to return to his family in Los Angeles, while Buddy in giving up his ticket frees himself for an overnight fling with a pretty Dallas businesswoman. 
But when the plane crashes in Kansas, killing more than 200, including Greg, Buddy is guilt-stricken, and his drinking soon crosses the line into alcoholism. After embarrassing himself at an awards ceremony for his contributions to a saccharine Infinity Airlines ad, he checks into a rehab. 
The story skips ahead a year. Buddy has dried out but is still shaky inside. As part of his 12-step atonement, he pays a visit to Greg's widow, Abby, not telling her of his connection to her dead husband. She's now a novice real estate agent, and he connives to help her make a deal for the purchase of his own company's new quarters. Attracted to Buddy, Abby, who says she is divorced, hesitantly initiates a dating relationship. As it turns more serious, the inevitable, increasingly scary question looms of how and when Buddy will tell her the truth. 
Directing his own screenplay, Mr. Roos displays the same brilliant restraint that Kenneth Lonergan shows in ''You Can Count on Me,'' another ultra-realistic film that shares this movie's aversion to gratuitous melodrama. When Abby is informed of Greg's death, for instance, the camera pulls away to observe her reactions from afar, and its lack of proximity makes the far-off vision of her sudden flailing grief all the more wrenching. The movie completely omits the drama of Buddy's rehabilitation. Instead of zeroing in on its characters' heated confrontations, in most cases it prefers to show their aftermath. 
Enriching the film are some expertly fleshed-out minor characters, notably Buddy's hardnosed boss (Joe Morton) and his cheeky gay assistant (Johnny Galecki), a 12-step graduate who minces no words. If David Dorfman and Alex D. Linz as Abby's young sons are a little too Hollywood-cute for comfort, at least they're not gratingly so. 
''Bounce'' may be far from a great film, but its pleasures are consistent enough to remind you of how few movies nowadays come anywhere close to matching it in intelligence and emotional balance. It is not only a terrific date movie, but also one that doesn't make you feel ashamed afterward for getting misty-eyed. 
''Bounce'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

‽
‽Suspended Animation‽,‽A psychological horror film from the Midwest-based independent director John D. Hancock, ''Suspended Animation'' is a sturdy, well-made piece that never quite overcomes its structural flaws. 
Tom Kempton (Alex McArthur) is a celebrated animator who winters in northern Michigan, where a snowmobile accident leads him into the clutches of two weird sisters, Vanessa and Ann Boulette. Vanessa (Laura Esterman) is a willowy former dancer and Ann (Sage Allen) an overweight homebody, and they have been operating their own girl-power version of the notorious Wisconsin farmhouse of the 1950's serial killer Ed Gein, butchering passers-by and creating knick-knacks and gourmet meals from their body parts. 
Duct-taped to a wheelchair and tortured, Tom manages to escape when his snowmobile buddies fortuitously show up with some shotguns. The ensuing melee leaves the sisters presumed dead, but for Tom the nightmare is not over. Obsessed with Vanessa, he tracks down the illegitimate daughter (Maria Cina) she gave up 30 years earlier and finds her living in Hollywood, a bartender and would-be actress, under the name Clara Hansen. Tom hires her to pose for a character in his new animated feature, an allegorical account of his ordeal at the hands of her mother and aunt. 
After a slam-bang opening ''Suspended Animation,'' which opens today in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, goes into something of a coma itself with the tedious exposition necessary to get the plot convolutions across. It slowly develops that Clara, who is unaware of her heritage, has a sinister 15-year-old son (Fred Meyers), who may have inherited his grandmother's homicidal tendencies. At least that is Tom's suspicion when he comes across a mass of human tissue wrapped in aluminum foil and hidden in the boy's toolbox. 
The situation is creepy, but the screenplay by Dorothy Tristan, Mr. Hancock's wife and frequent collaborator, has trouble transforming it into genuine suspense. The menace remains vague and unfocused until one major character makes a not entirely unexpected reappearance in the last act, by which point much of the tension has been lost. 
Mr. Hancock, however, remains a fine director of actors, and Ms. Esterman, a gifted stage actress making a rare film appearance, delivers an eerily ambiguous performance, part lovable eccentric and part Hannibal Lecter. Though the film was shot on high-definition video, Mr. Hancock's framing has the steadiness and precision of classic 35-millimeter filmmaking, and his editing, far from the pointless MTV pyrotechnics in the current remake of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' is all but invisible and much more effective for it.

‽
‽Ali‽,‽''Ali'' is a breakthrough for its director, Michael Mann. The film, based on the life of Muhammad Ali, is Mr. Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds. 
That subject is a man whose mesmerizing surfeit of athleticism, beauty and moral and physical courage -- and enchanting lack of humility -- had no modern equivalent. As it follows, for roughly the first hour, Ali from the first Sonny Liston fight in 1964 through the duel with George Foreman in Zaire in 1974, the picture has a quick-moving breathlessness. Instead of soaking the movie in deadpan, minor-key electronica -- even Mr. Mann's directorial debut, ''Thief,'' employed the blue-steel proto-techno of Tangerine Dream -- ''Ali'' is fired up from the outset with a burst of, well, heat. 
We hear the strains of Sam Cooke getting a groove on to ''Bring It on Home to Me.'' But it isn't the velveteen rabbit Sam Cooke from the recordings of the time, muscular but always in control. It's the Sam Cooke heard on the posthumous recording ''Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963.'' There he unleashed himself from buttery smoothness. Playing to a black audience, he teased the crowd into a frenzy. It's an understanding of soul that one would never have expected from this director, who uses the music as entrance, to build tension, since Ali -- one of the most famous tongues of all times -- is nearly silent for the first 10 minutes or so. 
This is a brilliantly considered bit of stage setting; intercut with the song is Ali (Will Smith) jogging through bleak, wintry, nighttime streets, a squad car with a couple of white cops pulling over in front of him. ''What you runnin' from, son?'' one of them lazily asks, the casual racism colder than the night. 
Ali was the first black popular figure to break down the wall between performance for a black audience and for a white audience, which is what Cooke was straining to do, and the first 10 minutes of ''Ali'' seethe with ambition. Mr. Mann wants to get past the headlines about the most incendiary figure ever to enter the ring, a man whose wit -- both physical and verbal -- was so exciting that the world hung on his every word. 
For this reason ''Ali,'' in the abstract, seems like the wrong material for this filmmaker. For Mr. Mann, a man is defined by what he is does: in ''Heat,'' the thief (Robert De Niro) and the detective (Al Pacino), equally dogged, have no lives other than their occupations. And in Mr. Mann's world of existential working-class drama, a man stripped of his profession is nothing; that's what ''The Insider'' was all about. 
Muhammad Ali inside the ring and Muhammad Ali outside the ring were totally different men; his abrasive, magnetic daring and infectious self-love outside the ring galvanized the world and distracted many from his sniper's precision. He was a heavyweight with the fluttering gracefulness of a middleweight. He so flouted the established protocol of sports behavior that when the world sided with Liston, the scary black man, against Cassius Clay/Ali, the even scarier one, a black Muslim who represented the future, it signaled a paradigm shift. 
Ali was the African-American who exulted in saying exactly what he was capable of, and the bouncing-boy braggadocio of hip-hop is impossible to imagine without him. So it makes sense that one of his spiritual children, the sunny-dispositioned rapper turned actor Will Smith, would play him. And Mr. Smith's not short on self-regard either; running through the streets of Miami in Michael Bay's 1995 film ''Bad Boys,'' sweat glistening off the six-pack abs he proudly shows off in slow motion for the camera, he seemed ready to take on the part. For Mr. Smith, who thickened his frame to act Ali, it's a chance to, in the words of one of his songs, ''Boom! Shake the Room.'' 
The script has been developed to give Mr. Smith the opportunity to burrow inside Ali. There are moments of the rousing Ali, as he announces his refusal to go to Vietnam or spars with Howard Cosell, played by Jon Voight, whose portrayal is a riveting tribute to his character actor's instincts. Mr. Voight goes beyond impersonation; he makes Cosell a recognizable human being. 
Mr. Smith captures Ali's musicality, pausing in midsyllable while ranting and exhaling to punch things up and turn even a joke into something operatic. As written, Ali is reflecting on the world whizzing by him. Away from the media, Ali is solemn, almost melancholy, and his voice is lower, weighed down. This is where Ali becomes a Michael Mann figure: an ascetic dressed in dark clothes. 
Mr. Smith is surrounded by a cast that alternately rises and falls; only some of them are up to the challenge. One who is up to it is Jamie Foxx, as Drew (Bundini) Brown, Ali's manager and aide de camp and the phrase-making inventor of ''float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,'' who grasps the material hard and gives the performance of a lifetime. 
Mr. Foxx, who plumped up like a Ball Park frank, makes Brown a fascinating, open-faced display of vulnerability and machismo. There's a give and take in the relationship between Ali and Brown that can't be found in the rest of film. Ali's penchant for cruelty and his tendency to judge are all directed at Brown. The picture doesn't investigate the most amazing contradiction: during the most flamboyant moments of the black pride movement, the light-skinned Ali ridiculed his three main opponents, Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman, all of them dark-skinned men, as big, ugly bears and got away with it. 
Ali is depicted as a bystander sometimes, and Mr. Smith is stranded when he has to be contemplative. He springs to life, though, when he works with other actors; he is nuanced and engaged, and like Ali has an instinct for pleasure. And, like Ali, it comes through as he makes others twist in the wind; Mr. Smith's gift for counterpunching is as good as that of the man he's playing. 
The movie wants to be a warts-and-all look at the Greatest. Still, it skips through Ali's flaws -- his womanizing, for example -- more than shows them, except in the scenes with Ali and Brown together; there's a complicated friction here, with Ali being both admiring and resentful of Brown. Both actors get at something unnerving. Ali is a more rounded person in these instances: a bullet with butterfly wings. 
Ali's luster is further muddied in his interactions with Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles). After Malcolm is rebuked when his change of heart leads him to deviate from the teachings of the rigid Elijah Muhammad (Albert Hall), Ali abandons him. The movie doesn't shy away from this terrible moment, and Mr. Smith's stricken reaction almost makes up for Mr. Van Peebles's underwhelming turn. (Malcolm's assassination, using another Cooke song, ''A Change Is Gonna Come,'' is uncomfortably close to scenes in Spike Lee's ''Malcolm X.'') Flaws like the Malcolm X scenes come because Mr. Mann seems to have cast for physical resemblance to the real subjects. Mr. Van Peebles seems like a male model pondering a costume change. 
Ali's allegiance to Elijah Muhammad, despite protests from Sonji (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Belinda (Nona Gaye), his first and second wives, is prefigured in a line from the Cooke song that opens the film -- ''I will always be your slave, until I'm buried, buried in my grave'' -- though early on, that lyric serves as a counterpoint. 
''Ali'' offers stunning re-creations of bouts Ali fought. In the second Liston fight, the auditorium is underlighted and clouded with fetid cigar smoke, which was why the famous picture of a snarling Ali standing over Liston was so dramatic; indoor arenas are now bright enough to be spotted from Alpha Centauri. 
The men playing Liston (Michael Bentt), Foreman (Charles Shufford) and Frazier (James N. Toney) are professional boxers, and they all duplicate the original boxers' styles. During the ring sequences, ''Ali'' has more fealty to the matches than did the punch-outs of ''Raging Bull.'' The cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki, uses the wide screen to paint a number of vistas, with a freewheeling, hand-held vivacity that takes the director back to his documentary roots. The last section is devoted to the 1974 Ali-Foreman battle in Zaire, and it often -- sometimes too often -- evokes ''When We Were Kings,'' Leon Gast's glorious 1996 documentary on events surrounding that fight. (This movie sometimes plays like a more benevolent version of ''Ghosts of Manilla,'' Mark Kram's dissection of the Ali myth.) 
''Ali'' has to collapse several lifetimes worth of incidents into a manageable running time, which is too bad. Any of the fights and the incidents leading up to them could make a separate film; the movie is bent from ambition, but it doesn't crumple under the weight. 
The director's acuity is leavened by his passion, which is beguiling. It's reflected in some wondrous ways: many of the domestic settings, like Elijah Muhammad's home, with the living room furniture wrapped in plastic covers, begin as though captured for photographs, and then come to life as the characters start to speak. This is most evident in the superb scenes with Mr. Smith and Ms. Gaye in their loving but rapidly more troubled home. 
Mykelti Williamson surfaces in the Zaire section as Don King, a study in dynamic duplicity. The picture doesn't shy away Ali's impatience with King's perfidy, either. 
For ''Ali,'' the question becomes, how do you convey the excitement embodied by Muhammad Ali? The answer is that Mr. Mann wants his movie to do more than that. And more often than not, it does. We see the movie levitate when Ali and Brown chant, ''Float like a butterfly,'' the slogan that takes on a different meaning in each context, starting off as hopeful and spry, finally becoming rueful and pointed. When the film pulls off moments like these, it's breathtaking -- a near great movie. 
This movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence inside the ring and out, and strong language and sexual situations that make Ali seem more human than he may have been regarded before.

‽
‽Kate & Leopold‽,‽A long-running fantasy drilled into the minds of generations of American women by Hollywood movies and romance novels is that a refined, dapper Englishman with a cultivated accent and a title is the ultimate catch. That fantasy is made all the sweeter if the Englishman is a blast from the past. How about a courteous Victorian gentleman who stands when a lady rises from the table, refers to dating as courting and understands the language of flowers? (Orange lilies imply hatred, and begonias and lavender signal danger and suspicion.) 
But the cherry on this human sundae has to be his equestrian mastery. Once astride a horse, he becomes the embodiment of the proverbial knight on a white charger. Encountering such a creature, the only choice left for a stressed-out modern damsel is to shed her defenses, swoon in his arms and be carried off into a Victorian happily ever after. 
Enter the Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who gallops into Meg Ryan's life across a span of more than 100 years in the frothy romantic comedy ''Kate and Leopold.'' As Leopold, the dashing third duke of Albany and the world's most eligible bachelor in 1876, Mr. Jackman is as perfect a specimen of romance-novel dreaminess as Hollywood has concocted in quite a while. Leopold is no fool. He is credited with inventing the elevator. 
If ''Kate and Leopold'' were a 1940's movie, Ms. Ryan's character, Kate McKay, would probably be a wide-eyed shop girl (Loretta Young perhaps) weaned on Jane Austen and Emily Brontë who lands in the arms of Cary Grant or Laurence Olivier. Here she is a crisp, high-powered marketing maven whose company measures the public taste in everything from movies to margarine. 
Kate lives in a Manhattan apartment one flight down from her ex-boyfriend, Stuart Besser (Liev Shreiber), an eccentric scientist. Unbeknown to Kate, Stuart discovers a time-traveling portal that can be accessed by jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge at certain moments, and the movie's opening scene finds him newly arrived with a camera in late-19th-century Manhattan. 
Stuart winds up at a bash at which the Victorian duke, whose family fortunes are in dire need of replenishment, is about to announce his engagement to a wealthy but unattractive American heiress. When Leopold catches Stuart snooping around the house, Stuart flees, and Leopold chases him through the streets and up the side of the still unfinished Brooklyn Bridge from whose girders they tumble into the present through the same magic portal. As they arrive in 2001, all the elevators in Manhattan go haywire. 
''Kate and Leopold,'' directed by James Mangold from a screenplay he wrote with Steven Rogers, barely acknowledges reality, and that is its saving grace. It is essentially a Nora Ephron fairy tale with a sci-fi twist and a lot more plot than you might find in one of Ms. Ephron's cotton-candy daydreams. 
From the moment Kate and Leopold set eyes on each other, it's obvious that true love will soon blossom. And as it does, their romantic combat boils down to competing one-liner views of love and work with the cutesy twist that the woman is the cynic and the man the romantic. 
Kate snaps, ''You can't live a fairy tale,'' while Leopold floridly declares: ''Marriage is a promise of eternal love. As a man of honor I cannot promise eternally what I have never felt momentarily.'' Kate insists she doesn't have time for speeches from ''200-year-old men who have never had to work a day in their life.'' 
Once they're acquainted, Kate has the bright idea of featuring Leopold in a television commercial for a low-fat butter substitute. All goes swimmingly until Leopold samples the product he's hawking and stalks off the set, declaring it tastes like ''pond scum.'' 
''You have every convenience, every comfort, yet no time for integrity,'' he scolds. To which Kate replies, ''I've been paying dues all my life, and I'm tired, and I need a rest, and if I have to sell a little pond scum to get it, then so be it.'' 
Such exchanges may lack the tang of classic screwball comedy, but they have more flavor than most comic movie dialogue nowadays. Ms. Ryan's lines sound custom written to suit her snippy, plastic pertness, while Mr. Jackman lends Leopold's haughty pronouncements enough good humor to keep his character from turning into an insufferable twit. 
Leopold is an Emily Post-like repository of dating etiquette, which he is more than happy to pass on to others. His tips to Kate's crude, doltish brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer) help Charlie get to first base with his own dream girl. Dropping by a restaurant where Kate's manipulative boss J. J. Camden (Bradley Whitford) is trying to impress Kate with his bogus passion for opera, Leopold trumps him with his knowledge of ''La Bohème.'' (There's just one catch. ''La Bohème'' wasn't written until 1896, two decades after Leopold's leap into the present.) 
In the most dramatic scene Kate's purse is snatched as she is hailing a cab on Fifth Avenue, and Leopold promptly borrows a handy carriage horse and heroically charges into Central Park to apprehend the mugger. 
As I said, ''Kate and Leopold'' has only the most tangential relation to reality, and therein lies its slender charm. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

‽
‽Joe Somebody‽,‽The innocuous new Tim Allen comedy, ''Joe Somebody,'' could be described as a middle-aged corporate version of the 97-pound weakling facing down the bully at the beach. Here the bully, instead of kicking sand in the weakling's face and calling him skinny, punches him out in front of his 12-year-old daughter when he complains that the bully has broken the rules and taken his company parking space. Instead of following a Charles Atlas regimen, the weakling takes a crash course in martial arts with a former star of grade-C kung fu movies. 
A major reason the film's humor is so pallid is that Mr. Allen, unlike another major movie star with the same last name, isn't the likeliest candidate for the role of a weakling who transforms himself into a he-man. Even playing a bespectacled wimp, Mr. Allen exudes a one-of-the-guys take-charge authority. He is simply incapable of playing the fool or shedding his dignity. In a role that calls for slapstick humiliation, the best Mr. Allen can manage is the brave wide-eyed smile of a man bearing up under persecution. 
His character, Joe Scheffer, is a beleaguered, newly divorced video communications specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company. Denied a promotion and wincing every time he watches his artsy ex-wife, Callie (Kelly Lynch), ostentatiously cuddling with her new boyfriend (Ken Marino), Joe, when pressed to express his feelings, complains he is disappearing. 
After the incident in the parking lot, he plays hooky from work until Meg Harper (Julie Bowen), who runs what's called the ''corporate wellness'' program, is dispatched to his house to persuade him to return and participate in one of her ''anger defusion'' workshops. Joe is catapulted out of his funk by his realization, prompted by Meg, that the one thing in life he wants most is a rematch with the bully, Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton). Her visit also kindles in Joe the first stirrings of a growing romantic interest. 
Once word spreads through the company that Joe is spoiling for a fight, his popularity soars. It turns out everyone has wanted to take a punch at Mark. Joe is invited to play squash with the company's macho in-crowd; beautiful women begin ogling him; and he proves he's a good sport by getting down and funky in a karaoke bar. Before long he is the proud owner of a power suit and a spiffy new Cadillac. 
Observing Joe's transformation from wimp into cool guy, but through critical eyes, is his precociously talented daughter, Natalie (Hayden Panettiere), who sinks into her own funk and refuses to write the school play. 
Directed by John Pasquin from a screenplay by John Scott Shepherd, ''Joe Somebody'' continually squanders its opportunities for hilarity. Especially disappointing are Joe's martial arts lessons with the faded kung fu star Chuck Scarett. Flatly played by Jim Belushi, the character conveys none of the roar of a natural-born fighter. These sequences should have been a Chaplinesque carnival of pratfalls. 
For humor the movie is content to take timid potshots at corporate life. The funniest bit is a satirical commercial for an antidepressant that promises to ''make you better than you really are,'' but whose long list of possible side effects includes almost every alarming symptom you could imagine. The company's driveways are festooned with little round signs bearing icky messages like ''Choose caring'' and ''Choose happiness.'' On one sign a practical joker has scrawled in ''Choose Vicodin.'' 
The real villain of the piece turns out to be Jeremy Callahan (Greg Germann), a power-hungry corporate snake with designs on Meg. When Jeremy boasts of being in prime fighting shape from having taken Jazzercise and Pilates classes, they're obvious buzzwords signaling his effeteness. In the macho ethos of ''Joe Somebody'' only one-on-one combat qualifies as manly. 
''Joe Somebody'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

‽
‽How High‽,‽The clouds of marijuana smoke wafting through ''How High'' are so thick that at moments the haze from all that ganja threatens to obscure the actors' faces. This chaotic mess of a film, starring the rap stars Method Man and Redman as a hip-hop Cheech and Chong, has the disjointed quality of a stoned-out fantasy. Many of the faces that emerge through the murk appear bug-eyed. And much of the dialogue, which is frequently shouted, is only semi-intelligible. The movie, directed by Jesse Dylan from a screenplay by Dustin Lee Abraham, is so loosely constructed that its scenes don't track. 
At heart ''How High'' is a joshing, sardonic ode to ''blunts and booty'' that preaches the same message as a 60's hippie flick exalting the liberating potential of pot, but in a different language. A couple of tokes of magic weed, it suggests, will set you free. Once Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman), two pot-smoking buddies, land at Harvard, the staid university is helpless against the power of their stash, gleaned from a plant nurtured by the ashes of Silas's best friend, Ivory (Chuck Davis), who accidentally incinerated himself. In a matter of weeks Harvard turns into the hardest partying school on the planet. 
The stuff is so potent that when smoked it conjures up the genielike appearance of Ivory himself. It was his omniscient ghost who gave Silas and Jamal the answers to their college entrance exams. Their perfect test scores guaranteed access to any university of their choosing. Near the end of the film Ivory shows up with his new stoned-out buddy in the hereafter, Benjamin Franklin, who is credited with having invented the bong. 
Amid all the jokes about dope and sex, the movie manages to slip in some racial humor. Spalding Gray has a frenetic turn as a ludicrous white professor of black studies who is so guilt ridden that he pleads to his students, ''Lynch me! Lynch me!''  But the villain of the piece is a prudish black professor, Dean Cain (Obba Babatundé), whose grandeur is temporarily punctured when he unsuspectingly munches on some marijuana brownies. Under their influence his inner funkster takes over, and he becomes the gyrating, trash-talking life of the party. 
''How High'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and is crammed with profanity.

‽
‽The Majestic‽,‽A man out of place arrives in a small town and finds himself, while David Ogden Stiers, as Doc, puts one of his caring paws on the confused young fella's shoulder. 
No, it's not the Michael J. Fox vehicle ''Doc Hollywood''; that movie had a sense of humor. This time around it's ''The Majestic,'' which does not. (Imagine if Preston Sturges remade ''Hail the Conquering Hero,'' siphoned out all the humor and replaced it with high-calorie sentimentality.) 
Jim Carrey, stripped of his antic impulse, stands tall, his mouth slightly open with awe, while the camera dollies in to ogle him appreciatively. It's 1951, and he's an amnesiac who has wandered into Lawson, a hamlet in Northern California where the streets are empty, and the local movie theater, the Majestic, has been abandoned since what seems like the advent of talkies. The citizenry is still getting over the number of young men it lost to World War II, and the Majestic is Lawson's decayed crucible of hope. 
Our hero resembles Luke Trimble, a decorated veteran who has gone missing, and Luke's anguished dad, Harry (Martin Landau), clings to the idea that his lost son has come home. In need of a mission, our hero, who comes to believe he is Luke, decides to rebuild the deserted movie palace with the help of the townsfolk and Harry, the owner and projectionist. He does this, in the most languorous way possible, in the most indolent waste of screen time since Andy Warhol's marathon shot of the Empire State Building. It's in the tradition of ''Gee, my dad's got a barn -- let's put on a show.'' This Naugahyde-bound phony will play like a charm on the American Movie Channel, the Jurassic Park of film. 
The director, Frank Darabont, wields metaphors like flashcards and brings to ''The Majestic'' the shopworn back-lot belief in the decency of man that made his ''Green Mile'' such a shabby enterprise. 
In ''The Green Mile,'' set on death row at a Louisiana prison in 1935, we were led to believe that every guard but one was a forward-thinking liberal embarrassed by a shambling, humble black man. In ''The Majestic''  the residents of Lawson discover that Luke is actually Peter Appleton, a screenwriter targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and they rally around him. That's because they know that deep down, like every movie hero, he could never really have been a Communist. And it turns out he wasn't. In the movies everyone is always accused of being a Communist, but no star is ever actually a party member. If there had been as few Communists as American movies on the subject contend, party meetings would have been deserted. 
A few members of the Darabont repertory players, like James Whitmore and Jeffrey DeMunn, acquit themselves well. Gerry Black, as the honorable, decent black man of ''The Majestic,'' does miracles with his deep, gentle voice; mercifully, he isn't sacrificed, as the black Christ figure was in ''The Green Mile.'' 
And rarely has a newcomer been so well served by a movie as Laurie Holden, who plays Adele, Luke's ex-girlfriend. She's given a dream lacquer coat of lip gloss, and the camera blows kisses at her cheekbones. She's beautiful, but her no-nonsense presence is part of her performance, too: Adele has an unshakable authority. 
Mr. Carrey takes to the screen like a star, but that's all the movie asks of him. He plays the same guileless naïf he portrayed in ''The Truman Show''; like many comic actors, when he works in drama, he drains all the joy from the role. A few years ago he gave a capable, thought-out performance in the television movie ''Doing Time on Planet Earth,'' but there he had something to work with. 
In ''The Majestic'' he's just the spark plug for the plot, draped in gorgeous outfits and seated in a polished Mercedes convertible that just screams ''the Past'' -- that indistinct era that makes the 1950's seem like the 1920's or 30's. (Didn't anything ever get dirty or worn in the Past?) 
He is not helped by time-wasting devices like pouring and drinking a glass of water in extremely slow motion. There's a likable parody of grade-Z movie serials, and Peter's eyes shimmer with pride as the actors in the film within the film, including Bruce Campbell as the dimple-chin hero, recite dumb lines Peter wrote way back when. (When Harry runs the film at the Majestic, he tells Peter it's a good movie; too bad the screenwriter, Michael Sloane, didn't seize this chance to show that even the residents of Lawson had some taste.) 
Mr. Carrey has one other good scene at the opening of the film, when he sits in a studio meeting, and we overhear the voices of blustering studio executives with no confidence in anything but their contempt for the American public as they gut a potential project. (Among the offscreen voices are those of Rob Reiner, whose company, Castle Rock, produced ''The Majestic,'' and Garry Marshall.) With its lazy, heavy-handed nostalgia, ''The Majestic'' is just the kind of picture those studio executives would love. 
''The Majestic'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some smooching between Peter and Adele, the clumsy faked violence of the serial and the kind of infelicitous language studio executives are prone to.

‽
‽Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius‽,‽Like a classroom full of fourth graders jacked up on Mountain Dew and Sour Patch Kids -- like its target audience, in other words -- ''Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius'' just can't sit still. The movie, based on the Nickelodeon series of the same name, is so full of whirring gizmos, ricocheting projectiles and giddy hyperactivity that it makes the year's other computer-animated children's movies, ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Shrek,'' seem quiet and contemplative by comparison. 
Following the venerable Nickelodeon formula -- ''Rugrats,'' ''Spongebob Squarepants'' -- ''Jimmy Neutron'' sends a gaggle of bratty, lovable animated figures with disproportionately large heads off on a series of unlikely adventures. To keep accompanying adults amused, the picture is larded with winks, smirks and pop-culture citations intended to sail over the heads of synaptically overloaded youngsters. 
At one point the hero, an energetic young inventor whose full name is James Isaac Neutron, analyzes a note forged by alien invaders over his parents' signature. ''This is nothing like Mom's writing,'' he exclaims. ''The serifs and kerning are all wrong.'' This line sent me straight to the dictionary, but it should nonetheless inspire appreciative chuckles from typesetters in the audience. 
Jimmy lives in a cartoon suburb tongue-in-cheekily called Retroville, which explains both his post-Sputnik gee-whiz approach to science and his parents' hairstyles. Mom in her immovable flip and Dad in his shiny vinyl pompadour seem to have stepped out of a lost animated spin-off combining ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' with ''The Monkees.'' She is a sensible, no-nonsense Laura Petrie, while her husband, with his granny glasses and distracted amiability, seems to have left some of his mind on Venice Beach back in 1966. 
Their son, meanwhile, spends his time in the lab, accompanied by his robot dog, Goddard, tinkering away on useful gadgets: shrink rays, portable jet packs and a toaster-based satellite designed to communicate with alien life-forms. 
The success of this last project spells trouble for Retroville. A race of slimy green egg-shaped creatures, lead by King Goobot and his henchman Ooblar (hammily voiced by Patrick Stewart and Martin Short), picks up the signal and abducts the town's grown-ups. Free of adult supervision, Jimmy and his schoolmates go on an all-night junk-food binge, followed by the inevitable sugar blues, which send them across the galaxy in search of parental guidance. 
This plot turn is handled with a minimum of sentimentality, and it provides a moment of surreal beauty as the children drift through space on airships fashioned out of carnival rides. The hapless grown-ups, meanwhile, are about to be sacrificed to an extraterrestrial poultry god, and a thrilling air battle ensues between Jimmy's plucky young squadron and King Goobot's armada of robot-chicken fighter rockets. 
Aside from Jimmy, Retroville's youth is represented by a well-chosen assortment of schoolyard archetypes. Jimmy's best friends are Carl, a tubby, nervous fellow with heavy glasses and an inhaler, and Sheen, who is geekily obsessed with a video game action hero called Ultra-Lord. Jimmy has an unacknowledged crush on Cindy, the second smartest kid in the class, whose research in evolutionary biology supports a hypothesis of female superiority in the animal kingdom. (Jimmy, in a tense show-and-tell confrontation, questions the objectivity of her research.) Cindy, though, is besotted with Nick, a lollipop-sucking bad boy in denim and prepubescent sideburns. 
''Jimmy Neutron'' is as jam-packed with incident as its frames are stuffed with information. It has the bright Rube Goldberg energy of one of Jimmy's contraptions, and it resists the common kid-movie tendency to lecture its young audience about individuality, self-esteem or other stuff they hear enough about in school. 
The animation, on the other hand, sacrifices warmth and coherence for color and speed. So many images bombard your retinas that none of them makes much of an impression. But maybe I'm hopelessly mired in my own private Retroville. After ''Jimmy Neutron'' was over, I felt glassy-eyed and a little headachy. But the boy genius who accompanied me to the screening could not take his eyes off the screen. I think he's in his room right now, building a shrink ray to try out on his dad.

‽The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring‽,‽There are two groups probably sharing the same dread about the film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ornate and busy ''Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' -- its most loving adherents and those who have spent their lives avoiding the books. But neither side is likely to be disappointed by the director Peter Jackson's altogether heroic job in tackling perhaps the most intimidating nerd/academic fantasy classic ever. 
Given that huge portions of the movie are devoted to exposition (there's a crushing amount of explanation required), Mr. Jackson has simmered the novel down to the most compact action-epic that could be made of it. As director and co-scriptwriter (he wrote the adaptation along with Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh) he understood that what propels the story forward are the battles between the forces of good and evil -- a word from which British stage actors can extract at least three syllables. 
One of those British actors, Ian McKellen, plays Gandalf, the wizard and friend to the Baggins family. Gandalf drops in on the Shire to visit his hobbit friend Bilbo (Ian Holm) on his 111th birthday. (It's good to see Mr. Holm and Sir Ian together, even though the special effect required to make the hobbit diminutive and Gandalf lanky and majestic interferes with their ease.) 
During the celebration, Bilbo passes a ring on to his nephew, Frodo (Elijah Wood), and this ring places Frodo in the center of a struggle for the future of the world. The ring, which contains an evil wizard's ''cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life,'' must be destroyed in the fire Pits of Mordor, where it was created. Even the towering Gandalf is afraid of this master ring. 
''Fellowship'' then slips into a series of chases and pitched battles, each with a bit more at stake because the ring's power to tempt those who come in contact with it becomes a bigger factor. Mr. Jackson has exploited the anecdotal nature by turning ''Fellowship'' into an escalating group of cliffhangers. This is the craftiest way to deal with the essence of ''Fellowship,'' shrinking the border between seduction and greed. When the ring corrupts each side, what's the difference between those who want it to do what's right and those who want it for less selfless reasons? 
Tolkien's books were written and passed around from zealot to zealot long before fantasy became the order of the day in contemporary popular culture, which is why so much of ''Fellowship'' will seem familiar to those who know nothing about them. (Tolkien devotees are probably still wiping the bad taste of Ralph Bakshi's poky 1978 animated adaptation from their mouths.) 
Rather than emphasize the similarities to George Lucas's mythology, Mr. Jackson gallops straight through them, trimming away as many of the complications as possible. ''Fellowship'' may still feel like ''Star Wars'' and just about every other otherworldly battle epic of the last 30 years -- a whopping composite of Christian allegory, Norse mythology and a boys' book of adventure. There's not much of a place for women on the loamy, rich dream scapes of Middle Earth; they enter the action briefly as if they were dream figures, part of the film's subconscious, like the glorious Elf queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the magical Arwen (Liv Tyler). 
''Fellowship'' centers on a band composed of the hobbits Frodo and his best friend, Sam (Sean Astin); the wizard Gandalf; and a pack of warriors that include the humans Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean), the angry dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the elf archer Legolas (Armando Bloom). 
Mr. Jackson apparently feels that the way to keep each of the fighting groups separate in the audience's minds is to provide them with hairstyles reminiscent of 1970's bands. The hobbits all have heads of tossled curls -- they're like members of Peter Frampton's group. Aragorn and Boromir have the long, unwashed bushes of Aerosmith, and the flaxen-maned Legolas has the fallen-angel look of one of the Allman Brothers. (The tubby, bilious and bearded Gimli could be a roadie for any of them.) ''Fellowship'' plays like a sword-and-sorcery epic produced by VH-1. Together, they rock against the forces of Sauron -- the evil wizard who created the Ring that Frodo holds. They have to pass through a cavernous passageway to fight through the assortment of nightmare creatures that Sauron sends to stop them. 
In Tolkien's book, each obstacle represents what is by now a kitschy level of enlightenment; once it's surmounted, you can never go back. Though this sadder-but-wiser educational experience is integral to the story, rather than snip it away, the director lingers on the mournfulness. When Frodo's band of brothers has to endure its sacrifices, the movie has a sense of loss. Mr. Jackson gets more feeling into ''Fellowship'' than he did with his previous films, like ''Heavenly Creatures'' and the bracing shock comedy ''Dead Alive'' and ''The Frighteners'' (which contained milder elements from ''Dead Alive''). He's better at this stuff than the happy shenanigans at Bilbo's birthday bash in the Shire; it's an entire village of comic relief. Mr. Jackson is a deft filmmaker, though, combining humor and horror in the same scene -- so that the actors' takes of disbelief when yet another menace materializes are so expressive they seem like part of the storytelling. 
The movie gets going once the quest begins and the adventurers hit the road. Since the actors serve a plot need rather than filling out characterization, the movie succeeds when the performers quickly communicate their functions. Mr. Wood's light, tremulous voice for Frodo and earnest, pointed face offer decency. He sometimes seems to possess the visage that Michael Jackson has spent a lot of money having sculptured by man-made means. 
Sir Ian's good-humored courtliness goes a long way, especially in his scenes with his former mentor-turned-nemesis, the wizard Saruman; he's played by Christopher Lee as if he were still Dracula rising from the grave. Mr. Mortensen's tendency to withhold as an actor informs Aragorn's nobility, and he moves well with a sword; it gives him an action hero's passion, which contrasts with Bean's conflicted Boromir. 
If the actors had more to do, the picture might run longer than its current 165 minutes. At that length some may find the movie exhausting, since those not caught up in the story -- which will seem reiterative because Tolkien's prose has been pillaged so often -- may find themselves indifferent to ''Fellowship.'' The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned. 
''Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' is rated PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned) for the plethora of menacing creatures who eventually have to be encountered and slaughtered.

‽
‽Not Another Teen Movie‽,‽An English class at John Hughes High School. The teacher, interrupted by a burst of flatulence from one of his students and a burst of laughter from the rest of them, launches into an impassioned tirade against the younger generation's sense of humor. Meanwhile, three clumsy, sex-crazed freshmen are perched in an air duct above the girls' bathroom, where they witness a young woman's intestinal distress. 
As the teacher winds up his speech, he invokes Shakespeare, Molière, and the tradition of ''sublime poetic genius,'' which today's youth has abandoned in favor of a fascination with ''human excrement.'' Q.E.D.: no sooner does he utter these words than the air duct collapses, followed by the floor of the toilet stall, a cataclysm that douses the poor man's classroom in something other than sublime poetic genius. 
One's response to this scene is anticipated by the title of the movie in which it occurs. ''Not Another Teen Movie'' is a raunchy send-up both of raunchy teen comedies like ''American Pie'' and of their sweet, romantic step-siblings. It is, in other words, a parody of parodies, of self-parodies and of itself. It makes fun of toilet humor while indulging in it and mocks slobbery adolescent prurience while displaying plenty of naked female flesh. (There is, for example, a foreign exchange student named Areola, who walks the halls of J.H.H.S. wearing nothing but a backpack, at once poking fun at the ''American Pie'' movies and going further than they dared to.) 
Directed by Joel Gallen, who cut his teeth producing the MTV movie awards, ''Not Another Teen Movie'' is a happy, nasty and frequently hilarious assault on 20 years' worth of youth pictures. That these movies have become a tradition unto themselves is acknowledged in frequent homages to Mr. Hughes. At the school that bears his name, the football team plays in Harry Dean Stadium (whose sad-sack-dad role is lampooned by Randy Quaid), and the students eat lunch in Anthony Michael Hall (the sad-sack-best-friend role is lampooned by Eric Jungmann). 
Molly Ringwald, the Ingrid Bergman of Reagan-era American adolescence, appears in a late cameo as a cynical, foul-mouthed flight attendant. (Her sad-sack-sensitive-rebel-girl role is lampooned by Chyler Leigh.) Paul Gleason, who played the corrupt disciplinarian in ''The Breakfast Club,'' shows up to lampoon himself in a reprise of one of that film's famous scenes. 
Mr. Hughes's movies are scrambled with their more recent derivations, especially the towering oeuvre of Freddie Prinze Jr., the Tab Hunter of Clinton-era adolescence, here impersonated by Chris Evans. The soundtrack, hairstyles and clothes reflect this collision of zeitgeists. The main story line, such as it is, commingles the plot of Mr. Prinze's first big hit, ''She's All That,'' with Mr. Hughes's ''Pretty in Pink'' and also makes reference to some of Mr. Prinze's other work, like that movie where he plays the guy who, like, falls in love with this girl and then, like, umm, I forget. 
Among the five credited writers are Phil Beauman and Buddy Johnson, able spoofers whose résumés include the ''Scary Movie'' movies and the faux-neo-blaxploitation epic ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.'' Like those pictures, this one demonstrates a knack for hitting easy targets. 
''Not Another Teen Movie'' is a parade of archetypes, from the Bitchy Cheerleader (Jaime Pressly) to the Dumb Fat Guy (Ron Lester) to the Token Black Guy (Deon Richmond), who is on hand to contribute dated hip-hop slang. (The T.B.G. is a recent addition to the teen-pic formula; the Chicago suburbs in Mr. Hughes's movies were so white that Ms. Ringwald could seem exotically ethnic.) 
The racial bad faith of recent youth cinema is also twitted when Mr. T. turns up on the sidelines of the Big Game as ''the wise janitor'' who dispenses sage advice that will enable the hero to learn valuable life lessons. 
Mr. Gallen keeps the gags moving along, and inserts some clever, if obvious, swipes at the visual conventions of pubescent cinema: the slow-motion pretty-girl entrance, the raucous party scene, the tender father-daughter heart to heart. He and his partners also have the good sense to extend the teen movie rubric to include ''American Beauty,'' represented by a weirdo with a cam-corder who is followed around by a plastic bag labeled ''the most beautiful thing in the world.'' 
In a climactic motel room showdown, after the Popular Jock (a k a the reformed cool guy, a k a the Freddie Prinze Jr. character) has punched out the Cocky Blond Guy, the cheerleader and the weirdo, he takes a swing at the bag. ''I don't know what this is for,'' he says. Maybe not, but it's the most sublime piece of film criticism I've seen in some time. 
''Not Another Teen Movie'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Such language! Such behavior! Kids these days!

‽Vanilla Sky‽,‽Those teeth! Those abs! That shining, perfectly coiffed helmet from which the 33-year-old protagonist of ''Vanilla Sky'' meticulously plucks a single, offending, all-but-invisible gray hair! Who else could play the vainest, cockiest young master of the universe ever to strut across the screen wearing an obnoxiously triumphant grin but Tom Cruise, that high-strung human racehorse oozing ambition like perspiration? 
Yes, ''Vanilla Sky'' is a timely fable about male vanity. The message of the film, which reunites the star with Cameron Crowe, who directed him in ''Jerry Maguire,'' isn't exactly reassuring. Looks are everything, it says, with money (preferably oodles of it) a close second. But if you lose your looks, all the money in the world won't mean diddly unless it can somehow buy them back. 
In this highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory, Mr. Cruise emerges from a near-fatal car crash with a grotesquely disfigured face. Then, through a miracle of cosmetic surgery, his beauty and the perfect love it once attracted are restored. Or so it seems. 
Two-thirds of the way through the film, what began as a fairly conventional allegory of a soulless cad's spiritual redemption turns into a swatch of science fiction that owes a great deal to the classic coneheads episode of ''Star Trek.'' To say much more would be to spoil the guilty pleasure of a movie whose barreling narrative drive and soundtrack (a rich musical stew that recalls the Beatles' ''White Album'') partly camouflage a multitude of flaws. 
''Vanilla Sky'' has been faithfully adapted from the Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenábar's 1997 romantic thriller ''Abre los Ojos'' (''Open Your Eyes'') into a star vehicle for Mr. Cruise, its story transplanted to New York City from Spain and amplified by a blockbuster budget. Redemption (by true love or a heroic exercise of will) has been the theme of some of Mr. Cruise's biggest hits, and here it takes on a more personal resonance than in any of his previous films. 
When we first meet Mr. Cruise's character, David Aames, his only worries besides those troublesome strands of gray are his terrifying nightmares. In the first of the film's several flashy dream sequences, David finds himself running in panic through a deserted Times Square. The early scenes show David wallowing gleefully in the gargantuan millennial equivalent of a Playboy penthouse. His palace on the Upper West Side of Manhattan has acres of space and fine art (including a Monet painting with a ''vanilla sky''). 
The morning after a night of passion, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), David's newest plaything in an endless succession of beautiful women, goes over the moon about his prowess as a lover. But for David, an affair that seems about to burst into true love is strictly recreational. David is so indifferent to Julie he doesn't bother inviting her to his 33rd birthday bash. He is mildly irritated when she crashes the party and observes him flirting with Sofia Serrano (Penélope Cruz), the date of David's best friend, sidekick and sycophantic doormat, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee). 
But Sofia, a dancer, seems to exude a special radiance. Or as David crows, she is ''the last guileless woman in New York.'' Overnight, the man who had everything but true love finally has it all. Leaving Sofia's apartment the next morning, David is surprised to find Julie waiting outside in a car to offer him a lift. In the film's most powerful scene, she lets him have it, becoming increasingly unstrung with jealousy and rage as she guns the accelerator and drives the vehicle off a bridge in a suicide leap. 
Days later, David emerges from a coma, afflicted with blinding headaches and with one side of his face disfigured. The best his team of doctors can do is to provide him with a flesh-colored latex mask. In a scene reminiscent of Mr. Cruise's most anguished moments in ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' David freaks out in a disco and ends up abandoned in a gutter by Sofia and Brian. 
Here the story abruptly wanders into alien territory, as David, wearing the mask, finds himself questioned by a sympathetic doctor (Kurt Russell) in a mysterious interrogation room. Racing against time, David must come up with evidence that he wasn't responsible for Julie's death. ''Vanilla Sky'' turns into a Hitchcockian riddle, at times reminiscent of ''North by Northwest'' and ''Vertigo,'' that takes a giant, awkward leap into allegorical science fiction. 
As it leaves behind the real world and begins exploring life as a waking dream (this year's most popular theme in Hollywood movies with lofty ideas), ''Vanilla Sky'' loosens its emotional grip and becomes a disorganized and abstract if still-intriguing meditation on parallel themes. One is the quest for eternal life and eternal youth; another is guilt and the ungovernable power of the unconscious mind to undermine science's utopian discoveries. David's redemption ultimately consists of his coming to grips with his own mortality, but that redemption lacks conviction. 
Mr. Cruise so dominates the film with his taut, intensely focused drive that ''Vanilla Sky'' takes on an autobiographical resonance. For all its allegorical weight, the question haunting the film's subtext is how much longer Hollywood's ranking proto-yuppie, now 39, can get away with playing boy wonders straining after record-breaking achievements. 
What carries the movie is Mr. Cruise's impeccable marathon-man star turn in a performance that is characteristically icy beneath a bluff, glittering, ever-boyish charm. Ms. Cruz, reprising the role she played in the original Spanish film, has no problem conveying her character's guilelessness, but her performance is seriously weakened by barely competent English-language line readings that are just one step above phonetic pronunciation. 
Many viewers will be hard pressed to see why David prefers Sofia over Julie, especially since Ms. Diaz gives so ferociously emotional a performance. The movie also loses crucial stamina in the plodding dialogues between David and the psychiatrist, played by a miscast Mr. Russell. 
With its roller-coaster plot and surreal special effects, ''Vanilla Sky'' is not the kind of film one associates with Mr. Crowe. The most warm-hearted of mainstream Hollywood directors, Mr. Crowe has in the past extended to his characters the affection of an unusually careful and sympathetic listener. That tenderness was never more palpable than in ''Almost Famous,'' his gently rose-tinted remembrance of the early-70's rock culture and his years as a teenage music journalist. 
In the often forced-sounding dialogue in ''Vanilla Sky,'' that ear is not as sharp. Still, the movie carries a lingering tug of sweetness. It is most apparent in the film's heady soundtrack, which includes choice nuggets of R.E.M., Peter Gabriel, early Bob Dylan and Todd Rundgren and a lovely wisp of a Paul McCartney song especially written for the movie. More than any other element, the soundtrack evokes the dream of eternal youth that infuses ''Vanilla Sky.'' The music guides us to the movie's heart. 
''Vanilla Sky'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, strong language and mild violence.

‽
‽The Business of Strangers‽,‽Whether exuding Manhattan-style noblesse oblige in ''Six Degrees of Separation'' or Washington-style political clout in ''The West Wing,'' Stockard Channing embodies the sort of patrician grandeur that actors like Mary Astor and Barbara Stanwyck conjured in their more upscale movie roles. And in ''The Business of Strangers,'' Patrick Stettner's chilly corporate nightmare, her aristocratic command inflects her portrait of a hardened, lonely American businesswoman at the top of her game with a hint of tragedy. 
When we first meet Ms. Channing's character, Julie Styron, she is on the way from an airport to a hotel to make an important presentation. Informed by cellphone that her company's chief executive has unexpectedly flown in for a personal meeting, Julie automatically assumes she is about to be fired and arranges a hasty interview with a slippery corporate headhunter, Nick Harris (Frederick Weller), who offers guarded encouragement. 
To make matters worse, Julie's new technical assistant, Paula Murphy (Julia Stiles), who is bringing the materials for the presentation, arrives 45 minutes late, and afterward Julie angrily fires her. But at the dreaded top-level meeting Julie is shocked to find herself promoted instead of fired. After decades of working her way up the ladder, she is finally No. 1. Later at the hotel bar she runs into Paula, and over many celebratory Scotches the two women develop an edgy friendship that takes an unexpected turn when Nick appears and Paula persuades Julie to invite him back to her suite for a possible threesome. 
The fun and games turn nasty when Paula confides to Julie that she has met Nick before, although he seems not to recognize her. At a party several years ago, Paula says, Nick raped her best friend. Outraged, Julie agrees against her better judgment to collaborate in a booze-fueled revenge improvised by Paula that becomes increasingly sadistic and ends up risking everything to vent a lifetime of pent-up rage against the male-dominated corporate pecking order. The scary, out-of-control punishment the two women wreak is complicated by the ambiguous sexual crosscurrents flowing between them. 
''The Business of Strangers'' has been described as the female answer to ''In the Company of Men,'' Neil LaBute's scorching satire in which two male office mates cruelly take out their accumulated rage on an innocent young woman by aggressively courting, then brutally dumping her. Where ''The Business of Strangers'' raises many of the same lurking demons, it isn't as incisive or as controlled as its forerunner, which had the impeccable structure of a modern Restoration comedy. In addressing date rape, this film also misses the note-perfect tone of Stephen Belber's screenplay for ''Tape.'' 
The problem with ''The Business of Strangers'' is that it doesn't know where to draw the line. At first Paula appears to be a nervy young truth teller whose contemptuous view of corporate life and the role of women seems precociously embittered. But as Paula's revenge escalates in viciousness, two surprise twists in the story make us question her credibility, and it appears she might be deranged. Her metamorphosis from ultra-cool to possibly insane recalls the transformation undergone by Glenn Close's lethal stalker in ''Fatal Attraction,'' although the two characters' sexual agendas are almost diametrically opposed. 
Ms. Stiles, with her small, deep-set eyes (reminiscent of Ms. Close's) and Jane Fonda voice, imbues Paula with a formidable, ultimately frightening bravado. Ms. Stiles brings a focused intelligence and vocal command to her portrayal that suggest she is the actress of her generation most likely to inherit the kind of powerhouse roles associated with Ms. Close and Ms. Fonda in their 30's and 40's. 
Ms. Channing's complicated, finely layered performance looks deep into Julie's soul. Where a less sensitive interpretation might have made the character a pitiably lonely career woman (single, menopausal, childless and terminally hard-boiled), Ms. Channing allows us to admire Julie's strength, poise and sense of accomplishment. As tough and bruised as she may be, Julie is no man-hating dragon lady. When Paula savagely baits her about the choices she has made in her life, Julie convincingly stands up for herself. 
Mr. Weller's Nick, far from being a cartoonish male chauvinist, is a glittering-eyed reptilian smoothie who keeps his cards close to his vest and conveys the wary charm of a conniving predator who is far less secure than he pretends. 
The film's performances are matched in power by its surreal, hellish vision of corporate life as an impersonal killing field in which the wounds are camouflaged by a suffocating blandness. Most of the movie is set in airport waiting rooms awash in stale canned music and anonymous hotel suites whose well-stocked minibars glint with inviting anesthetics. 
The paved-over suburban wasteland in which the movie takes place is everywhere and nowhere in America. The hotel itself is a hideous tower of greenish glass blocks looming incongruously against the sky. In the airport waiting room and hotel bar you feel the gaping distance between people who sit alone, blank-faced and brooding, in a kind of purgatorial void. When human contact takes place, the language is either harsh, impersonal corporate-speak or the raucous alcoholic camaraderie of nervously competitive men in packs. 
With an intensity that few movies have mustered, ''The Business of Strangers'' makes you feel the acute loneliness of it all, the empty pit-of-your-stomach feeling of being lost on the road in a world of masks with only your own ambition and gnawing paranoia for companionship. 
''The Business of Strangers'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual situations. 
‽
‽Ocean's Eleven‽,‽IT would be hard to make a movie worse than the first ''Ocean's Eleven,'' the 1960 Lewis Milestone film. Who remembers that it was the man responsible for the powerful, dogmatic antiwar film ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' who was being led around by the ring-a-ding leader of the Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra? 
Steven Soderbergh, who directed the remake, understood that all he had to do was show some finesse and he could get away with this low-blood-pressure heist picture, keeping the tiny germ of a story about hitting three Las Vegas casinos. Still, he rallies a seismic jolt of enthusiasm, and the movie is an elating blaze of flair and pride. 
Mr. Soderbergh has assembled a cast list that reads like a Who's Who of People magazine's Sexiest Men Alive: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia.  And as the Girl there's the biggest star of them all, Julia Roberts. For a little dramatic tension in the alphabetical above-the-title credits, her name comes last. This listing may be the closest thing to actual tension the film provides moviegoers, since Mr. Soderbergh is not about to dilute the good will his extraordinarily charismatic cast seduces out of the audience. 
The director comes through, too, by investing the film with his considerable skills. He must have realized this would be a delicate task; the film is a misstep away from Hal Needham's ''Cannonball Run,'' which Mr. Soderbergh has joked about in interviews as a movie in which the cast members enjoyed themselves and spared audiences any such delight. (The biggest question in the original ''Ocean's Eleven'' was not whether the thieves would succeed with the score, but whether they could get through the movie with a straight face.) 
Mr. Clooney, the logical heir to Sinatra's private-jet charm, portrays Danny Ocean, Chairman of the Bored. Sinatra, who played Ocean the first time around, may have been the first jazz actor, but he never showed the attention span to go with the talent. Mr. Clooney does. His line readings are choice: he never raises his voice, which is all velvet arrogance with a minimum of fuss. 
While being shown out of prison at the beginning of the film, he is reissued the garb he was wearing when arrested: a tuxedo, which looks as if the prison folks were nice enough to have cleaned and pressed. (Wisely, the movie cuts a dialogue exchange that remains in the trailer and television spots, in which Ocean insults the parole board.) 
He finds his ex-partner, Rusty (Mr. Pitt), teaching poker to hot young actors, playing themselves: Shane West, Joshua Jackson and Topher Grace, whose turn as a spoiled, jabbering, coddled crackhead in Mr. Soderbergh's ''Traffic'' last year may have been the only unheralded exercise of talent in the picture. This slight joke is a tutorial on star power to the youths trying to occupy the grown-up space that comes easily to Danny and Rusty. 
Danny plans to steal the take from three casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Mr. Garcia), a store of cash with security to rival that of ''most nuclear missile silos.'' Danny also wants to get the attention of his ex-wife, Tess (Ms. Roberts), who works for Benedict and is involved with him. Danny needs a team for this mammoth job, which will call for an assortment of cons to set up the robbery itself. 
This ''Ocean's Eleven'' may want to distance itself from the original, but it's crammed with not-so-subtle throwbacks to the Rat Pack, like the picture's tag line, ''Are you in or out?,'' a riff on the koo-koo cool of the Pack and a variation on a line Mr. Clooney uses. (The first ''Ocean's Eleven'' did have one gorgeous flourish: a map of the casinos to be hit was painted on a swath of silk.) 
Of course, both films are really about the same thing: manicured, superbly outfitted masculinity. One gets the feeling Rusty wouldn't need to be a part of the robbery if he didn't slip into a new piece of couture fabulosity three times a day, which coincides with the unspoken code of the 1960 version. Still, Mr. Pitt never does so well as when he is lingering around the comic criminal demimonde; making fun of his own narcissism in ''Snatch'' and ''True Romance'' is a bright joke. And here, in every scene he's in, he's munching on junk food like fries or popcorn. 
The cast is having a gas, and the actors who play for broad comedy hit their targets hard and repeatedly. As Reuben Tishkoff, a macher who has reasons of his own for getting back at Benedict, Elliott Gould looks, and acts, like a borscht belt bear. (His brassy intonations are reminiscent of the Linda Richman character Mike Myers used to do on ''Saturday Night Live.'') 
Carl Reiner is the curdled, retired hood Saul Bloom, and he peppers his performance with a disgust that looks as if it's powered by heartburn. Eddie Jemison, a find from Mr. Soderbergh's underseen ''Schizopolis,'' is a jittery electronics expert -- one of several, apparently. 
And as a screen actor, the comic Bernie Mac gets better and better. As Frank Catton, card dealer and scam artist, he has trimmed away his stand-up act's noisy busyness and holds his own; he bristles with authority. 
Some of the other, bigger talents are marooned by the material. Don Cheadle's demolition expert is dressed as if he'll later be disc jockeying at an underground club. He takes on a slipshod cockney accent that goes in and out; you wait to hear that it's a put-on. 
And Mr. Damon is supposed to be the Kid. (He is the youngest of the group, though not much younger than Mr. Pitt or Mr. Clooney.) He tries to connote youth by crimping his own style. With the really young actors used as a joke earlier in the film, it's almost as if the movie is trying to put Mr. Damon in the same uncomfortable position as Robert Redford in ''The Sting'' when he was too old to play the Kid role. (It might have been more fun to have seen Mr. Grace in this role.) 
Mr. Damon does light it up in a scene with Mr. Mac, but he and Ms. Roberts get to have the least fun because they have to show more maturity. Her schoolmarmish role seems almost an afterthought to compensate for the original's no-girls-allowed misogyny. 
This movie is an odd choice for Mr. Soderbergh, who is perhaps the ne plus ultra director of films about people living on the margins. His debut, ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' was so much about outsiders that one of its characters pressed a video camera to the window instead of his nose. I'm not sure why he chose to remake ''Ocean's Eleven,'' a movie so much about insiders that the stars of the original couldn't have cared less if there was an audience for the picture. And as it turns out, there wasn't much of one for the original, a ''Rififi'' swaddled in sharkskin and platinum slave bracelets. 
Mr. Soderbergh seems to make a different-looking movie on each occasion he gets behind the camera, though he does fall back on the stuttered, elided edits purloined from Jean-Luc Godard's splintered cuts. (He is as intrigued by playing around with time as Mr. Godard is, and does so here by layering the film with flashbacks.) 
But Mr. Soderbergh does some of his best work in ''Ocean's Eleven,'' working with a ticking suavity he tried to bring to lesser movies like ''The Underneath.'' 
He has a breathtaking amount of technique at his fingertips, aided immensely by the popping freshness of the score by David Holmes, who he worked with successfully on ''Out of Sight.'' Mr. Holmes scales his rhythms to the picture's pace, giving the movie a heartbeat. 
Mr. Soderbergh's cinematography adds a candy-colored snap; the tints come out of a pack of Jolly Ranchers. The color scheme balances the bland phoniness of the current Vegas, which functions as a welcome mat for all ages in contrast with the old-school menace of the city, a Fifth Amendment playground. (It may be why Sinatra wanted the original to have a downer ending it didn't earn.) 
The remake takes on a breeziness that trumps its vacancy; it's the world's largest hollow chocolate bunny. The city's own inauthenticity dovetails neatly with the picture's shiny artifice. 
This film is so brazenly showbizzy that everyone seems to be in costume. It depends on hard work and movie star combustion and gets by because the actors bring verve and professionalism to the enterprise. 
That they're better than the lackluster material isn't a given, and you may end up trying to fight their considerable charms. But even those potentially repelled by the in-jokes and raffishness may go along. 
For those not so taken by the star power, this new ''Ocean's Eleven'' is the equivalent of a domineering team you can't stand that enters the Super Bowl. Even if you don't like the players, the odds are so good that it's tough to bet against them. 
''Ocean's Eleven'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for cool-for-cats strong language, violence as fake as the shag carpeting and low-ball visual jokes.

‽
‽Texas Rangers‽,‽''Let them remember us not as men of vengeance but as men of law and justice.'' This noble sentiment, punctuated by a heart-rending tubercular cough, is intoned by Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), brave leader of the Texas Rangers, near the end of Steve Miner's movie of that name. The rangers themselves may be worthy of commemoration, but this violent meatball western deserves to be forgotten quickly, which seems to be just what its distributor, Dimension Films, had in mind when it snuck the movie into theaters yesterday with no advance screening. 
McNelly's words are an absurd, belated attempt to have it both ways. Even as it wags a finger at vigilantism and half-heartedly endorses due process, ''Texas Rangers'' is an orgy of revenge killing under the badge of legal authority on the wild Texas-Mexico border in 1875. 
McNelly is a downcast, shadow-faced ex-preacher who lost his family to bandits and who, as head of the rangers, favors summary executions and disdains taking prisoners. One ranger, a bookish man named Lincoln Rogers Dunnison (James Van Der Beek), is troubled by his methods. By the end each has learned something: Dunnison can enjoy plugging the bad hombre who killed his parents, and McNelly can, after killing many bad guys himself, consider the virtues of a fair trial. 
The moral of ''Texas Rangers'' is as confused as everything else in it. Mr. Miner and his screenwriters throw in enough horse-opera clichés to shame the makers of ''Gunsmoke.'' There are a few modern twists, of course, like the casting of almost-hot young television and pop music talent in the heartthrob roles. 
In addition to Mr. Van Der Beek, the title character in ''Dawson's Creek,'' there is Ashton Kutcher of ''That 70's Show'' and the R&amp;B singer Usher Raymond. Mr. Raymond plays Randolph Douglas Scipio, the only black in the ranger company. 
The rangers are after a bad hombre named John King Fisher, gleefully played by Alfred Molina. His gang kidnaps a character described in the production notes as ''the smoldering Perdita.'' 
Rachael Leigh Cook embodies chaste and sensible Texas womanhood and surprises Mr. Van Der Beek and Mr. Kutcher in a bathtub together. (I wish it were as interesting as it sounds.) At the end she stands at the grave of some rangers and says, ''I can't help but think they're watching.'' Well, if somebody has to, it's better them than you. 
''Texas Rangers'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a lot of killing and some mild cowboy swearing.

‽The Affair of the Necklace‽,‽According to no less an authority than Napoleon Bonaparte, the events related in ''The Affair of the Necklace,'' a new movie directed by Charles Shyer, were among the main causes of the French Revolution. You will have to take Napoleon's word for it, since this swooshy, bejewelled period melodrama sheds precious little light on the political history of France. This in itself need not be a major failing, since movies set in the 18th century have much to offer besides historical instruction -- women in tight bodices, men in wigs, and elegantly turned-out people laughing uproariously at remarks that don't sound, to our vulgar modern ears, funny at all. 
''The Affair of the Necklace'' has all of these things, and enough velvet and brocade to swath every bosom from here to Versailles, where its plot unfolds in the expected atmosphere of aristocratic decadence. The court is ruled by the haughty, naughty Marie Antoinette (Joely Richardson), whose favor our heroine, one Jeanne de la Motte-Valois (Hilary Swank), most ardently desires. Most ardently indeed! (This, by the way, was how people talked in the 18th century.) 
By the efficient use of printed titles, voice-over narration, a childhood flashback and several long speeches, it is established that Jeanne was robbed of her birthright and her parents by royal soldiers. She arrives at the court of Louis XVI clutching a copy of her family tree and hoping that her title, honor and property will be restored. A dashing young gigolo named Retaux de la Villette (Simon Baker) comes to her aid, and together they hatch the scheme that gives the movie its title. 
To put briefly what Mr. Shyer and the screenwriter, John Sweet, put as laboriously as possible, Jeanne forges a series of letters from Marie Antoinette to the lecherous Cardinal Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), who desperately wants to be prime minister. Jeanne soon finds herself the prime mover of a vast conspiracy that includes not only herself and Villette, but also her dissolute husband, Nicolas (Adrien Brody), and the shady Cagliostro, a Rasputin-like figure who is reputed to be the head of the German Illuminati and who could be played only by Christopher Walken. The necklace itself is a ravishing bauble designed by the royal jewelers for the ill-fated neck of Marie Antoinette, and it becomes the prize in Jeanne's ruthless long con. 
All of this could be quite entertaining, either in the swashbuckling ''Three Musketeers'' vein -- there is a brief interlude of swordplay -- or in the erotic chess-match mode of ''Dangerous Liaisons.'' But the filmmakers' interest in the fashion and furniture of the era never extends to politics, sexual mores or social life, and what is worse, they are unable to wrest a coherent story from the historical record. ''The Affair of the Necklace'' drags and meanders when it wants clarity and clockwork, and bogs down in hazy, vague emotions. 
The biggest problem is in the character of Jeanne herself. To have conceived a plot that involved the manipulation of two powerful figures and to have dared to put it into action must have required a degree of calculation and sang-froid that never registers in Ms. Swank's performance. She and Mr. Shyer are so intent on making Jeanne sympathetic -- that flashback of the soldiers sacking her childhood home and killing her father is repeated several times throughout the movie -- that she seems more like a trembling victim than an ingenious plotter. 
To rise above the ridiculousness of the material would have required figuring out how to make Jeanne into a heroine, and Ms. Swank has a timid, indecisive manner that shrinks the character. With her angular cheekbones and wide lips, she looks a little like Julia Roberts, but she utterly lacks Ms. Roberts's reckless movie-star sass. 
The earnest ineptitude of the picture makes it all the more painful to watch gifted actors like Mr. Pryce and Brian Cox, who plays the scowling House Minister Breteuil, waste gravity and conviction on roles that could be saved only by parody. Mr. Pryce, who has been making something of a habit of bad costume drama, glowers and sighs and quite literally rips a bodice, shortly after dismounting from a galloping horse, no less, and yet he seems to take no pleasure in any of it. 
The only actors who relieve the tedium are the ones who decline to take the proceedings seriously. Mr. Brody overacts with a loose bravado somewhere between Tom Jones and Blackadder, and reminds us that all that lechery and dissolution could be fun sometimes. And then there is Mr. Walken, who seems to be enjoying himself a great deal at the movie's expense. He is outfitted with facial hair that appears to have been made of industrial vinyl and a hairdo that owes more to science fiction than to costume drama. Every time the camera moves his way, it seems to interrupt a deep reverie, and as soon as Mr. Walken opens his mouth your overwhelming impulse is to burst out laughing. 
As he did last summer in ''America's Sweethearts,'' Mr. Walken imports a deep mischief that this dim, hesitant picture cannot contain. If no studio will back a sequel devoted to the adventures of Cagliostro, maybe Spike Jonze or the good people at ''Saturday Night Live,'' who have made good use of Mr. Walken's anarchic sense of comedy in the past, will find a home for him. 
''The Affair of the Necklace'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are some violent scenes, and several ripped and otherwise unfastened bodices.

‽
‽Behind Enemy Lines‽,‽''Behind Enemy Lines,'' a taut wartime rescue thriller that sustains a relentless buzzing energy, feels very much of the moment, even though it is set in the Balkans and not in Afghanistan. 
Directed by John Moore, from a screenplay by David Veloz and Zak Penn, it provides about as intense an immersion in military ambience as a Hollywood movie could hope to provide in just over 90 minutes. Even with its occasional lapses into melodramatic fakery, its cool, machine-tooled mixture of jargon, gadgetry, offhanded machismo and war-is-hell imagery feels far more authentic than in most Hollywood war movies. 
Without excessive flag-waving or patriotic bluster, ''Behind Enemy Lines'' plays into the new spirit of gung-ho militancy that has swept the nation since Sept. 11. Its two heroes, Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), a talented naval aviator, and his commander, Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman), who leads the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson, are seasoned military men, each with a renegade streak. When the going gets tough, both are willing to risk their careers to defy authority. 
Although the movie is basically a cut-and-dried thriller, it sends an implicit message that blind obedience to military command isn't always the best policy and that a judicious flouting of the rules is sometimes the nobler choice. 
As the story begins, the war in Bosnia is winding to a close. A joint coalition of American and NATO forces is overseeing the cease-fire. In a few days the Americans are scheduled to leave the area. 
The NATO commander, Admiral Piquet (Joaquim de Almeida), although sharing the same rank with Reigart, is technically his superior, and a subplot of the movie follows the personal power struggle between the two that has subtle global implications. 
Reigart and Burnett have their own conflicts. Burnett, who has served in the Navy for eight years without seeing any action, has reluctantly decided to leave military service out of sheer boredom and frustration. Reigart is disappointed about the prospect of losing his best naval aviator, and as punishment, on Christmas Eve, he dispatches Burnett and a pilot, Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), on the kind of routine, usually fruitless reconnaissance mission that Burnett has flown many times before. 
This time, however, Burnett spots some suspicious activity on the ground and decides to fly outside his authorized airspace to photograph it. His plane is immediately shot down, and Burnett and Stackhouse escape by parachute. From the edge of the woods where his chute lands, Burnett watches in horror as Stackhouse is surrounded, captured and summarily executed by Serbian soldiers. Burnett's half-stifled shout of horror at the killing alerts the soldiers to his presence, and he becomes the object of a manhunt that takes up most of the rest of the movie. 
As Burnett makes his way across the rugged wintry terrain toward a safe area, he is pursued by Serbian gunmen. But he is also able to establish radio contact with Reigart, who overrides Piquet's instructions and dispatches a rescue party. 
It's all in the details, as they say. And while ''Behind Enemy Lines'' has no ideas or philosophy to speak of in its adrenaline-fueled head, it conveys a steady visceral charge from its opening moments to its predictably triumphal finale. As Burnett scuttles through the forest, you feel his continually changing chemistry of panic, exhilaration and determination. In the movie's most gruesome moment, his only hope for survival is to bury himself in mud and play dead in a ditch festooned with rotting corpses. 
The jittery action scenes, filmed with hand-held cameras, are so realistic that some of movie's computerized special effects, while deployed with unusual deftness, still seem artificial and ultimately unnecessary. 
The sense of realism is immeasurably bolstered by the performances of the two leads. The choice of Mr. Wilson, who has starred in three Wes Anderson films, might seem an odd one. But the young actor's eccentricities help humanize his character, and you sense the streak of the wild, reckless good ol' boy in Burnett that helps make him a natural fighter. 
Here, as in almost every movie in which he appears, Mr. Hackman is a natural. With no visible effort, he infuses his rather stock character with a complex personal psychology. Stoic and hard-bitten on the surface but passionately independent underneath and devoted to the welfare of his men, he may be close to an ideal commander. But Mr. Hackman's understated performance emphasizes Reigart's thorniness, stubbornness and isolation. Even in the most ring-a-ding-ding moments of triumph, the actor refuses to let even the tiniest hint of grandiosity or sentimentality taint his performance. He is as tough  and comfortable as well-worn leather. 
''Behind Enemy Lines'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and scenes of violence.

‽
‽Spy Game‽,‽Many of Tony Scott's movies -- ''Top Gun,'' ''Crimson Tide,'' ''Enemy of the State,'' and now ''Spy Game'' -- are like gadgets in the Sharper Image catalog: sleek, expensive handsome gizmos of doubtful utility. Mr. Scott has an eye for sharp images and cool stuff, and his new movie has the pointless, thrilling kineticism of a sports car commercial. (Perhaps the director has not been recruited by BWM to make one of its high-concept Internet promo films because the project would be, in his case, redundant.) 
''Spy Game'' is seamlessly and crisply edited, a fast-moving collage of global architecture, top-secret documents and murky skulduggery with an accompanying soundtrack of world music and classic rock. Like a hot game of paint ball or a midsize sedan with sporty trim and a spoiler on the back, the movie provides a vehicle for macho romanticism, a fantasy of danger and derring-do for the deskbound. 
As such it provides its share of fun. Robert Redford, a cagey twinkle in his blue eyes, plays Nathan Muir, a maverick C.I.A. officer whose long, shadowy career is at its end: the movie tracks the hectic 24 hours before his retirement. ''I'm old school,'' Nathan says, applying hip-hop terminology to intelligence work. That he's not referring to the button-down, Ivy League agency of the early cold war era is evident in Nathan's appearance. His tweed sports coat, tortoise-shell glasses and shaggy blond hair mark him, amid the dark suits and rep ties of his snotty younger colleagues, as a man of the 70's, and it helps that he is embodied by one of that decade's leading male movie stars. 
Curiously, ''Spy Game'' is the second movie released this season in which Mr. Redford has seemed to revisit, and slyly revise, an earlier performance. His role in ''The Last Castle,'' Rod Lurie's chest-thumping prison melodrama, could not help but recall the beleaguered reform-minded warden he played in ''Brubaker.'' 
Nathan, with his laid-back sarcasm and his donnish fashion sense, recalls Joe Turner, the C.I.A. analyst Mr. Redford played in ''Three Days of the Condor'' in 1975. Turner was like a hip graduate student hemmed in by a malignant bureaucracy. Nathan is more like a weathered old rebel with tenure whose department is taken over by sharp-faced careerists like Harker (Stephen Dillane), a colleague who turns out to be Nathan's nemesis. 
Mr. Redford's easy white-bread  charm has always had an enigmatic dimension. (Who else could have played Jay Gatsby?) And here he plays a man whose relaxed familiarity conceals an absolute inscrutability. The sense that his character departs the movie in possession of secrets he hasn't told -- even the filmmakers may not be aware of what he knows -- nearly saves ''Spy Game'' from its dumb, overworked obviousness. 
Most of the picture takes place in 1991, when the C.I.A.'s main concern seems to be staying out of the way while a trade agreement is negotiated with China. Nathan speaks contemptuously of the agency's post-cold war mission -- ''it's about money,'' he sneers -- looking back fondly on the days when the C.I.A. stood for something loftier. 
What exactly that was is left purposely vague, but the long flashbacks that pad out the movie's running time and vary its visual texture paint a picture that is neither pretty nor coherent. As Nathan spends his last day on the job racing the clock and outwitting his superiors, we are led on a nostalgia tour of foreign policy hot spots, from Vietnam in 1975 to Berlin a few years later to Beirut in the mid-80's, when Nathan had served his ideals by assassinating politicians and hiring a Lebanese militia to drive a suicide truck bomb into a Beirut hotel. 
The point of these reminiscences is to explore the relationship between Nathan and Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), a hotheaded young idealist whom the older man recruited into the agency and who now awaits execution in a Chinese prison. The agency brass clearly wants to let him die, and Nathan, who in the past lived by a utilitarian code that allowed him to sacrifice other people's lives without compunction, decides to save him. 
In some ways ''Spy Game'' recalls another Redford picture from the 70's, ''The Way We Were,'' but with Mr. Pitt in the Barbra Streisand role. The initial affinity between Nathan and Tom -- with their period hair and aviator glasses they could be a Me Decade Dorian Gray and his walking portrait -- is strained by an ethical quarrel. Tom objects to his mentor's ruthless indifference to human life, which strikes the older man as evidence of fatal naïveté. They hash this out in various picturesque settings, including on a domed rooftop in Berlin, where someone has thoughtfully placed a table and chairs and where an airborne camera cyclones around them. 
All the geopolitics turns out of course to be window dressing for an absurd sentimentality, as Tom, midway through the Beirut operation, falls in love with an British foreign-aid worker (Catherine McCormack). The sufferings of the world don't amount to a hill of beans next to the lives of two good-looking people. This in itself is too familiar to be bothersome, but there is something obscene in the casual way Mr. Scott uses the images of maimed children in a Lebanese refugee camp, to say nothing of that truck bomb. 
The problem lies in the calculating pretentiousness of using human misery to make shallow entertainment seem serious. It's worth comparing ''Spy Game'' with ''The Tailor of Panama,'' John Boorman's far superior exercise in post-cold-war spycraft, which was sadly overlooked when it was released earlier this year. In treating the decline of old-school espionage satirically Mr. Boorman shed more light on the intersection of human ambitions and world politics than Mr. Scott, with his square-jawed bravura, can manage. 
''Spy Game'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some profanity, sexual situations and graphic violence.

‽
‽Black Knight‽,‽The funniest scene in the innocuous new Martin Lawrence comedy ''Black Knight'' reworks a surefire formula that has perked up dozens of otherwise routine comedies since the birth of rock 'n' roll: a pied piper of hip brings funky rhythm to the squares who spring to their feet, unable to resist the call of the wild. The messenger of the big beat in this case is a disgruntled theme park employee, Jamal Walker (Mr. Lawrence), who toils grumpily at Medieval World, a dilapidated outdoor fantasy kingdom rapidly heading for the junk heap. 
When Jamal accidentally tumbles into the park's filthy castle moat, he finds himself magically transported to England in the year 1328. After a series of silly mishaps he ends up court jester to the despotic King Leo (Kevin Conway). When commanded to demonstrate some Norman dances (Jamal has been passing himself off as a messenger from Normandy), he flounders around gawkily until an idea hits him. Approaching the court musicians, he prompts them into becoming an acoustic funk band. Before you know it, everyone is gyrating madly to a quasi-medieval arrangement (and quite contemporary-sounding version) of Sly and the Family Stone's ''Dance to the Music.'' 
The entire movie is itself a formula: another variation of ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' (with a nod to ''The Wizard of Oz''). This edition comes with hip-hop flavoring and a mild antiracist message. Jamal takes umbrage whenever he hears himself disdainfully referred to as ''the Moor.'' 
The star, who wears a football jersey through much of the movie, appears to be having a good time. But if Mr. Lawrence is an amiable enough screen presence, he is no comic wizard. The imperious, lethal parodies of Eddie Murphy or Jim Carrey are way beyond him. His energy is more roly-poly than slash and burn. Instead of snapping and crackling, it detonates in gentle pops. Mr. Lawrence belongs to the shambling-everyman, Adam Sandler school of cocky but klutzy dumb-like-a-fox bozos. If, when insulted, he is perfectly capable of giving as good as he gets, he doesn't seem to have a killer instinct. It's not necessary for him to slay an adversary; it's enough merely to stun him. 
''Black Knight'' has plot to burn. On arriving in England, Jamal's first encounter is with Knolte (Tom Wilkinson), an alcoholic knight whose life he saves with a timely administration of artificial respiration (an opportunity for some bad-breath jokes). Later in the movie Knolte is revealed to be a leader of a liberating army, which Jamal joins and in whose service he executes some mostly accidental heroics. 
His fiercest opponent both in the battle and for the attentions of Victoria, a beautiful chambermaid and rebel leader (Marsha Thomason), is snobbish, flinty-eyed Percival (Vincent Regan). When Percival tosses out the word ''Moor,'' it is delivered with the supercilious edge of a preppie brat. 
The sight gags that parody ''A Connecticut Yankee'' tend to fall flat. In one scene, as Jamal is about to be executed, he tries to save himself by claiming to be sorcerer who can conjure fire and pulls out a cigarette lighter. But we already have fire, comes the retort. The comic action sequences try for sharp farcical spoof but fall short. Pressured to ride a horse, Jamal finds himself dragged around by the animal but saves face by treating his ineptitude as a jester's entertainment. The sequence barely taps the situation's comic potential. The climactic battle sequences are chaotically goofy without being much fun. 
The film, directed by Gil Junger, has its predicable quota of off-color humor. Jamal is shocked, just shocked, by 14th-century sanitation and table manners. He lands in deep trouble when the king's sexually aggressive daughter sneaks into his bed and comports herself like a ''freak.'' 
''Black Knight'' is a movie that knows its audience. Its underlying philosophy might be: why try harder when this is all they expect? 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has gross-out humor, some strong language and sexual situations.

‽Out Cold‽,‽When the masters of the drive-in movie at American-International Pictures ran out of ideas for beach party films in the early 60's, they came up with ''Ski Party,'' a 1965 production that simply transferred the eternal themes of the beach genre -- revealing clothing, practical jokes and uncertainty over how far to go in sex and romance in the absence of adult supervision -- to the side of a mountain. 
That memorable creative choice now has its descendant in ''Out Cold,'' a ski party movie in which the clothes are a little more revealing than they were 35 years ago, the practical jokes are a little more tasteless, and the uncertainty over sex is pretty much nonexistent. Most crucial, instead of surfboards there are snowboards. 
But the character types remain the same. The population of Bull Mountain, a ragtag ski resort somewhere in Alaska (but filmed somewhere in Canada), consists of the handsome but heart-broken Rick (Jason London, a Brendan Fraser look-alike), his three goofy, substance-abusing pals (Zach Galifianakis, Flex Alexander and Derek Hamilton), the sweet blond girl with a crush on Rick (A. J. Cook), the exotic French girl whom Rick mistakenly prefers (Caroline Dhavernas), a pompous adult authority figure suitable for ritual humiliation (Lee Majors) and a free-ranging former Playmate of the Month (Victoria Silvstedt, Miss December of 1996). 
The plot, such as it is, kicks in when Mr. Majors's character, imaginatively named Mr. Majors, tries to take over Bull Mountain and transform it into Snownook, a prim and proper family resort with upscale coffee, a uniformed staff and countless other offenses to the ski bum sensibility. Such tyranny must not stand. 
''Out Cold'' was directed by yet another pair of filmmaking brothers, Brendan and Emmett Malloy, who seem to have carefully studied the work of their fraternal predecessors. From Bobby and Peter Farrelly, they have inherited the ski-slope slapstick and bathroom humor of ''Dumb and Dumber,'' and from Chris and Paul Weitz (''American Pie'') the Malloys have borrowed their characters' amusing tendency to have sex with inanimate objects (in this case, the air jets of a Jacuzzi). 
As in the old beach movies, a great deal of screen time is devoted to the astounding exploits of stunt doubles, who here are riding powdered snow rather than waves. The Malloys offer a few demonstrations of amazing grace and skill, but mostly the ski scenes consist of spectacular wipe-outs as obviously painful as they are obviously real. Ouch. 
''Out Cold'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for its strong language, crude humor and scenes of drug and alcohol use.

‽
‽Sidewalks of New York‽,‽Surely, after everything this city has been through, the time is right for a breezy, captivating New York romantic comedy. ''Sidewalks of New York'' is not an especially good movie, but it will do. Edward Burns, who wrote, directed and stars, has an evident and specific fondness for Manhattan: the slightly insecure romanticism of a migrant from the outer boroughs or the near suburbs. This sentiment is most clearly expressed by Mr. Burns's character, a television producer named Tommy, who comes from Queens. 
His real estate agent Annie (Heather Graham), a native Upper East Sider, says his origin makes him something less than a real New Yorker. Tommy's response to her unthinking snobbery is to recite his family history: grandfathers who toiled as sandhogs and construction workers, a police officer father and a mother who is a nurse. The speech is perhaps a little contrived, but it is touching and genuine and captures what is best about the movie. 
As an actor, Mr. Burns has an easy charm tinged with an aggression that seems rooted in class resentment. In his eagerness to show that he's a nice guy, he suggests that his niceness has limits. Annie, miserably married to Griffin (Stanley Tucci), a philandering dentist, is not Tommy's only love interest. For much of the movie he conducts a hesitant romance with Maria (Rosario Dawson), a divorced schoolteacher. The movie's most understated scene is a confrontation in the hallway outside Maria's apartment between Tommy and Ben, her ex-husband, a boyish doorman who cuts an unimposing figure in his tan uniform and green hooded parka. Even though Ben longs to reunite with Maria, to whom he was unfaithful, he is increasingly smitten with Ashley (Brittany Murphy), a waitress having an affair with that same dentist. 
''Sidewalks'' bobs and weaves through this geometry of interlocking triangles, punctuating dates and arguments with mock interviews, in which the characters face the camera and muse on the complexities of love, sex and fidelity. 
Tommy and Maria meet in a video store, where they both want to rent the same movie. Later, we find out it was ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' but in preparing for his fourth venture in filmmaking Mr. Burns seems to have run up enormous late fees on Woody Allen's ''Husbands and Wives.'' He has appropriated not only that film's narrative structure but also its visual technique, sending his hand-held camera hurtling down one apartment hallway after another. For some reason -- too much coffee, perhaps, or too many episodes of ''Homicide'' -- he peppers his scenes with jump cuts. To complement this visual stuttering, the dialogue is full of pauses, repetitions and bursts of profanity. These stylistic noodlings are no doubt meant to mimic the syncopated rhythms of urban life and speech, but instead they expose the weakness of the story and script. 
''Sidewalks of New York'' is like a Woody Allen movie without the intellectual pretension, which is mostly a good thing. But Mr. Burns is a little too comfortable with the limits of his imagination and strangely uninterested in his own characters. The six move through their rondelay without credible motive, their various attractions assumed rather than explained. Their behavior toward one another seems almost random, obeying no emotional logic. 
Griffin is so evidently a narcissistic lout, bad in bed and unpleasant to be with, that it's hard to understand what either Annie or Ashley are doing with him. The other characters, while much more likable, are so thinly drawn that it's hard, a few minutes after leaving the theater, to recall anything they did or said. 
Though it fails to be very interesting, ''Sidewalks of New York,'' like the people who populate Mr. Burns's New York, is impossible to dislike. If it's not especially funny, it is appealingly good-humored, and the actors perform well within the limitations of the script. (Dennis Farina provides some comic relief as Tommy's boss, a leathery lothario who drinks martinis in his bubble bath and gives his protégé advice that sounds as if it were cribbed from the latest issue of Maxim.) 
Mr. Burns also deserves credit for avoiding the sudsy happily-ever-after clichés that deform so many contemporary romantic comedies. The view of love that emerges from ''Sidewalks,'' while it is not particularly deep or insightful, is refreshingly hard-headed without being altogether cynical. 
''Sidewalks of New York'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanities.

‽Shottas‽,‽Stars from reggae and other musical worlds give acting a try in “Shottas,” and it appears that most of them might actually be good at it. But they are trapped in such a witless, misogynistic, gratuitously violent, drug-culture-worshiping film that it’s impossible to say for certain. 
The featured attraction is Ky-Mani  Marley, a son of Bob, who has done some reggae recording but here tries out the role of a drug kingpin named Biggs. Spragga Benz, a dancehall star, plays Biggs’s childhood friend Wayne, and they get an early start on a life of crime, robbing a deliveryman to get money to flee Jamaica for Miami. 
We next see Biggs grown and back in Jamaica; he has logged time inside an American prison and then been deported. He and Wayne reunite and, with some pals, kill an assortment of Jamaicans, then return to Miami to try to kill their way back into drug-lordship there. 
“Shottas” (a Jamaican equivalent of gangster) is full of interesting performers in the smaller roles; the best known is probably Wyclef Jean, who also composed the movie’s music. But Cess Silvera, the film’s writer and director, doesn’t find any of the humanity or inner demons that would allow the characters to rise above B-movie exploitation. And even though almost everyone is dead by the end, make no mistake: This movie glorifies the drug trade and the contempt for life that it entails. Somehow these despicable thugs are surrounded by curvaceous, compliant women, who tend to be onscreen just long enough to bare their breasts, which promptly get bullet holes in them. 
“Shottas” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence, nudity, language and drug themes.

‽
‽Hell's Highway‽,‽The best way to see ''Hell's Highway,'' which opens today in Manhattan, might be on a double bill with ''2 Fast 2 Furious.'' Yes, one is a scholarly documentary and the other a dunderheaded action picture, but both, in their different ways, offer testimony to the love affair between the movie camera and the automobile. ''2 Fast'' celebrates the thrills of recklessness and speed, while ''Hell's Highway'' examines their grisly consequences. 
Or, rather, it examines the ways these have been examined, since the movie itself is not an exercise in cautionary driver's-ed cinema, but rather an exploration of that genre's golden age and greatest auteurs. You will not find their names in the film history textbooks, but the folks who worked for Highway Safety Films (later the Highway Safety Foundation) from the late 1950's to the mid-70's deserve at least a footnote, which Bret Wood, who put together this mélange of talking-head interviews and archival clips, is happy to provide. 
Highway Safety Films combined educational high-mindedness with an evident but unacknowledged ghoulishness. It was started by Richard Wayman, an Ohio accountant whose hobby was taking pictures of fatal car accidents. He soon gathered around him a group of like-minded citizens, including a police officer and a few insurance executives, who hit upon the idea of showing these shocking images to high school students to acquaint them with the horrible consequences of unsafe driving. They were, quite literally, ambulance chasers, but with a strong sense of civic mission. The ones who are still around to be interviewed are gray on top and thick around the middle, and they exude a plain-spoken, Midwestern practicality that makes their enterprise seem all the more bizarre. 
On hand to interpret it are a video distributor, who markets the movies as cult artifacts, and a professorial type who interprets them as ideological texts. The films themselves, with titles like ''Mechanized Death,'' ''Wheels of Tragedy'' and ''The Last Prom,'' may be technically crude, but their impact is undeniable. Real-life shots of smashed faces and twisted bodies, accompanied by a soundtrack of whimpers and moans, alternate with re-enactments, in which, canonically, the girl in the passenger seat begs her date to slow down, until finally her pleas become a scream of terror and the screen goes black to the sound of a shattering windshield. 
Some time is spent pondering the pedagogical effectiveness of such images, and more is spent poking into some odd corners of the Highway Safety story. A number of unsavory rumors attached themselves to the company: that it had a sideline in pornography, that one of the founders had been murdered, that it was tied to organized crime. But on the evidence of ''Hell's Highway,'' these seem to be urban legends. Still, the company did make a film, apparently intended to train police officers in video surveillance, that showed men having sex in public restrooms. It also distributed a movie called ''The Child Molester,'' which is so creepy and disturbing that you can hardly believe it was shown to first graders. (It was, and two of them, now grown up, appear on camera to testify to its traumatizing effects.) 
Since scaring children has gone out of fashion as a teaching tool, it seems only natural that these movies take on a queasy, nostalgic fascination. But the movie is agnostic about how much progress we have made. Nowadays, car safety films feature crash test dummies rather than bloody corpses, and automobile manufacturers are assigned a much greater responsibility for the well-being of their customers. Someday, perhaps, someone will make a documentary of Volvo commercials and Consumers Union test-drive videos, but I doubt it will be as unnerving -- or as much fun -- as ''Hell's Highway.'' 
''Hell's Highway: The True Story of Highway Safety Films'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), even though the films were originally intended to be shown to high school students. It has graphic images of mangled car-accident victims.

‽
‽Pinocchio‽,‽Miramax seems to be showing the same faith in Roberto Benigni's ''Pinocchio'' that the Republican Party showed in Trent Lott; the live-action version of Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the wooden puppet whose only ambition was to be a real live boy was sneaked into theaters Christmas Day. A recent -- very recent -- decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. 
That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over. There must have been such a rush to get the prints into theaters for the nationwide opening that no one bothered to check the lip-syncing. It's as if someone tried to hit a target with a can of paint. 
In this enchanted setting, ''a land where grown-ups can act like children,'' a magic log falls off a cart and disrupts an entire tiny town. It bounces into Geppetto's home-workshop, and he quickly says, ''You can be like the son I never had'' as he carves into it his idea of a little boy. I guess Geppetto doesn't get out much, because his idea of a child is a 40-ish man with a receding hairline, pancake makeup and 5 o'clock shadow: the Pinocchio he fashions is Mr. Benigni. (It's particularly galling as Pinocchio makes fun of Geppetto's blond hairpiece, which looks like the thatched roof of a hut.) ''You're made out of pine; I'll call you Pinocchio,'' Geppetto says, struggling to get a word in over Pinocchio's constant bleating. 
This movie is also a chunk of pine, but it's still awaiting the magic touch to transmute it into a real live movie. ''Pinocchio'' opens with the Blue Fairy (played by Nicoletta Braschi, voiced by Glenn Close) coming into a small town, riding a carriage pulled by a train of little white mice: an undulating river of full-moon-colored fur towing her along. It's one of the few splashes of wonderment -- courtesy of the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, and the production designer-magician, Danilo Donati -- in a picture that is mostly a desert of strangeness, a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes ''Battleship Earth'' and ''Showgirls.'' The heavy sighs of the few other people in the theater, who apparently had been paroled into the custody of the multiplex, were easily heard over the long, dead silences between Pinocchio-Benigni's chattering. 
Geppetto encourages Pinocchio to go to school, but he's not interested. When he is visited by a talking insect named Cricket (voice of John Cleese), who must have danced over from the magical land of copyright infringement, Pinocchio blathers, ''One job I want: the job of eating, drinking and playing.'' 
Cricket scolds Pinocchio so often with ''Serves you right'' over his misbehaving that the little creature begins to sound like a rehab counselor. The Blue Fairy keeps an eye on Pinocchio, listening to his promises to be good. He always lets her down, and she keeps coming back; the subtitle should be ''When Good Fairies Love Bad Puppets.'' 
Geppetto is a sucker for Pinocchio's word much longer than he should be, too, though their relationship is more obviously informed by delusion. It's hard to tell what's sadder, Geppetto's belief that Pinocchio is a child puppet or Mr. Benigni's need to play one. When he affectionately smooches Geppetto's face, it's like Jack playing out one of his outré fantasies on ''Will and Grace.'' 
Other scenes of unintentional innuendo can be found. While Pinocchio is pulling one of his many jail stretches for a crime he didn't commit -- he spends more time in manacles that Enron's senior executives -- one of his cellmates, another adult under the illusion that he's a boy, offers a lick of a lollipop that's ''the flavor of paradise.'' How did this movie get past the Motion Picture Association? 
Mr. Benigni's decision makes this ''Pinocchio'' as believable as Diana Ross playing Dorothy in ''The Wiz'' or Matthew McConaughey portraying a college graduate in ''Contact.'' The movie does follow Collodi's sweeping ebb and flow closely. 
Occasionally the inflation works well. The whale that swallows Pinocchio and Geppetto whole is now a great white shark. And when Pinocchio is swindled into joining a pack of party boys and is turned into a donkey, the scene in which he becomes a circus beast of burden borders on touching. That is, it would if there had been an actress other than Ms. Braschi, with her Mona Lisa inexpressiveness, watching the affair. (With her blue-gelatin hair, she looks like an older version of post-punker Siouxsie, from the Banshees.) 
It's an oddity that will be avoided by millions of people, this new ''Pinocchio.'' Osama bin Laden could attend a showing in Times Square and be confident of remaining hidden.

‽
‽Catch Me If You Can‽,‽Here in the land of opportunity, we pride ourselves on taking one another at face value. That's why in a culture that falls all over itself to invest glamorous images with substance, any quick-witted trickster can have a field day pretending to be what he's not. 
In the opening scene of ''Catch Me if You Can,'' Steven Spielberg's supremely entertaining portrait of a virtuoso impostor, its protagonist, Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), appears on ''To Tell the Truth,'' the archetypal television game show celebrating mendacity and fraud. Before his 19th birthday, the announcer proclaims, Frank successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and made millions of dollars forging checks. 
As the camera surveys the three contestants, there's Mr. DiCaprio in the middle, the faintest twinkle of mischief in his snaky eyes, his baby face gone playfully poker. Mr. DiCaprio's portrayal of this brilliant fraud is, in a word, sensational (and far more confident, by the way, than his stolid star turn in ''Gangs of New York''). An extraordinarily fluid and instinctive actor, Mr. DiCaprio has always conveyed the slippery acuity of a chameleon whiz kid who could talk his way in and out of any situation, and his performance is a glorious exhibition of artful, intuitive slipping, sliding and wriggling. 
In ''Catch Me if You Can,'' the 28-year-old actor melts into the body and mind of a wily, precocious teenager who turns himself into a master forger. Adding depth to his performance is the flashing intensity with which he conveys Frank's mercurial bouts of insecurity and panic. Even while his character is flying high, Mr. DiCaprio understands that Frank is a wounded boy, and the actor remains in intimate touch with the childish desperation behind his bravado. 
Initially at least, Frank's goal isn't a selfish urge to find a shortcut to the high life, but to recoup the standard of living lost by his larcenous father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), who is being hounded by the I.R.S. for tax fraud. The son also vaguely imagines that with enough money he can reunite his parents, who split up early in the movie. In the most poignant scene, a lawyer announces to the stunned youth that his parents are divorcing, and in the next breath insists he choose between them. Frank refuses and runs away from home to begin his career of kiting checks. 
A major strand of the film is a father-son love story, in which Frank hungrily absorbs his shady dad's lessons in deception, bribery and sweet talk. The chemistry between Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Walken (giving one of his strongest, most sympathetic screen performances) is so charged the two actors actually seem to share the same reptilian genes. 
''Catch Me if You Can'' moves in pirouetting leaps and dips that mirror its peripatetic antihero's shifting identities and changes of fortune. The game-show excerpt, which follows a cool-handed animated title sequence, sets the lighthearted tone of a movie that admires Frank almost to the point of suspending moral judgment. 
From here, the film hops over to France in 1969 to observe Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the strait-laced F.B.I. agent who has pursued Frank with a Javert-like persistence, confront him with the roster of criminal charges in a grim Marseille prison. Then it bounces back to 1963 in New Rochelle where the fresh-faced 15-year-old Frank and his French mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), are attending a cozy Rotary Club ceremony honoring Frank Sr., whose fortunes are about to take a dive. 
The film eventually makes stops in Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta and New Orleans. Some of the wittiest scenes find Frank engaged to an adoring airheaded nurse, Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), whom he meets during his brief career impersonating a doctor. He so charms her unctuous father, Roger (Martin Sheen), a New Orleans prosecutor, into imagining they're fellow romantics that Roger helps him establish a new identity as an assistant prosecutor. Frank's television textbook for courtroom decorum is ''Perry Mason.'' 
To describe ''Catch Me if You Can'' (which takes its title from the autobiography of the real Frank Abagnale) as a smart, funny caper film is to ignore its strain of sly social satire. If the spine of the story is the elaborate cat-and-mouse game of Frank and Carl, the movie, written by Jeff Nathanson, is also a delicately barbed reflection on the American character and the giddy 60's ethos that allowed Frank to live out his fantasies. The 60's, you may recall, were the decade when jobs became ''gigs.'' And John Williams's uncharacteristically jaunty, saxophone-flavored score captures that spirit of frisky devil-may-care merriment. 
The film's cheeky attitude is distilled in a fable Frank Sr. passes down to his son about two mice who fall into a vat of cream. One mouse instantly drowns, while the other puts up such a furious struggle that the cream turns into butter and the mouse walks out. That story is repeated three times in the movie, the third time as a ludicrous mealtime blessing Frank delivers at the Strongs' dinner table. 
Without referring to the burgeoning hippie culture or to the era's radical politics, drugs and rock 'n' roll, ''Catch Me if You Can'' captures the frivolous side of the 60's: the decade of ''The Pink Panther'' movies, ''The Girl From Ipanema,'' the Rat Pack and James Bond. A clip of Sean Connery and Honor Blackman swapping double-entendres in ''Goldfinger'' introduces a delicious scene, set to the silky purr of Dusty Springfield's ''Look of Love,'' in which Frank, impersonating a junior-size Bond wannabe, outwits a high-priced call girl. 
Among Frank's assumed identities, the one he savors the most is airline pilot. And the movie's zaniest scenes remind us of those tinselly days when air travel was sold as sex in the sky. Before the arrival of the metal detector lent aviation an ominous undertone, every airline passenger was a jet setter, uniformed pilots rivaled astronauts in masculine sex appeal, and a lubricious novelty like ''Coffee, Tea or Me? The Uninhibited Memoirs of Two Airline Stewardesses'' could be a best seller. 
The movie's recurrent images of squealing, strutting flight attendants batting their eyes at the pilots are a hilarious throwback to a swinging 60's just before a resurgent feminism rewrote the rules of courtship and airline employment, and turned stewardesses from jiggly, compliant bunnies into crisply efficient flight attendants. 
Arguably the best-acted of any Spielberg film, ''Catch Me if You Can'' finds Mr. Hanks displaying his usual aplomb. The actor hones a severe, potentially drab role into an incisive, touching character study of a lonely, humorless New England workaholic whose adrenaline is fired by a cat-and-mouse game in which he loses all the early rounds. Over time, Carl develops a respect and a paternal fondness for Frank. And in the movie's finale, the father-son theme culminates in Frank having to choose between the values of his real father and the surrogate dad who reined him in. 
''Catch Me'' is the most charming of Mr. Spielberg's mature films, because is it so relaxed. Instead of trying to conjure fairy-tale magic, wring tears or insinuate a message, it is happy just to be its delicious, genially sophisticated self. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some strong language and mild sexual situations.

‽
‽Gangs of New York‽,‽GANGS OF NEW YORK,'' Martin Scorsese's brutal, flawed and indelible epic of 19th-century urban criminality, begins in a mud-walled, torchlighted cavern, where a group of warriors prepare for battle, arming themselves with clubs and blades and armoring themselves in motley leather and cloth. Though this is Lower Manhattan in 1846, it might as well be the Middle Ages or the time of Gilgamesh: these warlike rituals have an archaic, archetypal feeling. 
And the participants are aware of this. As the members of various colorfully named Irish gangs emerge into the winter daylight of Paradise Square (a place long since given over to high-rises and resurrected here on the grounds of the vast Cinecittà studio complex in Rome), their native-born Protestant enemies greet them with an invocation of ''the ancient laws of combat.'' The ensuing melee turns the new-fallen snow pink with blood and claims the life of Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), an Irish gang chieftain whose young son witnesses the carnage. 
Sixteen years later, the boy, whose name is Amsterdam, has grown into Leonardo DiCaprio, his wide, implacable face framed by lank hair and a wispy Van Dyke. He returns from a long stint in the Hell Gate Reformatory to his old neighborhood, the Five Points, and finds it ruled by his father's killer, Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), known as the Butcher, a swaggering monster who has turned the anniversary of Priest's death into a local holiday. 
Like a figure out of Jacobean theater or a Dumas novel, Amsterdam is consumed by the need for revenge. With the help of a boyhood friend (Henry Thomas), he infiltrates the Butcher's inner circle, becoming a surrogate son to the man who assassinated his father and who now, in accordance with those ancient laws, venerates Priest's memory. 
The New York evoked in Amsterdam's voice-over is ''a city full of tribes and war chiefs,'' whose streets are far meaner than any Mr. Scorsese has contemplated before. The Butcher has formed an alliance of convenience with Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent), the kingpin of Tammany Hall, and together they administer an empire of graft, extortion and larceny that would put any 20th-century movie gangster or political boss to shame. Rival fire companies turn burning buildings into sites of rioting and plunder; crowds gather to witness hangings, bare-knuckled boxing contests and displays of knife throwing. 
As new immigrants, from Ireland and elsewhere, pour off the ships in New York harbor, they are mustered into Tweed's Democratic Party and then, since they lack the $300 necessary to buy their way out, into the Union Army. Occasionally a detachment of reform-minded swells will tour the Points, availing themselves of the perennial privileges of squeamish titillation and easy moral superiority. This anarchic inferno is, in Amsterdam's words, not so much a city as ''a cauldron in which a great city might be forged.'' 
And in recreating it, Mr. Scorsese has made a near-great movie. His interest in violence, both random and organized, is matched by his love of street-level spectacle. His Old New York is a gaudy multiethnic carnival of misrule, music and impromptu theater, a Breughel painting come to life. Though the details of this lawless, teeming, vibrant milieu may be unfamiliar, we nonetheless instinctively recognize it, from the 19th-century novels of Dickens and Zola, from samurai movies and American westerns and from some of this director's previous films. 
Most notably in ''Mean Streets, ''Goodfellas,'' ''The Age of Innocence'' and ''Casino,'' Mr. Scorsese has functioned as a kind of romantic visual anthropologist, fascinated by tribal lore and language, by half-acknowledged codes of honor and retribution and by the boundaries between loyalty and vengeance, between courtesy and violence, that underlie a given social order. 
As in ''Casino'' and ''The Age of Innocence,'' the setting of ''Gangs'' is sometimes more interesting than the story. At 2 hours 45 minutes, the film, deftly edited by Mr. Scorsese's frequent collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, moves swiftly and elegantly. It is never dull, but I must confess that I wish it were longer, so that the lives of the protagonists, rather than standing out in relief against a historical background, were more fully embedded within it. The quasi-Oedipal struggle between Amsterdam and Bill is meant to have a mythic resonance, but that makes it the most conventional element in the picture. 
The relationship between the two men is triangulated by Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a flame-haired thief (and a protégée of Bill's) who catches Amsterdam's eye and steals his lucky religious medallion. But like Sharon Stone in ''Casino,'' Ms. Diaz ends up with no outlet for her spitfire energies, since her character is more a structural necessity -- the linchpin of male jealousy -- than a fully imagined person. The limitations of her role point to a more serious lapse, which is the movie's lack of curiosity about what women's lives might have been like in Old New York. 
Like Tony Soprano's crew in the V.I.P. room at the Bada Bing, Bill and his minions spend a lot of time cavorting with half-naked prostitutes, which is fair (and for all I know accurate) enough. But all the glum evocation of lost fathers makes you wonder if any of these guys had mothers, and you wonder what a typical household in the Five Points might have looked like. (Though I, like just about everyone else, had been waiting impatiently for ''Gangs,'' I almost wish Mr. Scorsese and his screenwriters had been delayed long enough to take account of ''Paradise Alley,'' Kevin Baker's new novel about the draft riots of 1863, in which some of the events touched on in this movie are perceived through women's eyes.) 
These objections should not detract from an appreciation of what Mr. Scorsese and his cast have done. Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz may be too pretty for the neighborhood, but one should hardly hold their being movie stars against them; they are smart, eager and intrepid actors as well. For his part Mr. Day-Lewis positively luxuriates in his character's villainy and turns Bill's flavorsome dialogue into vernacular poetry. 
He understands the Shakespearean dimensions of the character and has enough art to fill them out. Surrounded by Irish brogues and deracinated British accents, Mr. Day-Lewis has the wit to speak an early version of Noo Yawkese, making the Butcher the butt of a marvelous historical joke: this bigoted, all-but-forgotten nativist, it turns out, bequeathed his speech patterns to the children of the immigrants he despised. 
''Gangs of New York'' is an important film as well as an entertaining one. With this project, Mr. Scorsese has made his passionate ethnographic sensibility the vehicle of an especially grand ambition. He wants not only to reconstruct the details of life in a distant era but to construct, from the ground up, a narrative of historical change, to explain how we -- New Yorkers, Americans, modern folk who disdain hand-to-hand bloodletting and overt displays of corruption -- got from there to here, how the ancient laws gave way to modern ones. 
Such an ambition is rare in American movies, and rarer still is the sense of tragedy and contradiction that Mr. Scorsese brings to his saga. There is very little in the history of American cinema to prepare us for the version of American history Mr. Scorsese presents here. It is not the usual triumphalist story of moral progress and enlightenment, but rather a blood-soaked revenger's tale, in which the modern world arrives in the form of a line of soldiers firing into a crowd. 
The director's great accomplishment, the result of three decades of mulling and research inspired by Herbert Asbury's ''Gangs of New York'' -- a 1928 book nearly as legendary as the world it illuminates -- has been to bring to life not only the texture of the past but its force and velocity as well. For all its meticulously imagined costumes and sets (for which the production designer, Dante Ferretti, surely deserves an Oscar), this is no costume drama. 
It is informed not by the polite antiquarianism of Merchant and Ivory but by the political ardor of someone like Luchino Visconti, one of Mr. Scorsese's heroes. ''Senso,'' Visconti's lavish 1953 melodrama set during the Italian Risorgimento (and his first color film), is one of the touchstones of ''My Voyage to Italy,'' Mr. Scorsese's fascinating, quasi-autobiographical documentary on postwar Italian cinema. 
Though ''Gangs of New York'' throws in its lot with the rabble rather than the aristocracy, it shares with ''Senso'' (and also with ''The Leopard,'' Visconti's 1965 masterpiece) a feeling that the past, so full of ambiguity and complexity, of barbarism and nobility, continues to send its aftershocks into the present. It shows us a world on the brink of vanishing and manages to mourn that world without doubting the inevitability or the justice of its fate. 
''America was born in the streets,'' the posters for ''Gangs'' proclaim. Later, Amsterdam Vallon, in the aftermath of the draft riots, muses that ''our great city was born in blood and tribulation.'' Nobody as steeped in film history as Mr. Scorsese could offer such a metaphor without conjuring the memory of D. W. Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation,'' and Griffith, along with John Ford and others, is one of the targets of Mr. Scorsese's revisionism. 
In Griffith's film, adapted from ''The Clansman,'' a best-selling novel by Thomas Dixon, the American republic was reborn after Reconstruction, when the native-born whites of the North and South overcame their sectional differences in the name of racial supremacy. Ford's myth of American origins -- which involved the subjugation of the frontier and the equivocal replacement of antique honor by modern justice -- also typically took place after the Civil War. 
In ''Gangs,'' which opens nationwide today, the pivotal event in our history is the riot that convulsed New York in July of 1863. While this emphasis places the immigrant urban working class at the center of the American story -- a fairly radical notion in itself -- the film hardly sentimentalizes the insurrection, which was both a revolt against local and federal authority and a vicious massacre of the black citizens of New York. 
The rioters are seen as exploited, oppressed and destined to be cannon fodder in a war they barely understand, but they are far from heroic, and the violence of the riots makes the film's opening gang battle seem quaint and decorous. What we are witnessing is the eclipse of warlordism and the catastrophic birth of a modern society. Like the old order, the new one is riven by class resentment, racism and political hypocrisy, attributes that change their form at every stage of history but that seem to be as embedded in human nature as the capacity for decency, solidarity and courage. 
This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology, either liberal or conservative. Mr. Scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated. 
This movie was a long time in the making, but its life has barely begun. Now that the industry gossip about it has subsided, let us hope that a more substantial discussion can start. People who care about American history, professionally and otherwise, will no doubt weigh in on the accuracy of its particulars and the validity of its interpretation; they will also, I hope, revisit some of their own suppositions in light of its unsparing and uncompromised imagining of the past. I said earlier that ''Gangs of New York'' is nearly a great movie. I suspect that, over time, it will make up the distance. 
''Gangs of New York'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The pervasiveness of its violence makes you realize how much New York has changed in a century and a half. On the other hand, the nudity, profanity and sexual references may lead you to think that it has barely changed at all.

‽
‽Two Weeks Notice‽,‽Breezing along on gusts of stale air and perky inanities, ''Two Weeks Notice'' is a romantic comedy so vague and sadly undernourished that it makes one of Nora Ephron's low-cal strawberry sodas seem as tempting as a Philip Barry feast. As George Wade (Hugh Grant), a rich, piggy New York real estate developer, and Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock), the Brooklyn-based environmental lawyer he hires as his chief counsel, spar and parry, you are supposed to think Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. 
How long will it be before the yammering, brainy lawyer shuts up and succumbs to her boss's rakish charms? And once he realizes her true worth (she boasts that she makes love like ''a bobcat pretzel,'' whatever that is), how long before her kisses instill him with a teeny-weeny blip of social conscience? After you've endured a half-hour of the movie's toothless sitcom dialogue, the answer is the sooner the better. 
''Two Weeks Notice'' -- the first feature directed by Marc Lawrence, a writer of the beauty pageant spoof ''Miss Congeniality,'' a far wittier film that also starred Ms. Bullock -- is so desperate for laughs that it ends up looking for them in the bathroom. Even then it comes up short. Its most ambitious joke is to give Lucy a sudden attack of diarrhea in the middle of a traffic jam while she and George are driving back to Manhattan from a Mets game at which she consumed too much junk food. 
Her chivalrous boss insists they abandon the car then and there, and he bribes the driver of the nearest trailer to let Lucy use the toilet. While she groans and retches in the background, George gallantly makes small talk with the Kentucky rednecks who have taken them in. 
But what's one abandoned car, anyway, to a man as rich as George? When they reach a shopping center, he has his company helicopter fly in to whisk the couple back to Manhattan. In a movie that worships wealth while pretending to have a social conscience, that scenic ride is the swooning equivalent of a trip to the Moon. 
''Two Weeks Notice,'' which opens today nationwide, seems to be more about star casting than about love, politics, business or anything else. And at least on paper the pairing of Mr. Grant and Ms. Bullock (who produced the movie) makes sense. He specializes in stammering Prince Charmings who, with a flick of their scepters, confer a swanlike grace on the avaricious, not-so-ugly ducklings swarming around them, tin cups in hand. She specializes in feisty independent tomboys in flight from their inner princesses, whose pesky, demanding hormones lead them back to true love despite their principles. Had these two clicked on the screen, they might have emerged as Hollywood's new odd couple: Prince Charming and his radiant made-over Minnie Mouse. 
But ambling through their screwball paces, the stars exhibit so little personal chemistry that they seem barely aware of each other. When, late in the movie, Lucy gets dolled up for a fancy bash, and George really notices her for the first time, his look of love is so unconvincing it confers no sparkle. As the camera admires Ms. Bullock through his eyes, Minnie Mouse looks more like Michael Jackson in drag than Cinderella. 
''Two Weeks Notice'' might not seem quite so fatuous had it not appeared years after ''Sex and the City'' raised the bar on urban romantic comedy and sharpened pop cultural discussions of sex, money and social mobility. Although the genre still allows mice to turn into princesses and frogs into princes, nowadays those transformations require some credible explanation. 
But Mr. Grant's George, an American with a British accent and apparently a testosterone deficiency, exudes barely a trace of the wheeler-dealer chutzpah his real estate career would demand. The movie's suggestion that this hard-boiled softy is a suave lothario who would hire bimbo lawyers with dubious academic credentials just to sleep with them is ludicrous. 
Ms. Bullock's Lucy is only marginally more believable. Despite her Harvard Law School background, this character, who must be pushing 40, still lives near her parents in Coney Island. When she's home alone at night, she orders three times as much Chinese takeout as she can consume. Isn't that cute? 
For these predestined sweethearts to connect, of course, George must eventually change his ways. All it takes to turn this moral monster into Mother Teresa is for him to agree not to raze a community center in Lucy's neighborhood. That decision entails a painful sacrifice. From now on George will have to share the company helicopter. Talk about cut-rate redemption, Hollywood style. 
''Two Weeks Notice'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some strong language and mild sexual situations.

‽The Wild Thornberrys Movie‽,‽A blend of ''Dr. Dolittle'' and ''Family Ties,'' the animated series ''The Wild Thornberrys'' has been a staple of the Nickleodeon children's cable network since 1998. Never shy about exploiting its brand names, Nickelodeon has now turned the program into a feature film, carrying over most of the creative personnel of the series. 
On screen, ''The Wild Thornberrys'' looks just as it does on television, only wider. The directors, Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian, use a Cinemascope-like frame to create a cartoon Africa with a greater sweep than its television counterpart, though the visuals inevitably fall short of their obvious model, Disney's ''Lion King.'' Without the financial or creative resources of the Disney animators, ''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' remains essentially an extended Saturday morning cartoon -- which is to say, a series of hastily executed illustrations matched to a voice track. 
The Thornberrys are an Anglo-American family of five. Dad Nigel is a blustery upper-class Englishman (entertainingly voiced by Tim Curry with the rolling vowels of C. Aubrey Smith) who with his plucky American wife, Marianne (Jodi Carlisle), makes nature documentaries for public television. They have two daughters, 12-year-old Eliza (Lacey Chabert), a shy girl with glasses, braces and spots on her face that could be either freckles or acne, and Debbie (Danielle Harris), a hormonally charged teenager who pines for American shopping malls. Their little brother, Donnie (played in grunts and squeals by the rock star Flea), is a still-unsocialized wild child, discovered and adopted by the Thornberrys during one of their expeditions. 
The series hangs on Eliza's magical ability to talk to the animals, granted to her by an African shaman on the condition that her special skills must always remain a secret. This allows her to communicate with her favorite pet, a chimpanzee named Darwin (Tom Kane), whose posh British accent and relentless snobbishness suggest that he, too, has spent some time on the playing fields of Eton. 
Eliza and Darwin set out to rescue a cheetah cub who has been snatched from the veldt by a pair of high-tech poachers (Rupert Everett and Marisa Tomei). They do, though it takes them a little longer than it would on television, involving as it does the need to escape from an oppressive British boarding school (where the headmistress has the voice of Brenda Blethyn) and beat it back to the cartoon Congo. 
The film, which opens nationally today, is bland but harmless. 
''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the action scenes may be too suspenseful for tiny viewers.

‽The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers‽,‽The director Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion for the second of the film adaptations, ''The Two Towers.'' It may be the first sequel that does not bother to reprise the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is to simply drop us right into the action. 
Even for those deeply immersed in the material, this stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension -- the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey; this mission began in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, begins the end of life in Middle Earth, as was indicated in the first ''Ring'' movie, ''The Fellowship of the Ring.'' 
Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source. Mr. Jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence, creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material. Mr. Jackson's ploy in this beautifully considered epic is to give viewers the same feeling of confusion that his characters are experiencing. By doing this he simultaneously answers those who complained that too much of the previous ''Rings'' was about setup. 
A brief recap of a climactic battle between the friendly wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a fire demon -- one of many climactic battles from ''Fellowship'' -- is shown near the start. But this scene is used to set ''The Two Towers'' in motion. It is a daring gambit to have viewers enter a movie bearing such complex preceding action with so little information. Even though the first film took in enough cash to jump-start the flagging United States economy single-handedly, Mr. Jackson does not seem to understand that there are people who haven't absorbed the ''Rings'' chronology into the entirety of their beings. And there may even be folks out there who haven't seen ''Fellowship,'' but will be lured into theaters for ''Towers'' by all the attention that ''Fellowship'' attracted. Such moviegoers may feel left out, puzzled and unable to keep up. 
With the narrative of ''Rings,'' Tolkien was investigating determination, loyalty and, finally, faith, finding innumerable ways to offer up the concept of purity of heart, as found in Matthew 5:8 and in Kierkegaard, whose contention was that purity of heart was the ability to will one thing into being. The pursuit of purity is at the center of ''Towers.'' 
For our hero, Frodo, whose quest is to purge the forces of menacing evil from Middle Earth, purity is demonstrated by combating the temptation to wear the ring and be consumed by its corrupting power. He gets a taste of what the future might be like when he and Sam meet Gollum, a hobbit who was once seduced by the ring. He is now an emotional and physical shambles; emaciated and slunk into a perpetual crouch, Gollum's translucent, waxy skin is a membrane that just barely contains his insides. 
Gollum is divided within himself; he is an infantilized wreck who wants to please and befriend the hobbits. But he is also a hissing, bitter child-man whose paranoia keeps him breathing, and plotting. Gollum is a computer-generated creation and as fully realized a character as can be found in ''Towers'' -- perhaps the most fully realized. (He has been dropped into the movie more effectively than George Lucas crammed Jar Jar Binks into his recent ''Star Wars'' addenda.) With the voice of Andy Serkis, whose movements were also copied by the animators, Gollum is torn by his nature, and Mr. Jackson allows him to be conflicted in a way none of the other characters in the film are. 
This is partially because ''Towers'' is more or less a bridge to the finale of the ''Rings'' trilogy due a year from now, though this picture is one of the most accomplished holding actions ever. 
So, much of the flow of ''Towers'' is dictated by the amount of information that has to be saved for the next installment. Mr. Jackson compensates for that by inflating the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle against the endless, possessed armies of the villainous magician Saruman (Christopher Lee), the foe responsible for the fate of Gandalf. In his flowing white gowns and beard, Mr. Lee's warlock is a force to be reckoned with because he alone has a voice as commanding as Mr. McKellen's. 
In sheer action mechanics, Mr. Jackson's achievements in ''Towers'' are even more compelling than what he managed the first time around; he has given the martial scenes of this sequel a completely different thrust. His engrossing action style is exciting and dramatic; when the swells of Saruman's army crash into the walls of the king's castle, we could be watching Orson Welles's ''Chimes at Midnight'' as directed by George A. Romero -- Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. The exultant creepiness of horror films is Mr. Jackson's instinctive filmmaking style. He exaggerates it here in epic terms, and the grandeur is astonishing -- one scene of Saruman's creatures flinging themselves at the castle is framed as an overhead shot, with their shields moving like the wings of a peculiarly lyric and fatal insect. 
Mr. Jackson's mastery of craft in some areas is so powerful that the flaws are more noticeable than in the first film. The little-boy allure of the storytelling in ''Towers'' is sure to evoke the same reaction that it did in ''Fellowship.'' ''Towers'' is like a family-oriented E-rated video game, with no emotional complications other than saving the day. Women have so little to do here that they serve almost as plot-device flight attendants, offering a trough of Diet Coke to refresh the geek-magnet story. (It is a lapse in Tolkien's work that Mr. Jackson has not figured out a way to correct, even with the token reappearances of Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett from the first film.) 
Mr. McKellen is a marginal presence this time around, which is unfortunate because he is needed for ballast; ''Rings'' is such a kids' fantasy that a daddy figure is required. He is the father who soothes his charges under the spell of Tolkien's bad-dream threats. But he does get one -- only one -- whooping chance to do so in ''Towers.'' 
The most incredible accomplishment of ''Towers'' is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewer's attention. Because ''The Two Towers,'' which opens worldwide today, has to keep so much story in reserve for the last installment, the movie falls short on emotional involvement. Still, Mr. Jackson rises so completely to the challenges here that I can't wait to see his next movie -- by that, I mean the one after the ''Ring'' cycle ends. 
''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for pounding, long scenes of sword and flaming-catapult action and unsettling mystic evil.

‽Drumline‽,‽''Drumline,'' directed by Charles Stone III (''Paid in Full'') from a screenplay by Tina Gordon Chism and Shawn Shepps, celebrates a vibrant American cultural tradition. At historically black colleges like the fictitious Atlanta A&amp;T University and its real-life crosstown rival, Morris Brown College, a Saturday afternoon football game is something of an afterthought, an excuse to watch the marching bands engage in fiercely competitive battles of rhythm, choreography and showmanship. 
For more than 50 years, with ever greater flash and inventiveness, these ''show style'' bands have thrilled their fans with performances that combine military precision with breathtaking musical flair. 
''Drumline,'' which opens today nationwide, offers a generous showcase for this irresistible art form. The movie is structured like a musical, pinning a skimpy, hectic plot to rousing sequences of rhythmic invention, including both large-scale stadium-shaking production numbers and sharp, intense episodes of hand-to-hand musical combat. 
The story is nearly as crowded as a gridiron at halftime. Hundreds of musicians stomp and gyrate, but not enough of the collegiate musicians' discipline has rubbed off on the filmmakers. It hardly matters, since they have found an engaging lead actor in Nick Cannon, star of a self-titled series on Nickelodeon, and a subject that has waited too long for big-screen recognition. Spike Lee's ''School Daze'' and the long-running ''Cosby Show'' spinoff ''A Different World'' notwithstanding, African-American college life remains relatively unexplored territory in popular culture, a deficit ''Drumline'' should help to remedy. 
Mr. Cannon plays Devon Miles, a talented young drummer from Harlem who attends A&amp;T on a full scholarship. His high regard for his own skills and his streetwise individualism quickly come into conflict with the ritual and regimentation of the university's program. The lead drummer, Sean, who is threatened by Devon's gifts, soon becomes his nemesis. Their rivalry, and its inevitable resolution, provides the picture's most interesting and most sustained drama, though there is plenty more going on. 
The band's buttoned-up, old-school director, Dr. Lee (an unusually restrained Orlando Jones), is under pressure from the administration to produce more crowd-pleasing spectacles and to win back the national championship from his showboating mentor over at Morris Brown. Devon's romantic interest in a cheerleader (Zoë Saldana) provides a few tender moments; references to his troubled family background lend a touch of pathos; and a cast of stock secondary characters is on hand for occasional comic relief. These include a nerdy guy, a bulky tuba player, the drumline's token woman and an example of the latest movie stereotype, the white guy besotted with African-American music, culture and speech. (See also ''Barbershop.'' Ya feelin' me, dog?) 
If all this does not quite add up to a coherent movie, it does produce a bouncy, boisterous and charming one, which becomes downright thrilling when it shows the bands in action. Their musical style is an ebullient stew of influences that include hip-hop, jazz improvisation and New Orleans second-line marching music as well as classic funk and, thanks to Dr. Lee, ''The Flight of the Bumblebee.'' 
The climactic showdown -- staged during the BET marching band classic, without the distraction of football -- tops the rap battle at the end of ''8 Mile'' for suspense and inventiveness. As you watch the drummers pound out their polyrhythms and twirl their sticks, you may find it hard to stay in your seat. Mr. Stone wisely ends the movie there, on the field, freezing the frame while the splendid percussion rings in your ears. 
''Drumline'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity and a few sexual references.

‽The Hot Chick‽,‽In ''The Hot Chick,'' his bluntly titled new farce, the comic actor Rob Schneider runs an obstacle course of taste and emerges remarkably unsullied, considering the choices he faces. In portraying a spoiled teenage girl who wakes up in the body of a 30-year-old man, Mr. Schneider could have taken any number of potentially offensive tacks. Instead, he brings an almost doelike sweetness to the role of Jessica, a snooty high school cheerleader whose world suddenly shatters when she loses half a pair of stolen earrings that carry an ancient African curse. When a scruffy petty criminal discovers the lost earring at a gas station and tries it on, the two exchange bodies. 
''The Hot Chick,'' which opens today nationwide, is a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' which became a movie with Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan. In that slippery theatrical fairy tale, a young bride on her wedding day exchanges souls with a strange, ailing old man who appears at the wedding. Years later, the groom meets the old man and recognizes the soul of his long-lost beloved inside the geezer's crumbling flesh. 
Mr. Schneider's movie, which he wrote with his regular collaborator, Tom Brady, who directed, expresses the same faith in true love as ''Prelude to a Kiss'' but translates that message into the leering vocabulary of a teenage comedy. Although it takes a lot of convincing, Jessica's adoring boyfriend, Billy (Matthew Lawrence), eventually recognizes his sweetheart inside her new body. Even then, however, he can't bring himself to give her a kiss. 
If the movie is about an exchange of souls, most of its jokes revolve around the physical differences between boys and girls. The newly masculinized Jessica is horrified to discover hair growing in her nose and ears. And once she convinces her best high school friends that she is who she says she is (a remarkably easy task, considering what she looks like), they insist she show them her male private parts. Late in the movie, there is a delicately handled flirtation with lesbianism in which Jessica's closest friend, April (Anna Faris), confesses her attraction. 
But the movie, true to its genre, is not always so delicate. It is packed with dumb, farcical roughhouse in which Mr. Schneider, his eyes popping in querulous disbelief, is battered and tossed like a big, hairy rag doll. In the funniest scene, set in the men's room of a dance club, Jessica displays a total ignorance of male urination and has to be instructed by a kindly, dumbfounded attendant (Dick Gregory). 
The biggest problem facing Mr. Schneider's portrayal of a man with a dainty heart and soul was the necessity to avoid making the character an effeminate gay stereotype. And while the movie has its share of gay innuendo, it's careful to mute any homophobia. 
Jessica eventually emerges from her travails a better, more compassionate person. In her campaign to undo the curse, she has to enlist the uncool high school peers she used to scorn. In the guise of her family's Chicano gardener, she develops a buddy-buddy relationship with her father that helps her heal her parents' troubled marriage (but not before her sexually frustrated mother makes a lunging pass). 
And what of the man who finds himself in Jessica's sleek, well-tended body? The movie doesn't pay him much heed until the end, when it drags most of the major characters to the Pole Cat, a sleazy bar, where he is making a good living as a feisty exotic dancer. Rachel McAdams, who plays the pre-transformation Jessica, has to make a huge stretch from a snooty Britney Spears clone to a tigress. She is far more convincing as the former. 
''The Hot Chick'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It is loaded with off-color humor and sexual innuendo.

‽
‽Evelyn‽,‽When you hear that the new melodrama ''Evelyn'' is based on a true story about a ragged, determined dad who, abandoned by his wife, fought a brutal law to regain custody of his children -- including a little daughter with an unyielding belief in human charity and decency -- it sounds like a shovelful of sentimentality that even James Bond couldn't successfully battle. Yet in the person of Pierce Brosnan, he does. Though the film is spongy and drenched in sweetness, Bruce Beresford's direction is steady and well oiled. ''Evelyn'' has a breeziness of spirit; nothing lingers too long, for Mr. Beresford keeps the modest movie moving. 
The picture, which opens today in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, could actually be called ''Desmond.'' It's just as much about Desmond Doyle's fight against the Family Act of 1941, an Irish law that essentially deprived single fathers of the right to care for their children, as it is about Evelyn. (The movie ever so subtly offers the opinion that the Roman Catholic Church may have been behind this law, exploiting child labor in the bargain.) 
Mr. Brosnan's Desmond is a Dublin house painter in the 1950's whose wife leaves him the day after Christmas because she's bored. A brief glimpse of their marriage indicates it's nothing more than two sluggers in a grudge match. In one of the film's characteristic odd touches, the 9-year-old Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur) thinks her mom is running off to shop and tries to stop her because the stores are closed. 
Desmond's mother-in-law reports the situation to the authorities, and when Evelyn and her brothers are packed off to a convent and a monastery, the tortures of the damned surely await them. Evelyn, with a plentiful dusting of freckles on her nose and a firm, clean spirit, is the kind of target made for punishment by movie nuns, and she takes her share of licks; there's still little that's quite so shocking as seeing a child beaten in a movie. 
Mr. Beresford doesn't give the corporal punishment scenes here the voyeuristic treatment that makes such material seem staged for the delectation of an audience segment in serious need of therapy. The title sets up an expectation that the movie is going to show more of these horrors that Evelyn endures than it actually does. Fortunately, it's a promise Mr. Beresford doesn't feel he has to fulfill. The film works as a contrast to the dry self-consciousness of his ''Tender Mercies'' and the high-handed condescension of his ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' a movie that assumed black people liked being subservient. 
Desmond, whose real gift is soaking himself with ale at pubs, has to straighten up for the battle against church and state. Stephen Rea, a dandy of a lawyer helping with the case, makes these intimidating forces sound like an intersection. He is eventually joined by Aidan Quinn and Alan Bates, who is making a welcome return to the movies. Unfortunately, Mr. Bates's role as a former national football star who has become an esteemed though slightly daunted attorney is too raffishly charming. He's been given all the twinkle that even little Evelyn eschews. 
''Evelyn'' is slight and dogged; its surprises are likable but minor. Mr. Brosnan plays Desmond as a man who seems to be shaking off a fog; the deliberate repetitions of lines, a device he uses in his Bond movies to weigh the import of a sentence, is employed here to show a man trying to figure out what's going on. (Sometimes he seems even less bright than Sean Penn's mentally handicapped father in ''I Am Sam.'') Mr. Brosnan's deftness gives the film an enjoyable wrinkle, since he gets more out of vanity than any other actor. 
Given that any real sociopolitical impact has been removed from the Bond films, Mr. Brosnan makes the adventures important in a different way. His Bond takes every mission as a blow to his pride, and his Desmond does the same thing. It's a novel use of self-absorption, but in ''Evelyn'' he is finally roused from it by love of family. 
''Evelyn'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has cruelty to children, strong language and hearty ale consumption.

‽
‽Star Trek: Nemesis‽,‽Let's have a small round of applause for good old reliable ''Star Trek.'' Now deep into its fourth decade (if you count its television and screen incarnations) the science-fiction franchise, like the indestructible James Bond series, keeps chugging along inside its own cheerfully nostalgic time warp. 
New generations of adventurers may have seized the helm of the Starship Enterprise, but the replacement crews exhibit the same gung-ho spirit and twinkling faith in humanity as the original one. As long as these liberal humanist missionaries, working in clockwork harmony with their rainbow coalition of extraterrestrial and android colleagues, keep on going where no man has gone before, cornball 60's optimism will have a future. 
''Nemesis,'' the 10th ''Star Trek'' movie to appear since 1979 (and the fourth to feature the ''Next Generation'' crew), is an amiably klutzy affair whose warm, fuzzy heart emits intermittent bleats from the sleeve of its gleaming spacesuit. Although the action takes place outside our solar system, the movie is unapologetically and comfortingly Earth-centric. In the universe of ''Star Trek,'' Earth will always be the planet from which all progress emanates, especially healthy moral development. 
In keeping with the franchise's tradition of reflecting the science headlines of the moment, ''Nemesis,'' which opens today nationwide, addresses cloning and human personality with a psychotherapeutic earnestness. The core of the drama finds Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) confronting his evil clone, Shinzon (Tom Hardy), and realizing it isn't genes that determine personality but environment. 
That clone, a power-mad military dictator out to destroy first the Enterprise and then the Earth with a blast of radiation, may be a biological replica of the virtuous captain, but he doesn't have a nice bone in his body. To use the slangy argot of ''West Side Story,'' he's depraved on account of he's deprived. What sent the poor clone on the path to moral ruin was a miserable youth spent in exile, toiling in the extraterrestrial equivalent of a Siberian salt mine. 
For a certified biological replica, Shinzon doesn't look or sound much like his primary source except that both have shaved heads and cleft chins. In fact, Mr. Hardy, with his pudgy, full-lipped baby face and large glowering eyes, is in many ways the physical opposite of Mr. Stewart, who is all bony angles and cool slit-eyed vigilance. Shinzon is a really a futurist Caligula who speaks in the high, sour whine of a spoiled boy emperor throwing a hissy fit. That's quite a contrast to Mr. Stewart's captain with his ringing Shakespearean bass-baritone and imperturbable calm. 
The confrontation between the captain and his clone involves a fairly intricate elaborate setup. The story begins with the wedding of Officer William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes, who directed two earlier ''Star Trek'' movies but not this one) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). As the Enterprise travels from a wedding reception in Riker's native Alaska toward Troi's home world of Betazed, where a second ceremony is to be performed, the ship is sidetracked by an electromagnetic disturbance from the planet Kolarus III. Exploring its terrain, the crew discovers parts of an android that includes a severed talking head. That head turns out to be a crude prototype of the Enterprise's resident android, Commander Data (Brent Spiner), who takes it back to the ship for testing. 
The Enterprise is sidetracked again when the bellicose Romulans, longtime enemies of the Federation, announce to Picard that their new leader wants to negotiate a peace treaty with the Federation. Picard is understandably suspicious, but he agrees to meet with the new Praetor, as he is called. To his surprise, that leader, Shinzon, turns out not to be a Romulan but a native of Romulus's sister planet, Remus. 
Picard's clone was developed by the Romulans to deploy as a weapon against the Federation but was never used and was eventually exiled into the hellish dilithium mines of Remus. Shinzon has risen to power under the tutelage of a sinister Reman Viceroy (Ron Perlman) and returned to Romulus to rule as a military dictator over his creators, who are none too happy with his agenda. 
If the screenplay by John Logan (a writer for ''Gladiator'') -- from a story by Mr. Logan, Mr. Spiner and the series's longtime producer and writer Rick Berman -- is riddled with holes to spare, it is true to the spirit of the ''Star Trek'' ethos. And in paralleling the similarities between Data and the severed head of his prototype (which Shinzon used as bait to bring the Enterprise into his sphere) with those between Picard and his clone, it buttresses the movie's philosophy that a sustained personal commitment to self-improvement can humanize androids and even turn bad seeds into good ones. 
In the movie's climactic speech, Picard lectures his embittered clone on the benefits of being a better person. The movie's sentimental faith in the power of positive thinking is further reiterated in its images of an android croaking out the lyrics to Irving Berlin's ''Blue Skies.'' 
''Star Trek: Nemesis,'' directed by Stuart Baird (''Executive Decision,'' ''U.S. Marshals''), is so determined to deliver colorful action that it stretches out its final battle sequence much longer than necessary and reaches two or three possible conclusions before finally ringing down the curtain. The most exciting moment arrives when one spaceship deliberately rams into another. The accumulating destruction, grand and protracted, suggests the collision of two great ocean liners. 
''Star Trek: Nemesis'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mild violence and horror effects.

The video may show her canoodling on the deck of a sailboat with the handsome Ben Affleck, her latest beau, and lounging half-dressed on an expensive-looking sofa in a lovely high-rise apartment, but the lyrics insist that at heart she is still a striving, streetwise Puerto Rican girl from New York City. 
Ms. Lopez's new movie, the blandly charming romantic comedy ''Maid in Manhattan,'' makes a similar point. Her character, Marisa Ventura, is a single mother who lives in the Bronx and makes her living cleaning rooms in a super-luxurious Manhattan hotel. Even when her fortunes take a fairy-tale turn and she briefly trades in her maid's uniform for a creamy Dolce &amp; Gabbana coat (and, later, a ravishing evening dress accessorized with a Harry Winston necklace), Marisa does not lose her tough, determined attitude. The film's message, like the song's, is that upward mobility is not a betrayal of working-class values but rather their ultimate fulfillment. 
This is an appealing idea -- one that has sustained film comedies at least since the Depression. And Ms. Lopez, even in underwritten, not-funny-enough pictures like this one (or the earlier, somewhat similar ''Wedding Planner'') has some of the forthright magnetism of an old-time movie star. In the steamy ''Jenny From the Block'' video, she shows off her body, giving the cable subscribers of America generous glimpses of what may be, in celebrity if not in size, the biggest backside in the world. (At one point Mr. Affleck, to the envy of millions, uses it as a pillow.) 
In contrast, ''Maid in Manhattan,'' which opens today nationwide, is chastely directed by Wayne Wang from a script by Kevin Wade that contains just a few (perhaps contractually obligatory) references to that famous aspect of Ms. Lopez's anatomy, and it demonstrates that the most potent source of her sexiness is her eyes. You would have to go back to Claudette Colbert or the young Lauren Bacall to find an actress capable of projecting so much erotic self-confidence in a single gaze. And even when Marisa suffers inevitable humiliations and reversals of fortune, Ms. Lopez retains a suave, straight-backed dignity that makes her a credible feminist heroine as well as a bona fide sex symbol. 
Unfortunately, her charisma is hampered by the blandness and banality of the movie itself, which squanders nearly every comic opportunity its urban Cinderella premise provides. Mr. Wang, whose earlier films include ''The Joy Luck Club,'' ''Smoke'' and the wonderful ''Chan Is Missing,'' has a palpable if sentimental affection for multiethnic urban life and an understated feel for both the indignities and the occasional pleasures of hard work in the service sector. 
He respects the professionalism of the hotel workers and the friendly, relaxed solidarity that makes their jobs more bearable. The staff includes Bob Hoskins as a butler whose whispery punctiliousness recalls Anthony Hopkins in ''Remains of the Day,'' Marissa Matrone as Marisa's wisecracking best pal and Chris Eigeman as the predictably uptight manager. All of them show suitable professionalism, but Mr. Wang and Mr. Wade have made them all a little too nice to be funny. 
In general the picture is so committed to inoffensiveness and to hammering home its uplifting, bootstrap message that it lacks the necessary element of malice. The only safe satirical scapegoats are rich, single middle-aged women, like Caroline Lane, a brittle and snobbish Sotheby's executive played by Natasha Richardson, and her leathery, bigoted exercise partner (the hilarious and underused Amy Sedaris). They have some humorous moments, but scenes that should have a breakneck, spring-loaded rhythm unwind lazily without silliness or precision. 
The plot, which might have been a fizzy exercise in latter-day screwball comedy, is set in motion when Marisa tries on some of Caroline's clothes and with the help of her 10-year-old son (Tyler Garcia Posey) catches the eye of Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a wealthy state assemblyman contemplating a run for the United States Senate seat once held by his father. 
Marshall, whom the tabloids have dubbed ''the playboy politico'' and who is devoted to his large dog, is held on a tight leash by his adviser (Stanley Tucci), but he and Marisa nonetheless find time for a stroll in Central Park, where romantic sparks are kindled. Or at least they would be if Mr. Fiennes were not such a damp, milky presence. He tries for a fumbling, rich-guy charm but instead projects a diffidence unsuited either to an ambitious politician or a romantic lead. It's impossible to imagine this guy in bed with an Albany lobbyist, much less with Ms. Lopez. 
Marshall does have one remarkable trait: he is a Republican. An environmentalist, silk-stocking John Lindsay type, to be sure, but still, after Spencer Tracy in ''State of the Union,'' you could probably count the sympathetic big-screen members of the G.O.P. on the fingers of one hand. In any case, Marshall's party affiliation, which is no big deal for Marisa, can count as a touch of realism, given the current shape of New York politics. 
And to its credit ''Maid in Manhattan,'' more than most films of its kind, does try to find a balance between realism and whimsy, to suggest connections between the fantasy it projects and the world as it is. I only wish it were funnier, more persuasive and less pep-talky and that it came closer in spirit and execution to the studio comedies of the 1930's -- movies like ''Easy Living'' or ''Midnight'' -- which are its obvious models. 
Perhaps, though, such gauzy, biting social comedies are no longer possible, which leads to a troubling thought. For movies like ''Maid in Manhattan'' to get much better, the economy may have to get much worse. 
''Maid in Manhattan'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mild profanity and some discreet sexual scenes and references.

‽
‽Analyze That‽,‽For those who find more reality than they can easily stomach in the season's harrowing final episodes of ''The Sopranos,'' ''Analyze That'' offers instant antacid relief. As the lightheaded sequel to the 1999 hit comedy ''Analyze This'' evaporates across the screen, its low-cal effervescence emanates from the comfortably goofy chemistry of its stars, Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Reprising their roles of a mob boss, Paul Vitti, and his beleaguered psychotherapist, Ben Sobel, Mr. De Niro and Mr. Crystal exude a breezy camaraderie that recalls Bing Crosby and Bob Hope ambling jauntily down some nonsensical road to nowhere. 
From the moment Paul, imprisoned in Sing Sing, fakes a psychotic break and begins maniacally singing ''I Feel Pretty'' inside his cell and then lapses into feigned catatonia, ''Analyze That'' turns into a kind of mob vaudeville show in which there is not much difference between a whacking and a ''West Side Story'' ditty delivered in mob dialect. The ludicrous finale is a rendition of ''Somewhere'' bellowed on a waterfront promenade facing Lower Manhattan. 
The movie, directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay he wrote with Peter Steinfeld and Peter Tolan, is contented to be a loose-jointed series of skits, laced with running jokes that poke mild fun at mob movie clichés and therapeutic psychobabble. The most prominent of those leitmotifs, the cliché that grief is ''a process,'' is repeated enough times to become an annoying tic. 
For Mr. De Niro, the role of Paul is a piece of cake because it doesn't appear to involve any work. One reason the star has enjoyed such success in comedy is that audiences feel an instinctive relief from the intensity of his screen persona when he lightens up. In ''Analyze That'' he somersaults off his Great Actor pedestal to become just another Hollywood star hamming it up with his buddies in front the camera. Spoofing his own screen image, he is like a little boy scrunching his face into silly expressions while peering into a mirror, the menace in his slivery eyes brightened by a twinkle signaling that it's all in fun. ''See, it's easy?'' he seems to be saying with a big wink. ''Dark or light, it's only playacting.'' 
Mr. Crystal's Ben conveys a similar on-again-off-again sense of a star alternately toying with a role and just being himself on a well-paid professional vacation. It's always reassuring for audiences to glimpse the vulnerable neurotic behind a therapist's omniscient mask. And in a story that plays with role reversals, Ben, smarting from the death of a father whom he remembers as cold and withholding, experiences paroxysms of neurotic self-doubt. 
But those twitches are never more than airy comic shtick. Behind Mr. Crystal's clowning, there is always the sense of a shrewd, quick-witted comic who keeps a cache of chicken soup simmering behind the curtain. Should an emergency arise, he would be the first to start dishing it out. Eventually, Ben finds himself accompanying a crew of mobsters during a heist in Lower Manhattan. At a critical moment he is forced to save the day by becoming a man of action. 
The story to which these characters have been attached is a bogus contraption wrested from the same twilight zone of television sitcom where hillbillies find themselves in Beverly Hills and buxom, chirping genies materialize to satisfy the whims of their bumbling masters. Under the stern eye of a United States attorney, Paul is discharged from Sing Sing and put in Ben's custody. Ensconced in the doctor's home, he lunges around like the proverbial bull in a china shop, keeping the Sobels awake at night as he cavorts noisily with a prostitute and disrupts a solemn family gathering by appearing in his pajamas to chase the same woman out of the house amid a flurry of curses. 
Although Paul declares he wants to leave the world of crime for legitimate employment, he doesn't try very hard and soon finds himself and his old crew forced to choose sides between rival mob clans, one of them led by Patty LoPresti (Cathy Moriarty-Gentile). In her brief screen appearances, Ms. Moriarty-Gentile, blonder than ever, is as salty a presence as she was two decades ago in ''Raging Bull.'' 
The movie's cleverest notion is to have Paul hired as a consultant for a television series based on ''Little Caesar.'' At his suggestion his mobster friends are brought on to the set to heighten the realism. Although there is the germ of a very sharp comedy in the intersection of real mobsters and make-believe thugs in a Hollywood mob comedy, ''Analyze That'' is far too lazy to do much with it. 
A scene in which the series' Australian star (Anthony LaPaglia) consults Paul for acting tips falls flat. In a cheap shot, the movie makes that series' director an effeminate, hoity-toity refugee from the theater. Poor Lisa Kudrow is wasted in the one-note role of Ben's gently nagging wife, Laura. The choicest smaller performance is Joe Viterelli's sweetly avuncular portrayal of Paul's slit-eyed rhino-size right-hand man, Jelly. 
Given the success of both phenomena, it was probably inevitable that ''Analyze That,'' which opens nationwide today, plays off ''The Sopranos'' in its show-within-a-show concept. Although they may be cousins, the artistic gap between them is as large as the chasm separating a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch from ''Crime and Punishment.'' 
''Analyze That'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and moderate violence.

‽
‽Equilibrium‽,‽In ''Equilibrium,'' which takes place in the not too distant future, emotion has been outlawed. But some things are still the same; the Cadillac STS is still available (though masking tape is applied to hide its markings). And it is driven by a new breed of law-enforcement officer called -- and please don't laugh until I finish this -- Grammaton Cleric, assigned to squash the sense crimes of what could be called the emotion underground. 
The Clerics -- who are all men, so women are even more repressed -- practice a particularly nasty martial and handgun art called Gunkata. In the near future, I guess, bullets are neither deadly nor photogenic enough to accomplish the job. 
One of these men, John Preston (Christian Bale), is at the center of ''Equilibrium,'' a ridiculous sci-fi action melodrama and breath mint. If someone left ''1984,'' ''Fahrenheit 451,'' ''Brave New World,'' ''Gattaca'' and the Sylvester Stallone potboilers ''Judge Dredd'' and ''Demolition Man'' out in the sun and threw the runny glop onto a movie screen, it would still be a better picture than ''Equilibrium,'' a movie that could be stupider only if it were longer. 
Emotion, it seems, caused a third world war. To prevent a fourth, feelings have been made illegal, done away with by a drug called Prozium, which citizens administer to themselves daily. Based on the slender, concave shape of faces of the future, Prozium is as effective a weight-loss tool as those sandwiches at Subway. 
The slender, sleek Preston has repressed everything about himself, including Mr. Bale's English accent. He has the mid-Atlantic vowels of one of the D.J.'s at a Virgin megastore. Devoted and loyal in carrying out the orders of the government, Preston stumbles into the underground when it turns out that one of them was (gasp) right next to him -- his own Cleric partner, whom he executes. 
His confidence shaken because he thought himself intuitive enough to know what was going on in the mind of any man, Preston is given an ambitious and perhaps even more empathetic young partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs, whose cheekbones are even more beautiful than Mr. Bale's). And there are further fissures in Preston's resolve; his wife was also executed for sense crimes, leaving him a widower with two young children. 
When he starts to have, um, feelings for the beautiful underground member (Emily Watson) he has just arrested, a question arises: Will Preston forsake the road before him for the pursuit of real, live emotion? 
''Equilibrium,'' which opens nationwide today, is pretty silly stuff. The writer and director, Kurt Wimmer, has obviously made a movie where independent thought has been banished, since the whole picture looks like Ridley Scott's Orwellian Apple commercial from 1984. I'm as up as anyone for a well-staged action sequence, but the punches thrown here make the movie look as if it was based on a video game. 
The Clerics' fascist chic wardrobe and their Gunkata will probably have the makers of ''The Matrix'' scouring every frame for copyright infringement. The true sleaziness comes after Preston beats a brace of fellow cops to their bloody, picturesque deaths to protect a puppy from execution. Just when you think ''Equilibrium'' can't sink any lower, the movie slaughters shame, too. 
''Equilibrium'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, gunfights, advanced pistol whipping, suggestions of immolation and threats to a tail-wagging pooch. 
EQUILIBRIUM 
Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer; director of photography, Dion Beebe; edited by Tom Rolf and William Yeh; music by Klaus Badelt; production designer, Wolf Kroeger; produced by Jan De Bont and Lucas Foster; released by Dimension Films. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽Extreme Ops‽,‽It is hard to say what ''Extreme Ops'' is a bigger waste of -- film or time. In this extremely boring stunts compilation, the hilariously named military strongman Slobovan Pavlov (Klaus Löwitsch), who is hiding out from the world in a remote winter resort under construction, is so stupid that he thinks a pack of wild, partying snowboarders is a group of C.I.A. operatives. He valiantly sets out to kill them. 
This burst of plot occurs in the final 20 or so minutes of the movie; its intense drama was broken only by the heavy footfalls of two of the five audience members leaving the theater. This may mean that the holiday box-office gross of ''Extreme Ops'' will be cut by almost half because they seemed out to collect a refund. 
Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing, moldering pile of, well, extreme stunt pictures, ''Extreme Ops'' mostly follows Ian (Rufus Sewell). This director of commercials and his production crew members are off to a spectacular snowy locale, where they are making an advertisement for a video camera, the Avalanche. 
Ian's partner, Jeffrey (Rupert Graves), who wears Burberry-tartan loafers, decides they will shoot the spot in an actual avalanche. Ian's right-hand man, Will (Devon Sawa), assembles a ski-stunt team. One of its members, Silo (Joe Absolom), is so intense he can be found skateboarding on the tops of trains or in airport baggage claim areas. Kittie (Jana Pallaske) is equally wild, and not at all interested in Will romantically, despite his puppyish entreaties. The video-bug Will uses a palm-size video camera -- a Panasonic, not the Avalanche -- to film everything, including a shot of Slobby Pavlov canoodling with his honey. (This, too, sets off that quick-tempered incognito war criminal.) 
It is hard to understand why ''Extreme Ops'' couldn't have been shown to critics before its release, because it seems to have been made in 1996 for ESPN2. When the would-be outlaws Silo and Kittie make fun of the championship downhill racer Chloe (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) because of her old-fogy sport, you wonder why she doesn't slap them back by saying that snowboarding is now so mainstream that it's an Olympic event. 
''Ops'' is too brain-dead to play the incognito war criminal segment for comedy, although when Will is seen thumbing through the pages of a newspaper called USA Daily, the picture has inadvertently tumbled down a Mad magazine wormhole. Mr. Sewell manages to keep his footing by giving the driest line readings imaginable; he is a true professional under the impression that he is in a real movie. (Ian's incredulity when he discovers that Chloe actually wears her gold medal will almost make this movie worth sitting through when it turns up on cable.) 
If ''Extreme Ops'' has anything going for it -- and believe me, that's one of the bigger ifs in movie history -- then that would be the stunt work. There is a fun scene of Will and Kittie boarding through billowing clouds of fresh white powder at night. And a sequence in which Will and Silo must dodge a pair of guard dogs while executing pratfall tumbles and flips in an unfinished wing of the ski lodge is eye-popping; the stunt coordinators earned their money on this one. 
But for those of you with more important holiday plans, like washing your hair -- and I'm sure there are many of you with such pressing schedules -- don't worry about missing ''Extreme Ops.'' Most of the stunts will probably be recycled in the opening of the next James Bond picture. 
''Extreme Ops'' is rated PG-13 for video-game-style extreme snow stunts, strong language and spin-the-bottle sexuality. 
EXTREME OPS

‽
‽Solaris‽,‽Whether gazing darkly over the ocean from a captain's perch in ''The Perfect Storm'' or contemplating the viscous, shape-shifting reality of a mysterious planet from a space station in his new movie ''Solaris,'' George Clooney projects the brooding solipsism of a man's-man encased in a shell of loneliness. In the Hollywood pantheon of recycled heroes, he suggests a Clark Gable for the new millennium, without the raised eyebrow and rakish leer. That space station, the setting for most of ''Solaris,'' is a gleaming, sterile pod that feels increasingly claustrophobic as this solemn science-fiction fable prepares to dispense its intriguing riddles. The world of ''Solaris'' may be a universe away from the frothy Las Vegas gloss of ''Ocean's Eleven,'' this star's last collaboration with Steven Soderbergh, who directed both movies. But Mr. Clooney's guarded insularity injects both films with steady dark bass notes. 
''Solaris'' observes its characters in semi-shadow much of the time. Mr. Clooney's eyes glisten through the gloom like shiny black coals studded into a craggy twilit landscape. 
But a third of the way into the film, Mr. Clooney's shell begins to crack. As his character, Chris Kelvin, starts to unravel, the grimy rivulets of guilt and longing leaking out of him lend the movie a palpable subterranean ache. Chris's tears aren't the warm, cathartic sobs of a grieving Rhett Butler softened by one too many brandies, but the tremors of a man who thought he had all the answers suddenly confronting a scary metaphysical conundrum. 
A psychiatrist called upon to investigate the increasingly irrational behavior of a crew posted at a distant space station named the Prometheus, Chris continues to mourn the suicide of his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), years after her death. As he confronts forces that might be described as a kind of virtual reality emanating from his own mind, his certainty of what is real and what is not begins to crumble, and a lifetime of stifled doubts and regrets rears up to haunt him. 
''Solaris'' was adapted from the Polish science-fiction writer Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel, which also inspired a 1972 film by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. The story turns out to be a kind of aesthetic Rorschach for filmmakers. 
In the hands of Mr. Soderbergh, collaborating with the producer James Cameron (who directed ''Titanic''), many of the fussy scientific and philosophical details of the two previous incarnations have been discarded. Retooled into a sleek pop fable that doesn't bother to connect all its dots, the movie aspires to fuse the mystical intellectual gamesmanship of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' with the love-beyond-the-grave romantic schmaltz of ''Titanic,'' without losing its cool. It's a tricky balancing act that doesn't quite come off. 
Because Mr. Soderbergh is the farthest thing from a pop sentimentalist, the movie's strain of Kubrickian skepticism dampens any Cameronian romantic heat. The chill is only accentuated by Cliff Martinez's ethereally melancholy score of synthesized pulses filtered through strings. 
Arriving at the space station, Chris discovers that the mission's commander, Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), who summoned him but refused to say what was wrong, has committed suicide. The two remaining scientists, Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Viola Davis), are exhibiting symptoms of acute paranoia presumably brought on by their scientific inquiries. Snow is a giggling, maniacal trickster, while Gordon refuses to leave her quarters. One tantalizing clue as to what's happening is the realization that the oceanic planet under examination seems to be reacting to the scientists' presence, as though it knows it's being observed. 
Once he awakens after a troubled sleep to find his dead wife lying beside him restored to life, Chris finds himself surrendering to the same unnerving phenomena. The heart of the film is his agonized dialogue with this flesh-and-blood phantom woman who seems physically real but whose selective memory suggests that she is only a mental projection of what he remembers of her. 
As the couple rake over their past, we learn that the bitterest bone of contention between them was Rheya's failure to inform Chris of her infertility before they were married. Now, in her resurrected state, she appears weirdly indestructible. 
The movie goes out of its way to emphasize that Mr. Clooney's Chris and Ms. McElhone's Rheya are no futuristic Leo and Kate locked in eternal puppy love but a sorrowful couple who weathered many battles while married. Her wide eyes staring hawklike out of her angular mask of a face, Ms. McElhone's Rheya projects a forbidding sensuality. Even when she becomes emotionally unstrung, her eruptions have the slightly robotic quality of the android she might well turn out to be. 
As the fable accumulates more layers of ambiguity, it recalls ''The Cage,'' the seldom-seen pilot episode of ''Star Trek'' in which the starship commander (played by Jeffrey Hunter) is disfigured in battle and imprisoned by a mentally advanced, but physically depleted tribe of telepathic aliens who use him for their pleasure. In the episode's ambiguously happy ending, he and an equally damaged woman end up living in a shared romantic illusion that becomes their captors' erotic entertainment. Heaven may exist, the episode suggests, but it's just a manipulated fantasy. 
In toying with some of the same ideas, ''Solaris'' throws in such enigmatic touches as the appearance of an unsmiling deific child extending its hand to Chris like Michelangelo's God creating the first man. But ''Solaris'' is too coolheaded to make a big fuss over such imagery. The last thing it wants to do is soothe us with grandiose assurances from the ''Touched by an Angel'' playbook. 
The movie, which opens nationwide today, is visually handsome in an austere way. Its space station, which from the outside resembles two interlocking bicycles, has an interior that suggests an elegant oversize Laundromat with furniture that reminds you of giant computer keyboards. Solaris itself is a golden, rainbow-flecked swirl of matter that exerts an increasingly irresistible gravitational pull. 
But once the novelty of the space station has worn off, the movie's atmosphere begins to feel uncomfortably cramped and stifling. For ''Solaris'' is a science-fiction film lacking action-adventure sequences. The absence of boyish friskiness, kineticism and pyrotechnics makes it a film that offers no vicarious physical release. Its insistence on remaining cerebral and somber to the end may be a sign of integrity, but it should cost it dearly at the box office. 
''Solaris'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and discreetly photographed moments of nudity.

‽Broken Wings‽,‽The performances in ''Broken Wings,'' Nir Bergman's aching domestic drama, are so finely meshed that the actors playing the Ullmans, an Israeli family shattered by the recent death of the head of the household, project the weary, lived-in kinship of people who have flailed in too close proximity for far too long. 
The unhappy realism of ''Broken Wings,'' Mr. Bergman's feature film debut, isn't pleasant to contemplate. Although plenty of love floats among the Ullmans, so do bottled-up rage, despair and guilt, which leak out in sudden explosions of hostility and self-destruction, and the volatility of family life gives you a sense of emotional claustrophobia. If only the Ullmans could get away from one another for a little while, you think, they would be so much happier. 
Dafna (Orli Zilberschatz-Banai), the financially strapped widow and mother of four, has recently taken a low-paying job as a night-shift midwife in a Haifa hospital after being bedridden for three months with depression. To hold down the job, Dafna reluctantly entrusts the care of her two youngest children, Ido (Daniel Magon), an alarmingly reckless 11-year-old, and Bahr (Eliana Magon), a sullen 6-year-old, to the oldest two, 17-year-old Maya (Maya Maron), and her 16-year-old brother, Yair (Nitai Gvirtz). 
Traumatized by their father's death and furious at having to shoulder responsibilities they would not normally have to handle, Maya and Yair are less than ideal candidates for surrogate parents, but they have no choice. Maya, an aspiring singer and composer for a rock band that is moving to Tel Aviv, is itching to flee Haifa. (Her touching song for her father opens and closes the movie.) Yair, a once promising basketball player, has become an indolent high school dropout who contemptuously counters friendly overtures with his bitter, nihilistic rants about there being no God and no truth. 
Yair and Maya are still considered too disruptive to be allowed back in school. Yair's latest opportunity for re-entry is foiled by his refusal to respond to the words father, fear and anger, tossed at him by a school counselor in a word association test. 
Maya rebels against Dafna by repeatedly ignoring or forgetting her instructions. When one of her small acts of forgetfulness precipitates a grave new crisis, Dafna snaps. One afternoon, Ido, unsupervised, pursues his favorite daredevil pastime, jumping into empty swimming pools. This time he hits his head and goes into a coma. 
The movie's sense of emotional claustrophobia is underscored by a complete lack of interest in Middle Eastern politics, or in anything outside the troubled family unit. ''Broken Wings,'' which opens today in New York, doesn't have a word to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nor does it give a sense of the existence of that conflict as background noise in the Ullmans' lives. 
Though incisive, the screenplay (by Mr. Bergman) resorts to some coy strategies to drum up a modicum of suspense. Although we're told of the father's death fairly early in the film, the actual circumstances aren't revealed until near the end. We also wait to discover whether Ido remains comatose. 
For all the sourness and impatience that erupt out of its characters' misery, ''Broken Wings'' makes you believe in the Ullmans and in the power of their mutual love to see them through. In the end, it suggests, given half a chance, we go on. 
''Broken Wings'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity and some strong language.

‽Confessions of a Burning Man‽,‽Directed by Unsu Lee and Paul Barnett 
Not rated, 80 minutes 
''Confessions of a Burning Man,'' an incoherent documentary about the annual Burning Man arts festival in the northern Nevada desert, makes the fatal flaw of cinematically imitating the anarchistic spirit of the event it observes. The 10-day festival, which draws more than 25,000 people annually to the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, where a temporary city is created and then disassembled, is a kind of modern-day Woodstock festival with a new-age, survivalist, environmentally sensitive aesthetic. 
The participants complete and then remove large, fanciful artworks, many of which have a magical, childlike charm. At the center of the festival is a giant wooden effigy of a man that is ritually burned each year. While the festival lasts, it is often a battle against the elements. Despite the brutal environment, with its frequent sandstorms and extremes of temperature, the festival becomes a giant outdoor circus cum science fair cum art project peopled with jugglers, clowns, yoga instructors and nudists, euphorically cavorting into the wee hours. 
Although there is much to say about the history, aesthetics and philosophy of Burning Man (its founder, Larry Harvey, does a lamentably sketchy job), the film, which opens today in New York, is too lazy and too loosely structured to accomplish much besides conveying some vivid physical impressions. There is no narrator, and the structure that exists is clouded by the new-age mumbo-jumbo of eight principal commentators. 
As these dull, inarticulate people ramble on about their personal traumas and breakthroughs, they suggest the largest, most self-centered outdoor therapy group ever assembled. In the matter of drugs the movie is patently dishonest. Although there is not a single mention of drug-taking in the entire film, it's perfectly apparent that the community spirit of Burning Man would be unimaginable without the fuel of mind-altering chemicals.

‽Peter Pan‽,‽Admirers of Peter Pan from J. M. Barrie's novel, rather than from the many stage and screen versions, will find a kindred spirit in P. J. Hogan, the Australian director whose film adaptation of the book opens nationwide today. 
Mr. Hogan's previous movies ''Muriel's Wedding'' and ''My Best Friend's Wedding'' do not at first glance seem to be the work of a filmmaker drawn to the spectacle and enchantment of modern children's entertainment. 
But the sharp, sometimes stinging emotional acuity he demonstrated in those spiky, heartfelt comedies makes him an ideal interpreter of Barrie's work. The Peter Pan books are intended to disturb as well as comfort; in seducing young readers into the pleasures of literature they also teache them to appreciate various forms of unhappiness. They are magical and exciting, but also frightening and sad; their beautifully balanced themes are the delights of childhood and the pathos of leaving it behind. 
Mr. Hogan understands both themes, and his filmmaking style is a perfect mixture of wide-eyed wonder and slightly melancholy sophistication. 
While Peter, played by 14-year-old Jeremy Sumpter, is appropriately dashing and adventurous, and Tink (Ludivine Sagnier) is as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. 
Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display her childlike eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that ''Peter Pan,'' beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. 
That aspect of the movie may bring a lump to adult throats, but in the meantime there are the sturdy delights of swordplay, Neverland ritual and flight. Mr. Hogan, the production designer Roger Ford and the cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine (who also shot Baz Luhrmann's ''Moulin Rouge'') conjure a Neverland of lurid purple shadows and thick, brightly colored foliage. Any version of ''Peter Pan'' depends on the vitality of its villain, and Jason Isaacs (who also plays the timid Mr. Darling, as well as the reptilian Lucius Malfoy in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'') is stagily vicious and histrionically self-pitying as Captain Hook. When Hook meets his end, as the children chant ''old, unwanted, alone!'' from the decks of his creaking ship, it is hard to suppress a twinge of sympathy for the poor old pirate. 
You also feel the grief of Mrs. Darling (Olivia Williams) as she pines beside an open window for her vanished children, and the loneliness of Peter. All of this feeling is a mark of just how thoroughly Mr. Hogan has succeeded in evading the sentimentality that infects so many recent children's movies. 
Imagination is dangerous, but the loss of imagination is deadly. Being a child is frightening -- there are certainly scenes here that will jolt the sensitivities of young children -- but growing up is painful. Like Barrie, Mr. Hogan grasps these difficult truths, and knows how to spin them into utter, uncomplicated delight. 
''Peter Pan'' is rated PG. It has swordplay and gunplay and a few violent Neverland deaths.

‽
‽Paycheck‽,‽John Woo directing a Philip K. Dick adaptation: that certainly sounds like the opposite of coal in the stocking, or as good as a gift certificate from RadioShack. At least it might have sounded that way in 1990. 
Since then Dick's posthumous legacy has suffered through movies like ''Impostor,'' and Mr. Woo made ''Windtalkers.'' 
For Mr. Woo, whose action-man motifs have been looted so thoroughly by other filmmakers that he could qualify for a creative version of Chapter 11, audience expectations are probably close to flatlining. 
Yet ''Paycheck,'' which open today nationwide, is surprisingly . . . ept given that it is basically a dumb movie about smart people. This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could expect from such a collaboration, especially when Ben Affleck, an actor whose calm exterior reflects an inability to project an inner life, enters the mix. 
Mr. Affleck is Michael Jennings, a hotshot who has put his electronic genius out for hire to steal the ideas and properties of corporations and then refine them for competitors. It almost sounds like the story of Microsoft Word versus Apple except that for legal reasons Michael gets his mind wiped clean by a dangerous medical process that nearly boils his brain. This procedure also eliminates Michael's memory of the entire period he spent at work, all for a paycheck. 
When a new, less dangerous memory-elimination procedure comes along, one that can safely do away with three years instead of a few months, Michael is invited by his old friend Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) to get involved in a project that could change the world and net Michael an eight-figure income. 
Michael will come out three years later with a larger bank balance, but with no idea of his accomplishments; it would be like winning a Golden Globe. The sleek, ascetic paranoia that Dick triggered in his short story ''Paycheck'' surfaces; it is the kind of home invasion of the mind and soul that inspired films based on the stories ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' (''Blade Runner'') and ''I Can Dream It for You Wholesale'' (''Total Recall''). 
For Dick, having one's psyche manhandled was the most staggering crime imaginable; a million dollars was a mad chunk of cheddar in his world, but even today people are subjected to worse manipulation on ''The Bachelor'' for considerably less. 
Dramatizing the terror that Dick saw in surrendering three years of one's life to someone else has fallen into the hands of a filmmaker whose techniques have been so rigorously studied and overused that Mr. Woo's life could be the subject of a Dick short story. 
But ''Paycheck'' the film is not shocking; it is merely facile and unsettling. The Michael's troubled look while wrestling with his decision suggests annoyance, as if he had to walk an extra block to find a Leaf and Bean, rather than any agony over yielding control of his existence. 
So ''Paycheck'' becomes a glib, scrambling action picture about Michael trying to pick up his life after emerging from his job and finding that everything has gone wrong: he is implicated in murder, and almost everyone on his tail is more interested in shooting first and asking questions later. And he has no memory to use to piece things together, just an envelope of personal possessions that don't match the items he had deposited three years earlier. His use of the stuff in the envelope makes ''Paycheck'' feel like a big episode of ''McGyver,'' and Mr. Affleck's confused sheepishness makes the conceit mildly entertaining. 
''Paycheck'' is not much of a movie, though Mr. Affleck and Mr. Woo have definitely done worse. It could have been directed by anyone; unfortunately, Mr. Woo's gift for exploiting tension in closed spaces deserted him so long ago that it could be declared legally dead. (But there is a motorcycle-and-car chase sequence that gets his juices going.) 
He works best with actors who understand the physical threat and plunge into the danger anyway. Paul Giamatti, as Michael's scientist pal, gets it. The ''Six Feet Under'' star Michael C. Hall, in his first feature film role as one of the cops prowling the situation room, is relegated to crossing his arms and raising a single eyebrow, a staple of too many recent Woo films. 
As for Mr. Affleck, he is showing signs of becoming a believable action star; his stick-boxing technique is better here than in ''Daredevil.'' He looks good in the man-of-action Oswald Boateng-styled suits, designed to give him a futuristic cross between the man in an Arrow shirt ad and a character in ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.'' 
Then again, most of the characterization in ''Paycheck'' is linked to appearance. For the sinister Rethrick, overzealous use of hair-care products makes the same impression that mustache wax did for silent-film villains. 
Only Uma Thurman, as Rachel, a co-worker Michael may have loved in the past, draws on feelings that seem connected to the real world. She is the victim of psychic loss of the kind Dick describes; the collapse of her features when gazing at an unsure Michael provides a fleeting sadness. And she delivers a pretty impressive drop-kick. 
Too bad it didn't occur to anyone to make her the lead. 
''Paycheck'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), which means the cast members must dodge a lot of gunfire and shattered glass while using strong language, consuming alcohol and suggesting sexuality. Happy holidays.

‽
‽The Young Black Stallion‽,‽The large-screen Imax film process is a form in search of content. Able to create an image several stories tall with crystalline clarity, this 70-millimeter format is so overwhelming that it upstages whatever material it presents. Call it the wow effect: when the viewer is knocked out by the visual splendor, it is difficult to concentrate on dramatic issues or become deeply involved with fictional characters. 
The most successful Imax films have been documentaries like ''Space Station 3D'' and ''Everest,'' special-effects films and travelogues designed to show off the medium's potential without too much distracting information. Disney's''Young Black Stallion,'' opening nationwide , joins the small pool of films that have dared to use Imax to tell a story. 
But it is a very small story stranded in a very large space. Based on a 1989 children's book by Walter and Steven Farley, the picture is a prequel to Walter Farley's ''Black Stallion,'' memorably filmed in 1979 by Carroll Ballard. 
In the North African desert shortly after World War II, an Arab girl, Neera (Biana G. Tamimi), becomes separated from the caravan that is taking her from her ruined home in the city to her grandfather's formerly regal estate in the wilds. She is befriended by the frisky young colt of the title, which not only leads her to her grandfather's home but helps the family reclaim its lost greatness by winning a traditional high-stakes race against some neighboring tribal leaders. It is Neera of course who rides the young stallion to victory, scoring an anachronistic (but by now obligatory) feminist point. 
With its relative dearth of incident Jeanne Rosenberg's screenplay is ideally suited to the 45-minute length imposed by the Imax format. Most of the movie is rightly devoted to stunning landscapes (shot in Namibia and South Africa, rather than the north) in which sand dunes and mountains seem to extend forever. The amazing depth of field of the Imax image is highlighted by several shots that seem interpolated from regular 35-millimeter cameras: fine enough under most conditions but disappointingly flat when so much else is so highly dimensional. 
The Australian filmmaker Simon Wincer is a veteran of many children's adventure films, including ''Free Willy'' (1993), and he delivers a clean, straightforward product here. A bit of flavor is added by Richard Romanus, the actor best known as the silky apprentice godfather in ''Mean Streets,'' who here borrows Omar Sharif's accent and toothy smile to play the kindly grandfather. 
Still, it is supremely easy for the eye to wander away from the tiny exchanges of dialogue in the foreground to the towering wonders of nature in the background. The format has yet to find a director who can balance characters and landscape within the Imax frame, as Raoul Walsh did in the pioneering 65-millimeter wide-screen epic of 1930, ''The Big Trail,'' or David Lean with the Super Panavision 70 format of ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' 
Walsh and Lean found reflections of their protagonist's inner states in the landscapes that surrounded them, a metaphorical approach that turned mere spectacle into genuine epic. Imax is still waiting for its transformative figure.

‽
‽Cold Mountain‽,‽Were it not for a gruesomely violent battle sequence at the beginning, a smattering of profanity and an occasional glimpse of unclothed flesh, ''Cold Mountain'' might easily be mistaken for the product of an earlier era of movie-making. The film, freely adapted by Anthony Minghella from Charles Frazier's best-selling novel, is an episodic romance that begins like a war movie and ends like a western, and it requires an old-fashioned critical idiom to do it justice. It is, as my predecessor Bosley Crowther might have said, one heck of a classy picture. 
I mean this both as sincere praise and as a qualification of that praise. ''Cold Mountain,'' at once generous and self-congratulatory, full of lush scenery and large emotions, clearly longs for a home on the video store's classics shelf. To speed its passage, it arrives laden with the trappings of prefabricated cultural prestige, including a high-toned literary pedigree and a lustrous cast of past and future Oscar winners and nominees. The film, opening nationwide today, thus follows in what has become a Miramax holiday tradition of highly polished, and often lifeless, literary adaptations, including ''The English Patient'' (also directed by Mr. Minghella), ''The Cider House Rules'' and ''Chocolat.'' 
Fortunately, ''Cold Mountain,'' which stars Jude Law and Nicole Kidman as would-be lovers separated by the cruelty and privation of the American Civil War, distinguishes itself from such middlebrow conversation-stoppers. Its sober good taste is enlivened by large doses of intelligence and humor, and even a touch of authentic cinematic grandeur. 
By authentic I mean utterly artificial. Mr. Minghella, who can be overly solemn in pursuit of realism, is, thank goodness, also entranced by the beauty of exotic landscapes and the charisma of movie stars. Ms. Kidman, playing Ada Monroe, a citified preacher's daughter stranded in the remote hamlet of Cold Mountain, N.C., has never been lovelier, and her radiance at once challenges your disbelief and compels you to suspend it. Even dressed in cast-off men's clothes and struggling against the rigors of 19th-century rural life, she looks as if she had stepped from the pages of a glossy magazine, her eyebrows and cuticles painstakingly attended to. This incongruity adds to the movie's charm rather than dispelling it. 
And in nearly every particular -- including the soundtrack, which blends Gabriel Yared's lavish symphonic orchestration with Appalachian fiddle breakdowns and Deep-South Sacred Harp vocal harmonies -- the movie's elegant fakery improves on the book's stiff pretentiousness. The gothic landscape of Romania (beautifully photographed by John Seale) stands in for the hills and hollows of western North Carolina, and the plain country people who inhabit the novel's mock-folksy episodes are impersonated onscreen by a platoon of well-respected actors, many of them British, who drawl their vowels and clip their consonants into approximations of Southern American dialect. 
Mr. Law's accent is probably the most convincing, and his matinee-idol features are, for much of the movie, camouflaged by grime, fatigue and an unkempt beard. One peculiarity of ''Cold Mountain'' is that it is a love story in which the two romantic leads share little screen time and often seem to inhabit separate movies. In early flashbacks, Ada and Inman, Mr. Law's wry, taciturn character, trade flirtatious glances and share a rushed farewell kiss, but mostly they are apart, clinging to the dim prospect of reunion as a survival strategy. 
The story's pathos comes from the disproportionate intensity of their longing. They barely know each other, and their love is an attempt to conjure an idea of happiness in grim times. 
Inman, wounded in the battle of Fredericksburg, steps out of the window of a squalid Virginia military hospital and undertakes a long inland trek toward home. Ada, after the death of her father (Donald Sutherland), must contend with a harsh lifestyle for which her cosseted upbringing has left her unsuited. To help Ada manage her father's sprawling farm, her neighbor, Sally (Kathy Baker), sends over a no-nonsense spitfire named Ruby (Renée Zellweger), instigating a friendship that becomes the film's central relationship. 
Ms. Zellweger, wild-haired and ornery, clomps through the scenery like a migrant from Li'l Abner's Dogpatch. Her earthiness warms up ''Cold Mountain'' considerably, and her scenes with Ms. Kidman have a loose, improvisatory rhythm missing from much of the movie. They work together like a seasoned comedy team, and Mr. Minghella makes the most of their differences in temperament and appearance. 
While Ada grapples with farm work and the unwelcome attentions of Teague (Ray Winstone), an officer in the Home Guard who terrorizes the people of Cold Mountain in the name of the faltering Confederate cause, Inman slogs through a landscape populated by figures out of old murder ballads and tall tales. 
Mr. Law, a hint of mischief lingering around his tired eyes, meets up with a parade of Hollywood hillbillies, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi and Eileen Atkins. (Among the very few black people he sees is a silent, briefly glimpsed band of runaway slaves.) Alternating between these encounters and Ms. Kidman' s home-front stoicism, ''Cold Mountain'' unfolds in lyrical counterpoint. 
Its awkward beginning -- a jumble of flashbacks, voice-overs and confusing combat scenes -- reveals the structural challenge Mr. Minghella faced in adapting the novel, which seesaws between the present and the past and includes numerous digressions and side narratives. Imitating it too faithfully would have killed the film's fragile momentum, but Mr. Minghella, working with the matchlessly resourceful editor Walter Murch, has tightened Mr. Frazier's ungainly tale while preserving its epic capaciousness. 
The result is a mountain of honest, nourishing corn, a lavish evocation of simplicity that, for all its showy sophistication, has an appealing emotional directness. For all its sweep and scope and movie-star magic, ''Cold Mountain'' is studded with fine small moments and deft supporting performances, notably from Ms. Atkins, Ms. Portman and Brendan Gleeson, who plays Ruby's wayward, fiddle-playing father. 
The final assault on the heartstrings is marred only by the inevitable sex scene, a concession to modern sensibilities that makes you long for the old days of Production Code repression, when instead of a few minutes of peekaboo montage and heavy breathing, Inman and Ada would have consummated their love with a blown-out candle, a closed door, and a few wispy clouds suggestively passing across the moon. 
''Cold Mountain'' is rated R. It has graphic battle scenes, nudity and period-appropriate profanity.

‽Mona Lisa Smile‽,‽''You can bake your cake and eat it too!'' says the reassuring slogan that distills the comfy revisionist feminism informing ''Mona Lisa Smile.'' That slogan is repeated empathically enough to qualify as the defining mantra of a movie that pretends to be audacious. And the lurking duplicity in that loaded word ''bake'' (remember Hillary Rodham Clinton's sarcastic remarks about baking cookies?) winds up applying to the movie itself. Like ''Down With Love'' earlier this year, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' preaches disruptive female self-empowerment out of one side of its mouth while out of the other it invokes the dream of being swept up, up and away by Prince Charming. 
A miscast but irresistible Julia Roberts stars as Katherine Watson, a free-spirited Californian who moves East to teach at demure, snooty Wellesley College in 1953 and shakes up the place enough to be deemed subversive by the institution's hawk-eyed thought police. The insistence with which Katherine presses her mildly progressive agenda at the elite women's college makes her a kind of academic Erin Brockovich, or so the movie wants us to believe. And in her art history classes, which inspire the screenplay's most intelligent writing, she challenges her students to do more than simply identify paintings shown in slides. 
Why is an original van Gogh a work of art and a reproduction not? she asks. And where does a do-it-yourself, paint-by-numbers van Gogh fit into the scheme of things? The early 50's also brought the ascendance of Abstract Expressionism, and the appearance of a Jackson Pollock canvas on campus stirs up ripples of controversy. 
But Katherine's biggest boo-boo has nothing to do with notions of aesthetics. Arriving at Wellesley, she is appalled to discover that almost to a person, her brilliant, privileged students have no postgraduate ambitions beyond settling down with Mr. Right, having babies and baking sugar cakes for hubby. Her rebellion culminates with an indignant, heretical slide show of vintage magazine ads displaying perky, smiling Stepford wives reigning like queens in their immaculate kitchens. 
The movie, which opens nationally today, was directed by Mike Newell, whose popular films ''Four Weddings and a Funeral'' and ''Enchanted April'' tease you with the same glimmerings of something loftier before settling into a warm and fuzzy niche. Like his fellow Briton Richard Curtis (''Love, Actually,'' ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' ''Notting Hill'' and the screenplay of ''Four Weddings''), Mr. Newell is master of the feel-good ensemble piece whose shallowness is partly masked by the expertise of a high-toned cast. 
A star-watcher's guilty pleasure, the movie rubs together three of Hollywood's brightest younger stars -- Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal, all playing Wellesley seniors -- and throws in an appealing newcomer, Ginnifer Goodwin. Topping off this marshmallow sundae are vivid turns by Marcia Gay Harden as the world's prissiest (and weepiest) teacher of elocution and poise, Juliet Stevenson as the discreetly lesbian school nurse with progressive ideas about birth control, and that empress of hauteur, Marian Seldes, playing the intransigently starchy college president. Dominic West, as a carnivorous-eyed professor of Italian who sleeps with his students, gives the movie its requisite shot of testosterone. 
If Ms. Roberts is the undisputed star of ''Mona Lisa Smile,'' she graciously allows her acolytes plenty of opportunity to sparkle. Each plays a specific type. Ms. Dunst is Betty Warren, a vicious, overprivileged alpha girl and archtraditionalist hellbent on marriage to a louse, who attacks Katherine in the college newspaper. 
Ms. Stiles is Joan Brandwyn, Betty's best friend and Katherine's protégée, who finds herself torn between marriage and Yale Law School. Ms. Gyllenhaal, who almost steals the movie, plays Giselle Levy, the wised-up class rebel who sleeps around and almost loses her bearings. Ms. Goodwin's character, Connie Baker, is the house wallflower (and chief victim of Betty's cruelty) who can't believe it when a boy asks her out. Although the four are stock figures, the talented actresses shade their stereotypes enough to lend them as much humanity as the formulaic screenplay (by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal) permits. 
As the story follows Katherine through her first year at Wellesley, there are enough reversals to keep you guessing which characters will escape this upscale cuckoo's nest, although it's not very hard to figure out. Although Ms. Roberts is playing a grown-up academic, the aura she wafts is as ingenuous as ever. She is still the wide-eyed but feisty people's princess and angel of common sense whose high-beam smile can melt steel. Think of ''Mona Lisa Smile'' as ''The Best of Everything'' meets ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.'' Or better yet, ''Goodbye, Little Miss Chips.'' 
''Mona Lisa Smile'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for strong language and mild sexual situations.

‽
‽The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King‽,‽After the galloping intelligence displayed in the first two parts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, your fear may be that the director, Peter Jackson, would become cautious and unimaginative with the last episode, ''The Return of the King.'' Look at what ''The Matrix'' did to the Wachowski brothers; the last two were like action movies made for CNBC. 
But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His ''King'' is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. A sequence in which a number of signal fires are lighted on a stretch of mountain ranges simultaneously is a towering moment; it has the majesty that every studio's opening logo shot sprains itself striving to achieve. 
Mr. Jackson does take his time, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, ''The Two Towers,'' with its pounding and operatic martial fury -- a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging -- can be found here. 
Yet by its end ''King'' glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the ''Rings'' movies, with an epilogue that is tinged with regret. It's been a long time since a commercially oriented film with the scale of ''King'' ended with such an enduring and heartbreaking coda: ''You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.'' It's an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale pop action film. 
The closest thing to a recap of the previous films, ''The Fellowship of the Rings'' and ''Towers,'' this picture supplies is showing Gollum (Andy Serkis) as a regular hobbit -- Smeagol -- before he was subsumed by his appetite for the glittering One Ring and transformed into a larval creature that looks like the worm Smeagol is shown putting on a hook. It's the One Ring that the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) has to transport to Mordor and destroy it there. 
The collaboration of actor and director -- Mr. Serkis and Mr. Jackson -- for Gollum is a frighteningly believable realization of computer imagery as performer. Gollum, whose phyllo-dough skin still masks his abrupt and fully felt changes of heart, is as emotionally rich a creation as any actor's work this year. A dialogue he has with his reflection in a pond courses with invective and self-disgust. All of Mr. Jackson's glib, funny pranks in ''Heavenly Creatures'' and ''The Frighteners'' -- in which we were never supposed to be sure what was going on -- prepared him for a dramatic application of those techniques here. (He also employs his haunted-house dexterity in a formidable sequence with a giant spider.) 
Gollum's push-pull, divided between his hunger for the ring and his fears, makes him the most tragic figure in the movie. He preys on Frodo's weakened spirit, looking for the moment he can get the ring away and kill them both. The cursed ring pecks away at Frodo's humanity, as Gollum hammers away at the hobbit's remaining panes of will. The only thing keeping the wizened yet infantile goblin at bay is Frodo's loyal ally and sworn protector, Sam (Sean Astin). By making Gollum as integral a part of this tableau as Frodo and Sam, not only is there an important plot point at stake, but the movie is also frosted with misery. 
That mournful note echoes as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and his forces ready for their assault on Sauron's forces, the orcs. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, realizes that Frodo and Sam are on a suicide mission: ''There never was much hope. Just a false hope.'' Sir Ian's eyes move slowly, filled with mystery and pain. 
There is a sacrificial cast to the entire endeavor. The dwarf warrior Gimli thrives on this fatalistic bent, and is given a wry heedlessness by John Rhys-Davies; his charm-offense basso rumble is also the voice of the lord of the forest, Treebeard. The pitilessly sure elf warrior Legolas (Orlando Bloom, whose physical élan fills out the role) observes ''a sleepless malice'' watching over them. The hobbit Pippin has a much bigger role in this battle, and Billy Boyd is up to it, allowing Pippin to mature. 
Aragorn has the slinky swagger and dreamy stubble that make him look like a legend created by Tolkien, Sam Shepard and Ralph Lauren. Fortunately Mr. Mortensen also has a touch of modesty as an actor, which allows him to take up space as if he belongs in the center of the frame rather than battling the other performers for it. 
Pippin's pal, Merry (Dominic Monaghan), joins the fight, too, pulled along by Eowyn (Miranda Otto, touchingly ferocious). Ms. Otto stakes a worthy claim for every moment of screen time, while poor Liv Tyler, as the elf princess Arwen, is limited to dialogue that sounds like a spoken portion of a Spinal Tap album. Cate Blanchett's Galadriel hardly appears at all, and Hugo Weaving, as the elf lord Elrond, arrives just in time to answer a trivia question. (Who is the best-known Australian actor to appear in the ''Matrix'' and ''Rings'' movies?) 
The actors all look older than they did in ''Fellowship,'' and it fits the strategy of employing the same cast over an extended period for the films. This decision adds fresh dimension to the lingering sadness, as we can see some of the bloom worn out of their flesh and sadder, reddened eyes on all of them. 
Their battle weariness is appropriate given whom they are up against. The orcs and their terrifying behemoths of burden have a surreal confidence in victory; they even turn the phrase ''Release the prisoners'' into a threat. Sauron's misshapen foot soldiers and their collection of mutated animal freaks look as if they've crawled out of the sewers of Love Canal looking for summer work. 
''King,'' which opens round the country tomorrow, features more prognostication and exposition than its predecessors. Yet despite all of the setups required, Mr. Jackson maintains tension. In ''Towers,'' the director and his fellow screenwriters, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, secured a spiritual fidelity to the novel. In ''King'' they manage that and far more; the last third is especially condensed, and Aragon's role in the last battle is fleshed out. But the Tolkien search for purity is central to their ''King,'' too. And the movie isn't as exclusionary as the books' implicit Christian forcefulness, which made Middle Earth a re-creation of the Crusades. 
''King'' is the product of impressive craft and energy. The ''sleepless malice'' is aligned with controlled chaos; the sizable exertion of concentration from Mr. Jackson is multiplied by his ''Rings'' team, including his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie; composer, Howard Shore; production designer, Grant Major; and the battalion of other artisans responsible for the costumes, makeup and special effects. 
It is evident that the grip of ''The Return of the King'' on Mr. Jackson is not unlike the grasp the One Ring exerts over Frodo: it's tough for him to let go, which is why the picture feels as if it has an excess of endings. But he can be forgiven. Why not allow him one last extra bow? 
''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' is rated PG-13 for a stunning mastery of violence and intense scenes of bloodletting.

‽Something's Gotta Give‽,‽About two-thirds of the way through ''Something's Gotta Give,'' Diane Keaton bursts into tears. Her character, a divorced, middle-aged playwright named Erica Barry, has seen her quiet life of professional fulfillment and romantic disappointment unexpectedly disrupted by love and then, in short order, by heartbreak. Erica's sobs, sniffles and wails seem endless and uncontrollable, expressing every conceivable combination of hurt, humiliation and anger. Her crying jag, which seems to last for several months, continues without interruption through a half-dozen cuts and scene changes, carrying Erica through nearly every room in her large, airy East Hampton beach house. 
But ''Something's Gotta Give,'' which opens nationwide today, is a comedy. At the sneak preview I attended last week, the harder Erica cried, the harder the audience laughed, which I might have found disturbing if I had not been laughing so helplessly myself. 
This mirth was not cruel or derisive; it was instead an odd but nonetheless apt measure of the audience's sympathy and affection for Erica and a tribute to Ms. Keaton's unparalleled comic skill. Nobody else working in movies today can make her own misery such a source of delight or make the spectacle of utter embarrassment look like a higher form of dignity. Erica is by turns prickly, indecisive, uptight, vulnerable, self-assured and skittish: traits Ms. Keaton blends into a performance that is at once entirely coherent and dizzyingly unpredictable. 
The smash hit play Erica eventually writes -- her delicious revenge on the man who caused her such pain -- is called ''A Woman to Love,'' which would have been a much better title for this unusually satisfying comic romance than the empty and generic one it has. Erica lifts the phrase from one of her two suitors, a smooth-faced, star-struck young doctor named Julian, played in tongue-in-cheek Ralph Bellamy deadpan by Keanu Reeves. The movie is built around the wonderful and entirely persuasive conceit that both Mr. Reeves and Jack Nicholson could find themselves hopelessly smitten with an intelligent and accomplished woman in her 50's. 
Mr. Nicholson plays Harry Sanborn, a rich, 62-year-old bachelor who has devoted his life to philosophy: the Playboy Philosophy, circa 1966. Harry prides himself on never having dated a woman over 30, and at the start of the movie his babe of the moment is Erica's daughter, Marin (Amanda Peet). 
Mr. Nicholson may not, strictly speaking, be playing himself, but he seems to have prepared for the role by studying a few decades' worth of interviews and magazine profiles celebrating his unapologetic libertinism. And if his casting is an obvious joke, it is nonetheless a good one, thanks to his devilish combination of high-spirited rakishness and old-school gallantry. 
After suffering a heart attack during a bit of hanky panky with Marin, Harry finds himself under Erica's reluctant care, stranded in her house, where the rules of bedroom farce are strictly enforced. Logy and disoriented, Harry stumbles into Erica's bedroom and sees her naked, an event that casts an awkward pall over their relationship as well as foreshadowing its eventual consummation. 
''Something's Gotta Give'' was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who has, from ''Private Benjamin'' to ''What Women Want,'' demonstrated a thorough, if not always breathtakingly original, flair for the conventions of mainstream quasi-feminist comedy. She and Ms. Keaton have worked together before, in the yuppie crisis comedy ''Baby Boom'' and the retrofitted ''Father of the Bride'' pictures, in which Ms. Keaton was unimaginatively relegated to the role of Steve Martin's patient wife and obliging straight man. 
''Something's Gotta Give,'' true to form, does not really depart from the genial, sentimental formulas of its genre. Some of the jokes are flat, and some scenes that should sparkle with screwball effervescence sputter instead. But what Ms. Meyers lacks in inventiveness she makes up for in generosity, to the actors and therefore to the audience. 
Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Keaton -- last seen together, in rather different circumstances, as Eugene O'Neill and Louise Bryant in Warren Beatty's ''Reds'' -- spar with the freedom of professionals with nothing left to prove, and Mr. Nicholson has the gentlemanly grace to step aside and let Ms. Keaton claim the movie. She in turn brings out the best in everyone around her. Mr. Reeves, liberated from the Matrix and the burden of being the One, mocks his own mellow blandness but conveys his character's ardor for Erica without the slightest hint of facetiousness. 
Frances McDormand, as Erica's sister, a professor of women's studies, sidesteps the temptations of caricature and tosses off some of the movie's funniest lines. Ms. Peet, zany and appealing in an underwritten role, continues her steady, zigzagging growth into one of the most interesting (and, by this critic at least, often underestimated) young actresses around. If she keeps it up, she could be the next Diane Keaton. 
Which, as of this writing, is about the highest praise I can confer. After Erica's tears have dried, she and the audience are rewarded with a giddy, Lubitschean third act, which swirls through Manhattan and the Caribbean before touching down -- but of course -- in Paris for a sweetly predictable denouement. If Erica's distress makes you laugh, her richly deserved joy might just bring a tear to your eye. 
Julian had it right: she is a woman to love. ''You're incredibly sexy,'' he says to her at one point. 
''I swear to God, I'm not,'' she replies. 
I swear to God, she's wrong. 
''Something's Gotta Give'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for nudity, profanity and other grown-up stuff.

‽
‽Stuck on You‽,‽It's probably fitting that portions of the new Farrelly Brothers' chewy but minor comedy, ''Stuck on You,'' are set during the winter in a resort town -- Martha's Vineyard -- like their first picture out of the toboggan chute, ''Dumb and Dumber.'' Both movies seem to come out of a taste-free zone partially inspired by Rankin/Bass, the animation studio responsible for the holiday stop-motion, self-pity classics like ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' 
Bobby and Peter Farrelly's creations -- this time it's the conjoined 32-year-old twins Bob and Walt Tenor -- reside happily in a landscape like the Island of Misfit Toys. For the Tenor boys, it's the small town where they run a thriving diner, Quickee Burger, in which they guarantee to get the food to the table in three minutes, no matter how big the order. 
With ''Stuck on You,'' which opens nationwide today, the Farrelly Brothers have a big, steaming order to deliver. They must compete with the legacy of their own bad taste, for which they compensate with a quality that some may find even more repellent -- sentimentality. It's a much funnier movie than the trailer would lead you to believe; it would almost have to be. But it is just not as consistent as their previous trash wallows. 
Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear) are country mouse and city mouse who are actually joined at the hip; the directors bring the double-sided motif closer together than ever before. Bob is happy slinging burgers, while Walt aspires to be an actor -- a successful one, that is. He's already the biggest thing in their hometown, where he stars as Truman Capote in the one-man show ''Tru.'' Some of the funniest stuff in the movie involves the comparison of Robert Morse's version to Walt's. It's a little more amusing than Bob's having a panic attack at the prospect of having to be onstage, though badly hidden, with his brother. Yet Walt is the kind of ambitious comet who might be played by Mr. Morse -- he's an audacious operator who's gifted at charming everyone. 
While Walt succeeds without really trying, Bob hides under his bangs and maintains an e-mail relationship with a girl he's been writing to for three years but hasn't met. When Walt decides it's time for the brothers to move to Hollywood -- ''I think I got the chops,'' he says of his motivation, an utterly absurd situation that's treated seriously -- he convinces his younger brother by saying it's a chance for Bob to see his Internet honey, May Fong (Wen Yann Shih), in person. 
Walt has less of their liver than Bob -- it's how the movie explains why a separation surgery would be risky, since there's only a 50-50 chance that Walt would survive. (It's also the excuse for Walt looking older; Mr. Kinnear is seven years Mr. Damon's senior, but that doesn't explain why he seems to be wearing Jeff Daniels's hair from ''Dumb and Dumber.'') 
But after 32 years the Tenors have become a marvelously functioning machine by necessity and because of affection. (We get a flashback of their athletic achievements that includes a cameo by the Dolphins running back Ricky Williams as their high school football coach.) 
Walt's gargantuan optimism gives the movie a soul; it needs one since it barely has a look. The scenes set in the Hollywood residential hotel where they live look even faker than Walt's hair. On the other hand, the twins' relocation to Los Angeles gives the Farrellys a chance for the most glamorous shot of their careers, a camera move that starts with a palm-frond-view of Hollywood Boulevard and descends to the street. 
For the unshakable Tenors, this is their arrival in dreamland -- they're oblivious to the sleaze -- and it's highlighted by another Capote reference: Andy Williams's swoony warbling of ''Moon River,'' from ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' (Other equally corny songs mixed in are a Dolby-in-selected-theaters version of ''Moonlight Feels Right,'' as well as ''Wild Horses'' and, as the boys work their grill, ''Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire.'') 
The twins' curvy, swerve-on neighbor April (Eva Mendes, charming though she didn't need to lose so much weight for the part) vibes with Walt's conquering attitude, even though she's a few lumens short of a porchlight. And he gets an agent, Morty O'Reilly (Seymour Cassel), who's so out-of-touch that he probably thinks the ''Happy Days'' episodes on Nick at Nite are first-run; his eyeglass frames are big enough to carry those shows. 
Walt's dynamism leads to a run-in with Cher (as herself), who wants to use him -- that is, them -- to get out of a network television commitment. In order to sabotage the deal she hires Walt as a co-star to play her partner in a crime-stopper series, which also seems to have been lifted from the same 70's era that Morty is stuck in. 
Walt plays a wise-cracking police scientist and Cher is a tough-talking lawyer, sporting Solid Gold dancer ensembles similar to the outfits she wore in 1987's ''Suspect,'' where she really did star as a lawyer. (She earns a good sport award here, to go with her Oscar.) The laughs come with the handling of Bob on the set, rather than the attempts to parody a show that might still have a place on CBS -- after all, they did recently retire ''Matlock.'' 
The Farrellys, working with the writers Charles B. Wessler and Bennett Yellin, are at their best when they pair the movie's optimism with opportunism. The directors gleefully sink to wielding the producing studio, Fox, as de facto product placement, along with several other back-shelf products that you may have forgotten about. 
And there is a last cameo that returns a performer who also has forgotten roots -- in musical theater -- to the stage for the big finale. The one thing that connects all of the Farrellys' movies is inclusion, and eventually -- some might cringe and say inevitably -- ''Stuck on You'' does so as well. The story of the Tenors finally alights on a passage that could be from ''The Wizard of Oz'' -- there's no place like home. 
''Stuck on You'' is rated PG-13, (Parents strongly cautioned), which means that it gets away with a mountain range of undernourished double-entendres, strong language, tricky conjoined twin fistfights and alcohol consumption.

‽Love Don't Cost a Thing‽,‽''Love Don't Cost a Thing,'' proclaims the title of Troy Beyer's film, but affection is a little more expensive. The going rate here is $1,500 for two weeks, which is what Alvin Johnson (Nick Cannon), a geeky high school student, indirectly pays Paris Morgan (Christina Milian), the most popular girl in his Long Beach, Calif., high school class, to pretend to be his girlfriend for two weeks. 
Alvin, who wears a circa 1972 Afro and clothes that seem to have been gathered from a Robert Hall sample sale, is an accomplished amateur engineer, a finalist in a national contest sponsored by a car company for a new engine design. But knowing your way around a camshaft doesn't count for much in the buppie environment of Alvin's school, where being a star on the basketball team is the one sure way to attract female attention. 
Alvin lures Paris into his debt when she crashes her mother's car, and only Alvin has the technical expertise and the $1,500 in cash needed to make the repairs before Mom gets back from a vacation. Alvin restores the car, and Paris keeps her part of the bargain. She asks Alvin to hang out with her cool friends, takes him shopping for Sean John clothes (a blatant commercial plug) and invites him to parties where his nerd friends are turned away at the door. 
Alvin does grow more popular, and Paris, chastened for her snobbery, starts to fall for him. But in his rush to acceptance he has left his old friends behind, a classic movie mistake, since naturally he will need his pals to get him out of the scrape he will inevitably encounter in the final reel of the film, which opens today nationwide. 
If all this seems slightly more familiar than usual even for a formula teenage film, it may be because the screenplay (by Michael Swerdlick) had already been used for the 1987 film ''Can't Buy Me Love,'' starring Patrick Dempsey. Ms. Beyer, the director (and sometimes actor, in films that include ''B*A*P*S'' and ''John Q''), has reworked the screenplay with some African-American references, though the material remains essentially unchanged. 
Lessons are learned, including the importance of loyalty, the need to see through appearances to essences and the wonder-working properties of blindly believing in yourself. But there are unlearned lessons, too, including the one about the propriety of a teenage girl's entering into a relationship that, whether or not sex is required, amounts to soft-core prostitution. 
The cast is uniformly high spirited and attractive, and Ms. Beyer's direction, apart from a few over-weighted Wellesian camera angles, is functional. 
''Love Don't Cost a Thing'' has been rated PG-13 (''Parents strongly cautioned''). It contains some saucy dialogue and a cheerleading routine that would steam up glasses on the old 42nd Street. 
‽
‽The Last Samurai‽,‽There is probably no director more obsessed with the complexity of patriotism -- an unusual subject to plumb in mainstream films -- than Edward Zwick, who is driven to question the imperatives of an America that his protagonists both love and detest. His latest movie, ''The Last Samurai,'' falls squarely into the realm of the previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, ''Glory,'' ''Courage Under Fire'' and ''The Siege.'' 
And I do mean squarely. ''Samurai'' is a mythic western that combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in Japanese culture: John Ford's ''Lost in Translation.'' It depicts phalanxes of troops moving with deliberate, terrifying fervor across the very wide screen. 
And this time Tom Cruise, the can-do idol of millions, uses his polished-chrome smile mirthlessly. At least for the first hour, his grin looks like a faded tattoo. The uneven ''Samurai'' is a can-do movie that's far more effective at communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more intimate ones. 
Mr. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned-out former Army officer and Indian fighter. Having survived Custer's Last Stand in 1876, he is now a commercial sideshow prop, demonstrating the newest Winchester rifle. As Algren lumbers through the clichés he's hired to recite before blasting away at targets -- though the whiskey oozing from his pores probably makes him more of a danger than the weapon -- a sudden ember of regret flames in this ex-soldier's eyes. He goes off the script, reciting the horrors of a campaign in which he and his troops slaughtered innocents. 
Algren looks so wasted and beleaguered that the biggest question is not whether he'll wing an audience member with a stray shot, but whether he can bear up under the dense, cast-iron plot. After being bounced by the Winchester folks, Algren is hired by his former commander, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn, playing a salamanderlike ancestor of all the sleazy characters he's ever portrayed). Bagley wants Algren to travel with him to Tokyo and train Japanese soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles. The Meiji emperor is ready to accept the ways of the West; he's actually being pressured to by American business interests. 
Once in Japan, Algren is forced to send his nervous, underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against an enemy of the emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Despite the imperial army's modern weapons, Katsumoto and his men sweep in with ferocity and wield their arms of the past -- swords and spears -- with lethal effectiveness. The cinematographer, John Toll, films their arrival through a thick fog in a forest, as if Katsumoto's men were ghosts from the recent past out to rob Algren's troops of their backbones -- and their lives. 
In their ritual armor, Katsumoto's men make quick work of their foes; there's tragicomic relief as Algren's conscripted farmers tremble while trying to load their guns. When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto's second in command, he's captured by the invaders and, even more bewildering, cared for by Katsumoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren murdered. 
It's a complicated story, and Mr. Zwick is complicated, too: he loves arrogance slapped out of its self-regard. Algren is full of himself, even though he's conceived as a man who was second tenor to a legend; he knew and despised Custer. Looking fashionably distressed, with slightly puffy, red-rimmed eyes that at the very least suggest that he's survived a grueling press junket, Mr. Cruise has a worn cockiness. His aw-shucks virility is a little wilted, if not mildewed, around the edges: a kind of reverse narcissism, since Algren is proud of his dissolution (though Mr. Cruise's good-boy posture works for a man reared under the disciplinary rigors of the military). 
Although at times Mr. Cruise comes off as too contemporary for the 19th century -- at one point, he seems to be waiting for a cellphone call to confirm his terms for a cover of Details magazine -- this displacement fits better when he becomes a prisoner. Algren appears to be reacting to this strange new world through sounds; nothing he's hearing makes any sense to him. He's a mangy gaijin that Edgar Rice Burroughs might have invented, though James Clavell got there eventually. 
The film includes notable performances by actors not drafted to shoulder the burden of the entire production. Billy Connolly, emanating a gamy, sly menace that he's rarely suggested before, plays Algren's former sergeant at arms, Zebulon Gant. Gant, used to propping up his old friend and superior officer, joins Algren in the journey to Japan. Mr. Connolly's loose, hostile vivacity registers so clearly that it's obvious we won't be seeing very much of him. But this is crackling, rigorous comic work; he doesn't have to present the face of tragedy. 
The far more weighted and daring acting comes from Mr. Watanabe, as Katsumoto. Probably best known outside of Japan as the reedy, restless sidekick in the gourmand classic ''Tampopo,'' Mr. Watanabe has filled out physically and spiritually. The formality he brings to Katsumoto is hard-won, especially when he's having pointedly thoughtful conversations with Algren that sound more like translations of ideograms than actual dialogue. 
The film never really explains how or why this resolute, isolated samurai learned to speak English better than the emperor. His fluency doesn't quite make sense, though it gives the movie some needed mystique. It plays better than the inexorable pull of romance, drawing Taka and Algren together. 
''The Last Samurai,'' which Mr. Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz wrote with John Logan, from a story by Mr. Logan, super-glues together a host of contradictions. Unfortunately, as dramatized, they function as conventions that are older than the story the film is weaving. The movie, which opens nationwide today, is most watchable during the majestic brutality of the battle sequences. This is not only because of the handsome staging, but also because the keywords sacrifice and honor are evoked with verve and simplicity, more so than in the ''exchange of idea'' chats between Algren and Katsumoto, which sound like statements being read into the Congressional Record by Nathaniel Hawthorne. 
Mr. Zwick has absorbed the lethal agility of Akira Kurosawa; what registers just as powerfully as the sureness of the combatants is the ugly futility of the battles themselves. When the film sets up the lessons that Algren has to learn, the hero is not really a fish out of water; he's more like a big fish in a dry pond, picking up a lesson in Eastern deportment and philosophy a step away from the ''wax-on, wax-off'' curriculum of ''The Karate Kid.'' In those scenes presaging his Eastern conversion, Algren can't suppress his eagerness to learn, picking up the ways of the sword and the Samurai code of Bushido with an alacrity that's mandated for movie stars: flash-card education. 
The film's title evokes James Fenimore Cooper, though he had enough perspective not to make a white man ''the last'' in his novel. Even though ''The Last Samurai'' opts for Japan's cultural differences, all of the unmentioned hardships of a feudal society notwithstanding, the remaining honorable native here is an American. Is that a veiled way of saying that Japan's old ways were doomed after all? 
''The Last Samurai'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, including enough ritualistic bloodletting for a week on the History Channel; alcohol use; strong language; and a chaste hint of sexuality.

‽
‽Honey‽,‽''Honey,'' an upbeat little hip-hop fable that opens today nationwide, is not the kind of movie that will impress anyone with its originality. It may remind you, at various times, of ''Flashdance,'' ''Fame,'' ''8 Mile'' and ''Drumline,'' a list that could be expanded to include dozens of other movies about plucky young artists striving to make it big while remaining true to themselves and connected to the people around them. In this case the heroine is a cheerful, driven young dancer named Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba), who longs to break out of the hip-hop club scene into the world of music videos (from which the movie's director, Bille Woodruff, has emerged to make his feature-film debut). 
Honey's path is strewn with some familiar impediments, including a disapproving mother (Lonette McKee) who thinks her daughter's talents would be better suited to ballet, and a video director (David Moscow) whose interest in Honey may extend beyond those talents. But the movie is as sunny and high-spirited as Honey herself, and you don't worry too hard or too long about her or anyone else in it. 
Her ambition is balanced by civic-mindedness, and her self-confidence never gets the better of her easy generosity. In addition to bartending and working the cash register at a record store, she teaches hip-hop dancing at a community center in her Bronx neighborhood and tries to steer her young protégés -- in particular a troubled, gifted young man named Benny (Lil' Romeo, who shows some real promise as an actor) -- away from the clutches of the local drug dealer. 
Her ally and love interest is Chaz (Mekhi Phifer), a handsome barber who represents -- as Ice Cube did in ''Barbershop'' -- the values of hard work and community responsibility. While Chaz has no serious rival for Honey's affections (though she plays hard-to-get for a while), the movie does hint at a conflict between those values and the shallow, seductive glitter of show business. But Ms. Alba, lithe and charming though she is, is also too blandly perky to register much in the way of emotional conflict. And the script, by Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson, while heavy on incident and superficial complication, shies away from anything like real drama. 
What the movie offers instead -- in addition to frequent shots of Ms. Alba's bellybutton -- is a soundtrack bursting with well-chosen beats and a few cameos by real rap stars, including Jadakiss, Ginuwine and Missy Elliott. (Ms. Elliott surely deserves a movie of her own.) The kinetic energy of the music keeps this picture moving, and the presence of these stars gives it glamour and credibility, which, to fans like Honey and her friends, amount to the same thing. 
The ease with which Honey moves between the streets of the Bronx and the glittering whirl of the music industry reflects the current self-image of hip-hop itself, with its aggressive celebration of upward mobility and its simultaneous embrace of democratic, street-level authenticity. ''Honey'' brings out the wholesome, affirmative side of the hip-hop aesthetic without being overly preachy, and it offers a winningly utopian view of show-business success without real costs or compromises. 
''Honey'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and drug references, as well as a lot of dancing that is sexy without being overtly sexual.

‽
‽Bad Santa‽,‽Somebody needed to make a comedy out of all the holiday season hostility that goes up this time of year along with the decorations, and the light-fingered director Terry Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for the task. Their new film, ''Bad Santa,'' takes all the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. 
Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who is annually roused from sleeping one off in that most wonderful time of the year by his partner, Marcus (Tony Cox), a dwarf. Willie is a department store Santa, and Marcus plays his elf. As he does so, Marcus also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve it of valuable merchandise. On this tour they have ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. 
Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary ''Crumb'' and the his fiction-film debut, ''Ghost World,'' both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. ''Santa,'' which opens nationwide today, falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie Stokes anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot. A bar argument that nearly escalates into a particularly invasive fight in the parking lot is one funny example of Willie's talent. 
Mr. Thornton's performance is close to the surly distemper he showed in ''Tombstone'' as the round-faced, bratty gambler who simply couldn't stop erupting with childish sarcasm. Despite the long, gaunt face he's developed since then, suggesting an eloquence ennobled by silence, Mr. Thornton is much better and far more interesting as a compulsive talker with a bad taste in his mouth, a sensation he seems compelled to share with anyone within spraying distance. 
In the similarly themed 1998 comedy ''Scrooged,'' Bill Murray gave a prodigious performance, and that film might have been a minor classic if the direction hadn't been so bombastic. Mr. Murray was slated to star in ''Santa''; like him, Mr. Thornton is an ace at playing cantankerous, mouthy jerks in love with the sound of their own voices, men who lack the restraint or sense of shame to keep their dissatisfaction to themselves. 
Mr. Cox has the trickier task, playing someone who is half enabler, half-manipulator. But he manages to balance the roles while adding hints of devilish masochism: he knows why he hangs with Willie. 
Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton it functions as a kind of star chemistry; as Santa, Willie ladles his acid sarcasm onto the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne. He's the kind of minimum-wage jackal who's responsible for thousands of hours of therapy for his victims. 
Mr. Thornton used a bit of this wincing, twitching magnetic perversity in his turn as the James Carville-like adviser in ''Primary Colors.'' But now it's under the main spotlight. It's what brings other unfortunates into his orbit, like the clear-eyed sprite Sue (Lauren Graham), who has a thing for bad-girl activity that would put her on most Santas' naughty lists. Then again, there's probably no living person who could do enough dirt to end up on Willie's naughty list. 
Like many films by the Coen brothers -- they're executive producers and came up with premise -- the world of ''Bad Santa'' seems to be peopled by inhabitants of the lower depths, like the skittish and gullible department store manager (John Ritter, in his last role), who is extorted by Marcus into keeping Willie on the payroll. There's also the wily security chief (Bernie Mac, who looks like a suburban king in his Stetson and Western-accented polyesters) who isn't nearly as trusting or vulnerable. 
At the top of the unforgettable group of ''Bad Santa'' misfits is the chubby loner kid (Brett Kelly), whose runny nose and dead eyes mark him as schoolyard prey. (This boy could be a character right out of a comic by the ''Ghost World'' creator, Dan Clowes.) Willie treats the boy as prey: he moves into the kid's house while setting up the caper and drinking himself into brain atrophy. The scenes with the boy and with the child's oblivious grandmother (Cloris Leachman) aren't played for pathos so much as for shock. 
And Mr. Zwigoff shows the most comfort with this aspect of ''Santa.'' When it comes to the comedy, his brand of lingering deadpan pauses -- the perfect screen realization of underground comics -- isn't quite appropriate. A more conventional, even pushy, director could generate much bigger laughs, just because he'd deliver them on schedule. But Mr. Zwigoff isn't built that way, and though the staging is a little soft, the rest of the movie falls into place. Someone without his slacker temperament would also emphasize the pathos, which he won't or can't do. The actors are assured enough as performers that they compensate for Mr. Zwigoff's overdeliberate quality. The whole ragged, hilarious package is what makes ''Bad Santa'' such a treat. 
''Bad Santa'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for behavior that would get even Santa kicked out of a county lock-up: odd violence, strong language, drinking and idiosyncratic sexuality. 
‽
‽The Missing‽,‽Apparently the only thing tougher than endurance on the frontier is sitting through a movie about endurance on the frontier -- at least that is the point ''The Missing'' seems determined to make. Amazingly, what it also seems to be saying is that nearly 50 years after John Ford's ''Searchers'' we have arrived at a point in film history when the movie industry can offer a less sophisticated version of the same material. 
Overly sensitive and disdainful of her tough life, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) longs to escape the grim cabin she shares with her healer mother, Maggie (Cate Blanchett), and little sister, Dot (Jenna Boyd), in New Mexico territory in the 1880's. But teenage Lilly gets away from home in a way she never bargained for: she is kidnapped by renegade Apaches who plan to sell her into slavery once they enter Mexico. 
And she suffers. Lilly is subjected to everything but a Senate confirmation hearing and an appearance on ''The O'Reilly Factor.'' But ''The Missing'' mutes the sexual paranoia that jerked John Wayne's face into a grimace in ''The Searchers,'' in which he was eaten alive by the possibility that his abducted niece had become involved with her captor. Despite torrents of brutality, much of it coming after Lilly's botched escape attempts, there is no danger of rape from the scrupulous villains in ''The Missing.'' (The kidnappers may be more naïve than their victims.) As a result this is a movie that exists only from the shoulders up. Just before Lilly is snatched away, Maggie's estranged father, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones), returns home, and there's already tension between Lilly and Maggie. The abduction forces Maggie to team with the father she reviles because she needs his help to track down Lilly. This situation is an intriguing way for the director, Ron Howard, to play to his chief strength and interests: the knotty and peculiar emotional crosscurrents that buffet families. 
This feels like a thoughtful attempt to give the depiction of home life some weight, a quality not evident in Mr. Howard's previous work. The steeliness that links Maggie, her father and Lilly are evident in their stubbornness and inability to communicate their simplest needs. The first 20 minutes or so of prologue provide a bare-bones melodrama unleavened by sentimentality, as the equally willful presences of Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Jones square off against each other. (There is a suggestion of sexual violence in Maggie's past after her father abandoned the family, though it is mentioned only briefly.) 
After the mission of ''The Missing'' begins, though, the movie starts to feel like Stephen King's ''Little House on the Prairie.'' The kidnappers' ringleader, the horribly scarred Chidin (Eric Schweig), is a cross-cultural menace: a brujo as adept at casting evil spells as he is at keeping his filthy band of brothers in line. 
His cruelty, which peaks in a horrifying scene that shows Lilly what her enslaved future holds, is explained in a bizarre subplot about freebooter American soldiers looting the home of slaughtered settlers. It threatens to offer political explanations for Chidin's rampage, but really only serves to extend the running time of the picture. (This section does feature a welcome appearance by Val Kilmer as a useless martinet Army officer.) 
As do a number of other movies this season, ''The Missing'' uses the power of mysticism to add a level of psychological import. But it seems only reminiscent of the austere nature-spirituality of ''The Last of the Mohicans'' and eventually provides just a flirtation with magic, which is a respite from the more salient plot points. 
Maggie and her father come to understand and respect each other, and eventually the bleakly beautiful cinematography rendered by Salvatore Totino blossoms into dappled sunlight, something John Ford would never have sunk to. Well, not that often, anyway. 
Mr. Howard's restlessness as a director is muted by his need to spell things out while bringing them to a rousing and well-manicured close. That worked to his advantage in ''Apollo 13,'' in which concentration, ambition and corniness meshed. But here, despite the performances he gets -- the young Ms. Boyd is as good and determined as the adults -- he seems to have something else on his mind, perhaps remembering ''The Alamo'' project he never got to make. 
''The Missing'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for extended displays of violence -- slaughter, skinning, stabbing -- but there is no sex.

‽
‽The Haunted Mansion‽,‽The Disney fright comedy ''The Haunted Mansion,'' starring Eddie Murphy in another of his put-upon dad roles, is an anomaly: no frights and no laughs. The price of the popcorn-and-drink combo at most theaters showing this film is scarier. 
Given its rejection of conventional staples like laughs or scares, ''Haunted Mansion'' is almost like a bit of Zen wisdom: When you can snatch the entertainment from my movie, grasshopper, it is time for you to leave. The director, Rob Minkoff, should do that, in another picture ground from a Disney theme-park attraction. It's clearly only a matter of time before ''Parking Lot: The Movie'' and ''People-Mover: The Motion Picture.'' Who's to say these films would not be more diverting than ''Mansion,'' which exists primarily to make ''Cat in the Hat'' seem a piece of beveled nuance by comparison. 
''Haunted Mansion'' does seem beveled, actually; about all it has going for it is John Myhre's production design and all the work that went into creating the title ''character,'' which is as expressive as most of the cast is allowed to be. The mansion, Gracey Manor, is occupied by a ghost, Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), who killed himself centuries ago in response to his lady love's suicide. 
Jim Evers (Mr. Murphy), a real estate agent, is summoned to the manor with his wife, Sara (Marsha Thomason); tough-girl daughter, Megan (Aree Davis); and arachnophobic son, Michael (Marc John Jefferies). And the breathtaking Sara has an amazing resemblance to the late lady of the manor; or, as Jim puts it, a ghost is trying to get jiggy with his wife. 
Mr. Murphy's current core audience -- the 4-to-11-year-olds taking a break from ''Even Stevens'' on television long enough to get to a theater -- was amused by such lines at the weekend screening I attended. The adults sat without responding for so long that I think they forgot why they were there. 
They may have gone because Mr. Murphy still has such audience rapport that he can create expectations, and he retains the reflexes of an entertainer. ''Mansion'' provides a reminder of those gifts, since it reteams Mr. Murphy with Terence Stamp, his co-star in the often funny ''Bowfinger.'' And since another Disney theme-park-attraction-turned-movie, ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' defied expectation and turned out to be so surprisingly good, this film promised possibilities. 
But it is finally a movie that doesn't really want to evoke reaction; it lacks even the cheesy fear quotient that a movie like ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' could dredge up. And Mr. Murphy is left to fall back on his mechanical sketch version of displaying terror, which only makes the picture seem even more insubstantial. As special guest apparitions, Wallace Shawn and Jennifer Tilly get a few chuckles, mostly by using their standard inflections to deliver the nonsensical lines. 
''Haunted Mansion'' does pose a few interesting philosophical questions: queries from the beyond, so to speak. For instance, do the gorgeous and talented African-American actresses, in seemingly inexhaustible supply, who are employed to shake their heads and frown as Mr. Murphy's wives, get upset because there isn't much else for them to do in the movies these days? Does Mr. Murphy wonder if there's a middle ground between family comedies and the forgettable action fare like ''Showtime'' and ''I Spy'' for him to parade his considerable talents? 
There's plenty of time to ponder such mysteries while watching ''Haunted Mansion,'' the film equivalent of the dark, boring period on a haunted house ride before the gondola crashes into another room filled with dirty mirrors. 
''Haunted Mansion'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild scares and because someone at the M.P.A.A. may have been frightened by the Nelly song playing over the end credits.

‽Timeline‽,‽The clumsy, wooden, screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel ''Timeline'' suggests a particularly wretched episode of ''Star Trek'' tricked out with fancy fireworks and weighed down with a score that grinds away like a cement mixer. The pyrotechnics, in which battling 14th-century soldiers catapult fireballs into each other's fortresses, may be diverting. But from the beginning, this fantasy of time travel, in which a group of contemporary archaeologists plunges through a wormhole in the time-space continuum to land in France in 1357, pounds you over the head with its noisy, ridiculous notions of medieval life. 
The movie, directed by Richard Donner, is so verbally stingy it feels as though it were written with a stopwatch. But that doesn't prevent it from lumbering on for just under two nearly intolerable hours. Now and then the interminable battles are suspended just long enough -- usually less than five seconds -- to shoehorn in a carefully staged, unsteamy smooch between one of the movie's two pairs of cardboard lovebirds. 
The more unlikely romance, between Andre (Gerard Butler), a bearded Scottish archaeologist and Lady Clare (Anna Friel), a 14th-century French aristocrat menaced by English soldiers, begins with the usual questions -- ''Are you married?'' ''No.'' ''Well, then are you 'with' anyone?'' -- and proceeds in a matter of minutes to snuggly commitment. Andre eventually has to make the ultimate Captain Kirk-worthy choice of remaining with his lady love in 1357 or returning to the 21st century. 
The other romance teams Chris (Paul Walker), the son of Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly), the chief archaeologist, with his dad's attractive, gung-ho protégé Kate (Frances O'Connor). With his pretty-boy face and talent-free acting, Mr. Walker, who became a star with ''The Fast and the Furious,'' resembles a throwback to the days when imitation Tab Hunters were tapped for potential stardom simply on the basis of their dimpled smiles and vacant, sparkly eyes. 
The demented brain behind the time machine, which can ''fax'' objects from one place to another and one time to another belongs to a ruthless scientist named Doniger (David Thewlis) who is determined to make history no matter the consequences. His treacherous spin doctor, Frank (Neal McDonough), is a glowering piece of duplicitous yuppie scum. The expedition is dispatched to retrieve the professor, who got stuck in the past. 
Unbeknownst to the travelers the device has not been perfected, and the chances of the party's safe return are dicey. Because ''Timeline,'' which opens nationally today, doesn't have a genuinely human moment, the travelers' fates are a matter of indifference. 
''Timeline'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a lot of stagy violence and some strong language.

‽
‽Gothika‽,‽In ''Gothika,'' a clammy new thriller that opens nationwide today, Halle Berry plays Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist at a Connecticut institution for the criminally insane. One of her patients is Chlöe (Penélope Cruz), a disheveled young woman who screeches and rants and claims that she is being sexually assaulted by the devil in her locked cell. One obvious symptom of Chlöe's illness, whatever it is, is a tendency to speak in lurid similes: ''He opened me up like a flower of pain,'' she says of her demonic attacker, and (about someone else), ''I sliced his adam's apple in half like a piece of fruit on a summer day.'' 
In that spirit you might say that this movie, directed by Mathieu Kassovitz from a script by Sebastian Gutierrez, is like a plastic houseplant that has been given too much water, or a wax apple that someone has tried to bake in a pie. It is a thoroughly synthetic confection, compounded of clichés drawn from a half-dozen genres and subgenres that for a while might almost persuade its audience, as it apparently convinced its makers, that it is something more. 
In the end, though, as the ghost-story clichés collide with the serial-killer clichés, and the women-behind-bars clichés give way to the wronged-women-seeking revenge clichés, the movie proves to be both too much and not enough: yet another slick, empty package of ersatz entertainment. 
After her frustrating session with Chlöe, Miranda saunters through the rest of her workday, oblivious to the sinister foreshadowings all around her. Mr. Gutierrez seems to have gotten some script advice from either Edward Bulwer-Lytton or Snoopy, since it is (perpetually) a dark and stormy night. The gloomy corridors of the Woodward correctional center are bathed in pale, bluish fluorescence, and the power is always on the verge of going out. 
Mr. Kassovitz and Matthew Libatique, the cinematographer, do an effective (if not terribly original) job of creating an atmosphere of dread, though the director is a little too fond of making the audience jump at nothing. The false scares are so numerous -- an umbrella popping open, a light going out, a barn owl flapping into the frame -- that after a while they diminish the impact of the really scary stuff, rather than heightening it. 
Still, for a while, ''Gothika'' will manage to quicken your pulse and keep you in a state of nervous anticipation. Driving home through torrential rain, Miranda sees a girl standing in the middle of the road. When Miranda tries to help her, the girl chatters and screams and then bursts into flame. The doctor awakens a few days later to find that she has become an inmate, having been locked up for murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton) -- who was also the director of the hospital -- with an ax, a crime she initially has no memory of committing. 
Her sort of kindly, sort of creepy therapist is Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.), a former colleague who had a crush on her and who now either wants to help her or is part of a conspiracy to drive her completely out of her mind. 
''I'm not deluded,'' Miranda insists, ''I'm possessed.'' The flaming girl continues to pursue her in that passive-aggressive way common to movie ghosts in the post-''Sixth Sense'' era, driven by an urgent need to communicate something and able to do so only by depositing maddeningly cryptic clues. The supernatural visitor writes the words ''Not Alone'' on fogged-up glass, in blood and, gruesomely, in the flesh of Miranda's arm. What she means is ''I was the victim of a homicidal maniac, and I need you to help me uncover his horrible crimes,'' but she lacks either the space or the spelling ability to say so outright. 
And I certainly will not spell out for you what you will, before too long, figure out for yourself, at which point all suspense and intrigue will evaporate. About two-thirds of the way through the screening I attended, the startled gasps were replaced by laughter, as ''Gothika'' began its headlong descent into incoherence. If I had left after an hour, I might have taken the film for a clever, if somewhat glib, exercise in terror, with Ms. Berry showing the appropriate mixture of helplessness and grit, and Mr. Downey adding a gleam of raffish intelligence. But of course I would have been deluded. 
''Gothika'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity, gory violence and strong language.

‽Suspect Zero‽,‽Finally, a serial-killer movie so preposterous, so garnished with accidental laugh lines and absent essential narrative logic it may actually put a permanent kibosh on this tediously overworked crime subgenre. Here's hoping, at any rate. Directed with self-conscious hothouse flair by E. Elias Merhige, from a puzzler of a screenplay credited to Zak Penn and Billy Ray, ''Suspect Zero,'' which opens nationwide today, involves a serial killer who's doing away with other serial killers and the disgraced F.B.I. agent who refuses to let this meta-murder madness go unpunished. Think ''Seven'' minus the talent. 
Soon after the agent, Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart), lands in the F.B.I.'s sleepy Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cactuses and sand. One thing leads to another, leads to a few more corpses and a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths. 
Aided by his reluctant partner (Carrie-Anne Moss) and some meager tactical support (played by, among others, the always valuable character actor Harry Lennix), Mackelway tracks O'Ryan, trying to discover what connects him to the bodies cluttering up the morgue. Because O'Ryan scatters the trail with clues as big as bread crumbs, it soon appears that the hunter and the hunted may be on the same horrific page even if the director and the screenwriters are not. 
Stuff happens, mostly by fits and starts. Children go missing, the venerable director and screenwriter Robert Towne (''Chinatown'') pops in for an amusing unbilled cameo, and dread seeps into the scenery only to be sucked into the vacuum of the plot. Mr. Merhige -- whose previous features are the sui generis cult item ''Begotten'' and ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' a fictional gloss on the making of F. W. Murnau's silent classic ''Nosferatu'' -- has a sense of the macabre and an eye for outré detail. But his grasp on genre niceties is less than firm, or perhaps he's just not interested in sticking to the straight and narrow. Whatever the case, Mr. Merhige routinely wanders away from the absurd main story to doodle in its margins, where he conjures up ghostly silhouettes, anguished camera angles and a derelict landscape washed in blood red. 
Despite the gothic filigree and Mr. Merhige's strained attempt to wed shivers with high-art allusions and a few empty political gestures (think Leatherface meets Marcel Duchamp under a wind-snapped American flag), ''Suspect Zero'' doesn't take long to collapse under the weight of its ridiculous conceit and the depressing specter of countless dead. Even draped in aesthetic pretension, exploitative schlock is still exploitative schlock. 
What it all means and how it adds up is, in the end, distinctly less interesting than how and why this half-baked project attracted movie-industry power hitters like Paula Wagner, the film's co-producer and Tom Cruise's production partner; Mr. Ray, who directed last year's acclaimed independent film ''Shattered Glass''; and Mr. Kingsley and Ms. Moss, both of whom do much more for ''Suspect Zero'' than it does for them. 
''Suspect Zero''' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes gruesome, often realistic-looking violence.

‽
‽Hero‽,‽In ''Hero,'' an ambitious period epic about the birth of the first Chinese empire, warriors fly through the air like birds of prey, their swords cutting through enemies and lovers alike. Set during the third century B.C., the story of an assassination plot against a powerful king unfolds with such dazzling bursts of color and blurs of furious action it might be easy to miss the nationalistic message tucked amid the visual enchantments. Roll over, Chairman Mao, and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool. 
And now this birth of an empire also comes with the imprimatur of Quentin Tarantino. The reigning king of Amerasian cinema, Mr. Tarantino has lent his name to ''Hero'' (it looms above the title), a bit of commercial calculation no doubt meant to seduce the director's fans, some of whom have probably already watched the 2002 movie on imported DVD's. 
Mr. Tarantino's name is a nice touch, but the real auteur here is the Chinese director Zhang Yimou, who until now has been known for far more modestly scaled features such as ''Raise the Red Lantern'' and ''The Story of Qiu Ju.'' ''Hero,'' which opens nationwide today, shows Mr. Zhang working in a new genre and on a new scale, and handling the demands of both with relative ease, which partly explains why the movie stands as the most successful release in China, second only to James Cameron's ''Titanic.'' 
The story takes off with the title character, a nameless warrior played by the appealing martial-arts film star Jet Li, en route to the kingdom of Qin, whose ruler hopes to unite the warring Chinese states into an empire. Once ensconced under heavy guard and the scrutiny of the Qin king (Chen Dao Ming), ''Nameless'' relates how he vanquished the king's most feared enemies, Sky (Donnie Yen), Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) and the most powerful warrior of all, Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). 
When the king rejects the account, Nameless spins a second, a third and finally a fourth version, changes in perspective that Mr. Zhang and his excellent production team signal with startling shifts of color that alternately flood the screen with a red as vivid as that of a Little Red Book, a spotless white, a delicate blue and a pale pistachio so mouthwatering you may want to lick the screen. 
Despite the modest complications of the film's flashback structure, the tale cooked up by Mr. Zhang and his co-writers Li Feng and Wang Bin is storybook simple. After a knockout fight between Nameless and Sky, which finds the opponents violently bouncing off a courtyard like squash balls, Nameless travels to the kingdom of Zhao, which is preparing for an attack from Qin. 
There, Nameless meets Snow and Broken Sword, warring lovers who have holed up together in a calligraphy school along with several dozen students, an old master and a comely young servant named Moon (Zhang Ziyi). Much of the rest of the film and certainly everything that makes this story more than soulless spectacle involves this ravishing ménage à trois, whose passions erupt as fiercely as any of the film's fights though often to more devastating effect. 
Filled with meticulous set pieces, including a showdown between Snow and Moon set among swirls of golden-yellow leaves, ''Hero'' is easy on the eyes, but it's too segmented to gather much momentum and too art-directed to convey much urgency. And at least for this viewer, the founding of the first Chinese empire weighs in as less compelling than Mr. Leung's melting eyes, Ms. Cheung's implacable beauty and Ms. Zhang's ability to flicker from rage to vulnerability with hummingbird grace and speed. This remarkable young actress, who first came to attention here in Ang Lee's ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' will next be seen in Mr. Zhang's ''House of Flying Daggers.'' That more recent period epic, which had its premiere to great acclaim at Cannes in May and comes out later this year, indicates that with ''Hero'' Mr. Zhang was just warming up. 
If ''Hero'' proves to be less than the sum of its attractive parts, it's nonetheless generally pleasurable. That's particularly true if you don't think too hard and long about the implications of the noble sacrifices various characters make in the name of a unified China or what this subtitled version of the film calls ''our land.'' (In at least one DVD copy the same phrase is translated as ''all under heaven.'') 
Many of Mr. Zhang's earlier features were initially banned in China and more recently he has directed state-sponsored films promoting China's successful efforts to serve as host for the next summer Olympics and World Expo. For better or for worse, Mr. Zhang's ability to provide the powers that be with palatable stories is apparently no longer in doubt and neither is his talent for putting on a really big show. 
''Hero'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film includes sword and arrow violence, discreet bloodshed and some emotionally intense exchanges.

‽Exorcist: The Beginning‽,‽Spinning heads, cascades of pea soup and your mother's Army boots are nowhere to be found in ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' but lovers of the ridiculous may be delighted to know that the specter of little Linda Blair a-twitch and a-tremble is not entirely forgotten. A prequel to ''The Exorcist,'' William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent and its very own bag of cheap tricks. But when push comes to demonic shove, hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup just as surely as some producers have no shame. 
''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' which opened nationwide yesterday and given its doleful prospects may soon be known as ''Exorcist: The End,'' is the third feature film to be squeezed from the pulpy remains of Mr. Friedkin's original. (That film spawned two less-acclaimed sequels, and four years ago it was re-released in theaters with some padding and tweaks.) Based on the William Peter Blatty best seller, the first ''Exorcist'' mostly entails the efforts of two priests trying to beat the devil out of Ms. Blair's 12-year-old with the aid of pop metaphysics and some exceedingly dated special effects. A monster hit and very effective for a certain teenager who must remain nameless, Mr. Friedkin's film has not held up well, but compared with this latest effort does vaguely resemble the classic of 1970's cinema its fans tout it as. 
''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was directed by Renny Harlin, whose previous efforts include a solid ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequel, a bad ''Die Hard'' sequel and the diverting thriller ''The Long Kiss Goodnight.'' Slick and devoid of any obvious personal signature, Mr. Harlin's directorial style is serviceable enough for a movie like ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' which exists solely to rake in cash during its opening weekend and settle into a long shelf-life in the DVD hereafter. 
As it happens, the DVD release will be more interesting than the theatrical one if, as floated in Variety, it includes the version of this prequel shot by the director Paul Schrader. Mr. Schrader was fired from the project on grounds that his prequel was not scary. Mr. Schrader, in turn, had replaced the film's initial director, John Frankenheimer, who died during preproduction. 
All this background noise, alas, turns out to be more interesting than what has managed to finally make it on to the screen. Written by Alexi Hawley, who was brought in to revamp William Wisher and Caleb Carr's earlier screenplay, ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' opens centuries ago with a priest stumbling through a landscape littered with bloodied corpses and the writhing bodies of the soon to be dead. From there it's a fast cut to Cairo circa 1949, where amid the putatively exotic third-world sights and sounds the Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard sits in a bar wearing the rumpled white suit and anomie of a B-movie hero. This world-weary traveler is, of course, Merrin, the same character played by the Swedish actor Max von Sydow in ''The Exorcist,'' but now without the sanctity of the priestly collar. 
What ensues essentially conforms to the movie horror manual, though the production does benefit from the talents of the Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who has given the film a nice nicotine-stain patina. Wrapped in this burnished orange glow, Merrin, having taken a mysterious assignment, creases his brow and tries to discover what a Catholic church is doing buried in the sand in northern Kenya (actually Italy's Cinecittà Studios), which is where most of the film's 117 draggy minutes play out. Along for the ride are the usual movie suspects, including a beautiful doctor with peek-a-boo décolletage and a fondness for late-night showering (Izabella Scorupco), a young priest straight from the Vatican (James D'Arcy), a helpful local with a bull's-eye fixed to his forehead (Andrew French) and various other sacrificial lambs, including children, all of whom are lovingly skewered with graphic detail. 
Despite the body count and Mr. Harlin's reliance on shock cuts and loud noises, ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' singularly fails to deliver any palpable shivers. Perhaps more expectedly, given the torturous production history and the unceremonious introduction of the movie (the studio didn't screen the film for critics until the night before it opened), it does afford the occasional and presumably unintended laugh. Still, despite the risible dialogue, the bulging eyeballs, the heaving bosoms, the digitally rendered hyenas and squirming maggots, the movie fails to achieve the status of the instant camp classic. That's partly because the vibe of the film is too torpid. It simply doesn't have the buoyancy of camp, but mostly because it's deeply unpleasant to watch children, even fictional children, murdered on the altar of greed. Thrills rarely get cheaper or more loathsome. 
''Exorcist: The Beginning'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for graphic bloody violence, including images of young children being shot and torn apart by animals.

‽Without a Paddle‽,‽As every red-blooded American male is at least partially aware, 1972 was the year camping trips lost their innocence. That was when the movie ''Deliverance'' introduced a new specter into the horror show of macho nightmares. Thanks to ''Deliverance'' and many subsequent rip-offs, every camper knows that behind every tree may lurk a sadistic, rotten-toothed hillbilly itching to rape a soft city slicker and make him squeal like a pig in front of his friends. 
The homosexual panic instilled by ''Deliverance'' fuels the running joke (if that's the word for it) driving the uneasy laughs evoked by the loathsome comedy ''Without a Paddle,'' which opens today nationwide. Three buddies, 30 going on 13, embark on a ridiculous treasure hunt in the Pacific Northwest. Although no rape actually takes place, the threat of it is a constant source of leering humor. When the treasure hunters run afoul of a pair of gun-toting marijuana growers who resemble outlaw bikers, rape, torture and murder seem probable punishments, should the campers be caught. 
Much of the movie is a frantic chase through the forest, in which the beer-bellied beasts pursue the wimpy city slickers. At one point, the friends hide in a treehouse where two nature-loving beauties are living an environmentally pure life. But even here, the dreaded possibility of androgyny raises its head, when one of the women (who don't shave) reveals a hairy leg. When the beasts arrive, the women's stored-up bags of excrement come in handy as stink bombs dropped from above. 
Later in ''Without a Paddle,'' directed by Steven Brill, the friends, shivering and nearly naked in a downpour, find themselves forced to curl up together in a ball to avoid hypothermia. Homosexual panic is exploited for easy guffaws as the companions, wincing in revulsion, cling to one another fearing the worst (a stray erection), and of course the worst happens. Much is also made of the fondness of Dan (Seth Green), the wimpiest of the three, for the old Culture Club hit ''Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?,'' an affection for which signifies possible gayness. Dan sings it out loud to combat his claustrophobia while squirming through a tunnel. 
To be fair, ''Without a Paddle'' is only the latest in a spate of teenage and post-teen buddy comedies to trade on gay panic for laughs. The movie, which pushes its ugly humor further than most, follows Dan (a doctor with a suitcase full of phobias), and his grownup childhood buddies Tom (Dax Shepard), and Jerry (Matthew Lillard) on their jaunt back to nature. Tom is a pathological liar with a bogus résumé as a whitewater rapids guide, and Jerry is an overstressed insurance executive with infallibly bad judgment when it comes to roughing it. 
The trip is inspired by the death of Billy, the fourth and most glamorous member of their childhood clique. As boys they used to fantasize searching for the $200,000 stash of a legendary bank robber who disappeared in the forests of Oregon. When they reconvene in their childhood treehouse after Billy's funeral, they discover the treasure map he drew, along with a cereal box compass, and decide to honor his memory by venturing into the wild and fulfilling his quest. 
In an early life-threatening mishap, they are menaced by a computer-generated bear with a taste for cellphones. The overlong bear sequence is so poorly coordinated that the animal poses no palpable physical threat. The movie's final joke and homage to ''Deliverance'' is the appearance of Burt Reynolds himself as a shaggy hermit who has lived in the woods for 30 years. With Mr. Reynolds consenting to lend his name to such a shabby enterprise, the joke is really on him. 
''Without a Paddle'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for abundant profanity and sexual innuendo.

‽Nicotina‽,‽''Nicotina,'' a grisly, comical shaggy-dog thriller from Mexico, provides the latest evidence that, a decade after ''Pulp Fiction,'' the international movement we might call Tarantinismo is alive and well. Or maybe just alive. 
''Nicotina,'' which opens today nationally, was directed by Hugo Rodríguez from a script by Martín Salinas, and while it demonstrates some formal ingenuity, it is for the most part a tasteless and derivative stew of overdone jokes, chronological tricks and labored shock effects. Mr. Tarantino has long since moved on (and can hardly be blamed for the extent of his influence), but Mr. Rodríguez and Mr. Salinas are still messing around with his discarded gimmicks, along with bits and pieces from other aggressively cool movies from the recent past, like ''Run Lola Run'' and ''Amores Perros.'' 
At the center of the plot, as you might expect, is a caper gone awry. A computer hacker named Lolo (Diego Luna) has procured some Swiss bank access codes, and his confederates, Nene (Lucas Crespi) and Tomson (Jesús Ochoa), plan to give them to some Russian mobsters in exchange for diamonds. Such work is a bit of a distraction for Lolo, whose vocation is spying on his pretty neighbor (Marta Beláustegui), a cellist whose every word and gesture makes its way to his desktop monitor. It says a lot about the filmmakers' sensibility that Lolo, objectively a creepy, unapologetic voyeur, is the most sympathetic character in the picture. 
Not that his feelings matter much. A movie like ''Nicotina'' runs on travestied emotions and daredevil kineticism. Mr. Rodríguez does have a good eye and an assured sense of timing, and he has assembled a cast of interesting actors, whom the story arranges into quarreling pairs. Nene and Tomson carry on a running debate about the dangers of smoking, which turns into a gangster philosophy seminar on the relationship between fate and coincidence. Meanwhile, two married couples, each running a small business, are drawn into the action: Carmen (Rosa María Bianchi) and Goyo (Rafael Inclán) squabble over money in their modest hairdressing salon, while Beto (Daniel Giménez Cacho) and Clara (Carmen Madrid) fight about mislabeled medicines and smoking in their pharmacy. 
Given the film's title, it is not surprising that smoking figures so prominently in the story. Each pair of characters, including Lolo and his neighbor, consists of a smoker and a nonsmoker, and the picture has the antic, irritable energy of a 90-minute nicotine fit. The narrative, which unfolds in real time, is punctuated by shootings and other acts of violence that are meant to serve as brutal punch lines, truncating colorful and surreal passages of criminal incompetence and domestic disorder. But sudden, violent death is not really all that funny, and the rising body count of ''Nicotina'' suggests that at the end, having boxed themselves into an elaborate and unconvincing story, Mr. Salinas and Mr. Rodríguez found themselves out of ideas and out of breath. 
''Nicotina'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for many scenes of graphic violence.

‽We Don't Live Here Anymore‽,‽For as long as anyone can remember, American movie actors have been exploring their vulnerable and sensitive sides. Masculine displays of unguarded feeling and agonized introspection may be the norm in serious dramas, but the depiction of genuine male weakness remains something of a taboo. Very few leading men are brave enough to risk appearing cowardly, indecisive or passive-aggressive, and ordinary men in the audience, observing these traits onscreen, are likely to decline the invitation to identify with them. 
We would much rather think of ourselves as stoic, fearless and empathetic, however distant our real selves are from these ideals. 
The willingness to appear weak -- to represent, in other words, a familiar variety of real, contemporary American man -- may be Mark Ruffalo's great distinction as an actor. Even when he plays cops, in pictures like Jane Campion's ''In the Cut'' and Michael Mann's ''Collateral,'' he does it with a visible tremble of hesitation. In Kenneth Lonergan's ''You Can Count on Me,'' the film that first brought him widespread attention, Mr. Ruffalo's character was generous and sweet-natured, but also feckless, selfish and unreliable, in perpetual flight from maturity. 
Jack Linden, the straying husband he plays in ''We Don't Live Here Anymore,'' a thoroughly intelligent, half-satisfying story of marital woe that opens today in New York and Los Angeles, is more solidly settled into the trappings (and traps) of adulthood, with a wife, two young children and a job teaching literature at a small New England college. But he is still, underneath his dutiful displays of grown-up responsibility, a petulant and manipulative boy. Jack is a complicated character -- a nice guy skilled in cruelty and betrayal, a thoughtful person who can't think straight about his actions -- and your response to him is likely to hover between sympathy and revulsion. 
This mixed reaction is only fitting. Mr. Ruffalo's asymmetrical face, with its soft mouth and large, worried eyes, was designed to show ambivalence, and the film, adapted from two novellas by Andre Dubus, is more interested in observing the nuances of domestic and sexual behavior than in judging its sad, confused inhabitants. Jack's weakness occupies the foreground of the story. (In the story that gives the film its title, he is the first-person narrator.) 
But he is only one player in an uncomfortable four-way game of envy, longing and dissatisfaction. He is sleeping with Edith (Naomi Watts), who is married to Hank (Peter Krause), a writer who is Jack's colleague, jogging partner and best (if not only) friend. Edith initiated the affair as revenge for Hank's earlier infidelities, and as a way of assuaging his own guilt, Jack nudges his wife, Terry (Laura Dern), into a dalliance with Hank. 
Compared with Jack, whose air of unease and self-doubt are part of his attraction, Hank has the smirk of a man who has it all figured out. Even at his moments of torment, when his writing is going badly, he exudes a smooth, knowing self-confidence. He and Edith have a little more money than Jack and Terry, and their house is quieter, cleaner and more modern. Jack's envy of his friend is palpable, even as it remains mostly unspoken. His affair with Edith is partly a campaign of covert aggression against Hank, and also against Terry, whose disorderly housekeeping and emotional volatility stand in vivid contrast to Edith's cool, genteel melancholy. 
All of this is, perhaps, a bit too schematic. The sneaking and coupling, the revelations and exposures that drive the narrative of ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' at times come close to the hectic door-slamming of bedroom farce; they might, at any rate, if the sex actually took place in bedrooms, or if the movie had a sense of humor. Dubus's plain-spoken prose has an undertone of Yankee wryness; the somber, autumnal quiet that governs his stories is broken, at crucial moments, by a crackle of laughter at the dogged ridiculousness that attends even moments of great distress. A hint of this survives in some of the dialogue that Larry Gross's screenplay has carefully lifted from Dubus's pages: Jack's odd, offhand use of the word carnivorous, for example, or the tinny grandiloquence he falls into during an argument with Terry. 
But this film's director, John Curran, who made the aching, unsettling bohemian romance ''Praise'' in 1998, is not inclined to rescue his characters with levity. The music, by Michael Convertino, lies over the action like a shadow, gathering force from time to time to create a vague, insistent feeling of dread. An uncanny suspense ripples through the movie. Some of its recurrent images -- a railroad crossing, a rushing river -- carry a premonition of mortal danger, and you watch nervously, certain that something terrible is going to happen. 
This anxiety, which is not altogether misplaced, turns ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' from a domestic melodrama into a kind of marital film noir. Emotional violence rarely seems so menacing, or so close to the real thing, and the murk and mystery of marriage, adultery and friendship have seldom been illuminated with such harsh precision. Ms. Dern forsakes all vanity and makes no obvious plays for the audience's sympathy, even though her Terry may deserve it more than anyone else. She and Mr. Ruffalo skulk around each other in a dance of petty resentment and maladroit tenderness, which climaxes in one of the most lacerating and believable scenes of imploding love since Diane Keaton and Albert Finney fell apart in ''Shoot the Moon.'' 
Mr. Curran and Mr. Gross rotate the story on its axis, shifting perspective to allow each couple, married and otherwise, a moment or two of intimate revelation. ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is a cracked, dark crystal of a movie, but what it lacks is an adequate setting. The film's scope is so rigorously limited to the two families that when Hank and Edith give a party (to celebrate the publication of one of his poems), the presence of other people comes as something of a shock. Wait a minute, they have other friends? How could that be? The four of them behave, for the most part, like survivalists stranded in the remote wilderness, dependent on one another almost to the point of cannibalism. 
Dubus wrote ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' and ''Adultery,'' the other novella that is the basis for this movie, in the 1970's, and some of this film's efforts to bring his characters into the present give off a mothbally whiff of anachronism. In some cases this is trivial, as when Hank makes a big show of burning the manuscript of his novel, which is an empty gesture or a redundant one because he composed it on a laptop. 
More awkward is the film's notion of marriage -- in particular of wifehood -- which seems to date not to the stripped-down short-story realism of the 70's but to the campus novels of the 50's. If Edith and Terry ever had professional or intellectual ambitions of their own, we don't hear about them. Their status as unhappy homemakers seems to result not from postfeminist choice, but from prefeminist habit. 
But if the social context of ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is blurry and unreal, what happens inside those marriages is anything but. Compassionate though it is, this is not a movie that offers much in the way of solace. It insists that there is no end to human weakness, and not much cure for it either. That's pretty strong stuff. 
''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sex and strong language.

‽The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement‽,‽In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for the new feature-length fairy tale ''The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,'' the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks English accented by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway), a onetime San Francisco teenager turned old-world pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. 
The story opens with Mia graduating from college (when we last saw her she was in high school) and zipping off to Genovia, which her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), hopes she will govern someday soon. As in the original ''Princess Diaries,'' much of the putative comedy involves the free-spirited Mia working in gentle, contrapuntal harmony with her veddy, veddy proper grandmother. Because the ugly duckling has already molted into a swan, however, the plot this time around hinges on some minor palace intrigue and romances with two blow-dried suitors who take turns holding the royal hand while keeping a safe distance from the royal chastity. In between the cooing and wooing, the pratfalls and product placements, Ms. Hathaway and Ms. Andrews flash smiles of such dazzling wattage they could carry California through its next energy crisis. 
''The Princess Diaries 2'' was directed by Garry Marshall, who has been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in ''Pretty Woman'' and in the first ''Princess Diaries'' movie. Mr. Marshall, whose place in pop-culture heaven was secured long ago by television comedies like ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' on which he served as a writer, is not much of a film director. Depending on the budget, his movies look either cheap (like this one) or studio slick (''Pretty Woman''), and tend to have the same flat, presentational visual style that's familiar from most sitcoms. (That's why his movies fit so snugly into airplane monitors.) And as in those sitcoms shot in front of live audiences, Mr. Marshall's actors often play to the camera and wait for laughs, which can be a serious problem when the screenplay is as deeply unfunny as this one. 
Built on vintage and newly minted clichés, Shonda Rhimes's script combines a classic storybook scenario with the usual self-help uplift. After undergoing a radical makeover in the first ''Princess'' movie, Anne has metamorphosed into a self-possessed young woman. She knows how to walk in high heels, iron the frizz out of her hair and whirl around the dance floor with ineligible partners without making them feel bad. True, her sexuality comes across as weirdly underdeveloped, closer to that of the preadolescents who constitute this G-rated movie's core audience, than that of most typical college graduates. But that's in keeping with the character whose appeal is largely predicated on being essentially unremarkable in every respect in looks, intelligence, personality and that most dubious of designated female traits, niceness. 
There's nothing wrong with being nice if it means giving succor to the poor and being kind to animals, but there's something unsettling about a character as bland, mushy and fiber-free as soggy corn flakes. Once upon a different time, Mia might have found her truest self by hanging out with the soulfully truculent adolescent girls in ''Ghost World.'' Instead, Ms. Andrews whisked in with a face frozen in do-re-mi beatitude and carried Mia off to a world where every unruly hair and thought is as smoothed down as the grass on a windswept Bavarian mountain. In the first film, Mia discovered she was to the manner born. Now, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake too.

‽
‽Collateral‽,‽IN ''Collateral,'' the edgy new thriller from the director Michael Mann, the city never sleeps; it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), and the assassin Vincent (Tom Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. As the pair cover the city, looping over interchanges and down wide open boulevards, they travel a landscape alive with wild animals and wilder men, noisy with unfamiliar music and chatter, and punctured by the hard pop of occasional gunfire. 
Following a few preliminaries, including some flirty minutes with Jada Pinkett Smith as a harried passenger, the story gets down to its dirty business with Vincent jumping into Max's meticulously clean taxicab. Nattily turned out in a gray suit and matching salt-and-pepper hair and light beard, Vincent takes the story precisely seven minutes east of downtown. 
With the meter running, Max waits for his fare, fetishistically poring over luxury-car brochures and fantasizing about the limousine company he hopes to start. Then a body lands splat on the roof of the taxi, shattering the cabbie's nerves and a large section of his front window, and Stuart Beattie's screenplay kicks into overdrive. Vincent, Max discovers to his horror, is a killer for hire, and this is only the first stop on what looks to be a very strange trip. 
Wired for action, ''Collateral,'' which opens nationwide today, initially seems like a return to basics for Mr. Mann, as exemplified by ostensibly straight early films like ''Thief,'' about a safecracker in love, and a retreat from the more self-consciously serious films like ''Ali,'' his underrated movie about the legendary boxer. 
The new film takes place against a backdrop that pits a drug cartel against law enforcement agencies presumably intent on shutting it down, and to that end features big, beefy men wielding big, scary guns and the jolting image of Vincent hitting his marks, specifically with two bullets to the chest and one through the head. But because Mr. Mann makes thrillers the way that John Ford made westerns, using genre as a way into meaning rather than as an escape, ''Collateral'' bears little relation to the usual Hollywood blowout. 
That becomes evident as Max and Vincent drive through the emptied-out streets and the story shifts from a two-hander to a road movie, a tourist-board nightmare and a bloodied valentine to the director's adopted hometown. A portrait of radically different souls clinging to radically different paths, ''Collateral'' hinges on the moment when fate intersects with choice. 
Vincent is clearly a nutcase, seething with inarticulate rage and locked-down demons, but he's also a man seemingly in charge of his destiny. For Max, who's been hanging onto his well-tended fantasy for years (''this is just part time,'' he repeatedly insists of his hack job), his passenger represents an imminent threat, but also a necessary wake-up call. For Mr. Mann, it always seems, there is nothing worse than a life on automatic pilot, not even death. 
Mr. Foxx can't have had an easy time playing foil to the world's biggest movie star, but he holds his own gracefully. For his part, Mr. Cruise, whose famous self-discipline has helped turn him into a bankable personality and a less-than-believable regular guy, makes Vincent scarily convincing. Underappreciated as an actor, Mr. Cruise is most at ease when he can deliver a good portion of his performance through his body. He's an intensely physical performer, one whose jumping muscles and athleticism often express the inner workings of his characters more plausibly than any scripted line. Clad in the sort of form-fitting, slightly too-short slacks favored more by modern dancers and Gene Kelly than (I assume) contract killers, he plays Vincent from the outside in, as a citadel of physical perfection and ability. 
That makes the star an ideal fit not merely for this role but for this director, whose male characters inevitably express themselves more through their deeds than their words. One of the signatures of Mr. Mann's films is that while his male characters tend to be tight-lipped (if often very loud and certainly dogged in their beliefs), the director's visual style and musical choices verge on the extreme, at times the operatic. Filled with incessant rhythms, washes of gaudy color and heartbreaking beauty, the films boldly convey the passions and deep feelings the director's men rarely voice. It's the sort of expressionistic gambit that pointedly makes the case that movies create meaning both with what's on the scripted page and with images of palm trees bobbing against a moonlit sky and the everyday Los Angeles surrealism of coyotes prowling an otherwise urban street. 
Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, ''Collateral'' scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up at night, how cars become prostheses of ourselves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, ''Collateral'' is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job. (It's no wonder the director gives the Sears ''Craftsman'' logo a loving nod.) Whether chasing fictionalized serial killers or those serial killers who run tobacco companies, Mr. Mann's men risk everything -- happiness, women, life itself -- to get the job done, which explains why these fastidiously executed commercial films are not just entertainments, but statements of personal faith. 
It's in this sense that despite the spent bullets and fallen bodies, ''Collateral'' is very much the product of a distinct vision, one as eager to push technological limits (the film was shot with the most advanced video cameras) as to upend the usual studio white-hero/black-villain formula. For the director, such casting isn't a sop to political correctness, but a reflection of his city's demographics. Unmistakably urban, Mr. Mann's Los Angeles is a city where not every black man knows how to handle a gun, where Korean and Latino revelers jam dance clubs rarely seen in pop culture and where a light-rail line nicknamed the Ghetto Blue promises salvation after a really, really bad night behind the wheel. Best of all, it's a city where, if someone asks with corrosive incredulity, ''Do you like it here?,'' the only plausible answer is, ''It's my home.'' 
''Collateral'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes a lot of very intense gun violence, some phony corpses laid out in an autopsy room and strong adult language.

‽
‽Open Water‽,‽In ''Open Water,'' a low-budget, digital-video feature, a vacationing couple spend many hours stranded in the middle of the ocean hoping not to be eaten by sharks. The film, written and directed by Chris Kentis and produced by his wife, Laura Lau, is a minimalist thriller, made without special effects, animatronic monsters or histrionically suffering movie stars. The sharks, whose fins occasionally pierce the surface of the water and whose implacable bodies are glimpsed gliding beneath it, are real. They show no particular hostility toward Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis), even as lunchtime passes and the dinner hour approaches. Susan and Daniel, meanwhile, drift from stoicism to panic toward exhaustion as the tropical sea ripples around them. 
The sharks are scary, and the ocean is vast and indifferent, but the most effective parts of ''Open Water,'' which is ultimately too modest to be very memorable, evoke a deeper terror, one that can chill even those viewers who would never dream of putting on a wet suit and jumping off a boat. Susan and Daniel, nondescript, stressed-out tourists staying in an unidentified Caribbean resort town, set off for a morning dive with a charter company that proves a little too easygoing. 
Somehow, the crew mixes up the head count, and the boat chugs away while Susan and Daniel are still underwater. This casual abandonment seems to fulfill a primal anxiety experienced by children who wander away from their parents -- not just a fear of being lost, but a dread of being forgotten. Whether or not Susan and Daniel survive the sharks and the elements, they have already, in a sense, ceased to exist, an implication driven home when the camera returns now and then to shore, where people dance and drink and shop as if nothing terrible could ever happen. 
The movie succeeds in mobilizing the audience's dread, but it fails to make us care as much as we should about the fate of its heroes. Mr. Kentis has taken pains not to make them too interesting, and Mr. Travis and Ms. Ryan oblige by not trying to act too much. At the beginning, before the boat sets out, we glean that things are not altogether harmonious between them: she is distracted by her work; he is passive-aggressively needy; their sex life seems tepid. 
These unexplored, hinted-at tensions blossom in the movie's best and wittiest scene, a spat that erupts after seven hours of treading water. As Susan and Daniel spit the clichés of modern couplehood across -- ''Are you saying this is my fault?'' ''Let's just drop the subject'' -- you can't help but laugh. 
And it's only under extreme duress that the two of them reveal any humor. ''Feel better now?'' Susan asks Daniel after he curses the incompetent charter company. ''Well I wouldn't say better, exactly,'' he replies. She also forgives him for watching ''Shark Week'' and diving adventure shows on television, though she does note that her preference would have been to go skiing instead. Given the circumstances, it's hard to argue. 
''Open Water'' feeds on the appetite for danger that such programs reflect. Like the semi-documentary ''Touching the Void,'' this film, based on a true story, titillates us with the dread of (someone else's) exotic death, and teases us with the illusion that what we are watching is real. The bland ordinariness of the characters, the flat colors and jerky rhythms of digital cinematography and the constriction of the drama give the picture some impact, but not much resonance. It pulls you in and then pushes you away, so that you leave saying, ''Wow, how awful'' without having experienced a full measure of awe. 
''Open Water'' opens today in New York City, Los Angeles and Orange County, San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, Seattle, Denver, Minneapolis, Detroit, San Diego and San Jose, Calif. The film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has brief nudity, profanity and the constant threat of grisly death.

‽Little Black Book‽,‽Batting the lashes of her large, vacant eyes and sucking her lower lip into a pout, Brittany Murphy suggests a dumbed-down Meg Ryan with a gloss of Melanie Griffith in the sweet but mostly sour comedy ''Little Black Book.'' The movie, which opens nationally today, aspires to be a dewy-eyed self-help fable for ambitious young women folded into a mean-spirited satire of Jerry Springer-style reality television. 
Offering few laughs and a climactic scene of breathtaking cruelty, this plot-heavy movie, directed by Nick Hurran from a screenplay by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell, draws you into its malignant force field against your will. 
Almost from the beginning, the film's sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another way, ''Little Black Book'' would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed ''Working Girl'' (with New Jersey replacing Staten Island as the plucky heroine's home base and Carly Simon's music pushing the story along) and a more acerbic ''Broadcast News.'' (That movie's star, Holly Hunter, appears as Ms. Murphy's most poisonous colleague). In trying to be both at once, ''Little Black Book'' can't hold a candle to either. 
Ms. Murphy's character, Stacy Holt, who narrates the movie in a too-cute voice, begins the film by describing her twin obsessions: Diane Sawyer and the catechism of romance according to Ms. Simon's hits. After a sketch of Stacy's childhood, we meet the grown-up Stacy, who is living in uneasy bliss with Derek (Ron Livingston), a dapper recruiter for a New Jersey hockey team and a man with a past who won't discuss his romantic history. 
Stacy's dreams of a big-time career in television inch one step closer to reality when she lands a job as an associate producer for Kippie Kann (Kathy Bates), a fading talk show host given to topics like ''Grandma's a Hooker, So Handle It.'' When Derek goes on a business trip, Stacy is coaxed by her colleague Barb (Ms. Hunter) into going through the Palm Pilot he accidentally left behind. There Stacy discovers several scrapbooks' worth of material on his ex-girlfriends, along with evidence that he remains in close touch with one in particular. 
The recently jilted Barb (the closest thing to a female Iago to come along in years) persuades Stacy to interview three of them by pretending to consider them as guests on the show. (Any thinking person in her right mind would, of course, say no). But Lulu (Josie Maran), a bulimic supermodel; Rachel (Rashida Jones), a gynecologist with a book to peddle; and Joyce (Julianne Nicholson), a rising chef, are only too happy to oblige. 
Stacy learns to her shock that Joyce, a hockey fan who still pines for Derek, is seeing him regularly as a friend. And in fact, Ms. Nicholson's Joyce is so much more attractive, capable and emotionally honest than Ms. Murphy's whiny, self-centered Stacy that the notion that he would trade in Joyce for Stacy is ludicrous. 
Although Ms. Murphy plays Stacy as an injured princess, the character's relentless treachery speaks for itself and outweighs her shallow contrition once her game is discovered. The movie also defeats both Ms. Hunter and Ms. Bates, two of our finest character actors. Ms. Bates is simply miscast in an unfocused role, and Ms. Hunter's transition from perky sidekick to psychopathic meddler is too big a stretch for anyone. The message sent by her character -- that mean girls only get meaner as they mature, especially without a man -- is hardly an empowering one for women. 
The very elements that the rest of the movie tries to weave together are reconciled in the frequent songs by Ms. Simon, which describe in a blunt, self-assured tone the feelings of jealousy, insecurity and sexual competition that can plague even the best relationships. If only the movie were half as honest and self-aware as its soundtrack. 
''Little Black Book'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sexual situations.

‽The Manchurian Candidate‽,‽THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE,'' which opens today nationwide, is Jonathan Demme's second attempt to update a classic cold war thriller. Two years ago, in ''The Truth About Charlie,'' he tried to drag ''Charade,'' Stanley Donen's suave Hitchcockian romance, into the messy, multicultural modern world, an admirable effort that unfortunately did not yield a very enjoyable movie, in spite of the charms of Thandie Newton. 
This time, using John Frankenheimer's original adaptation of Richard Condon's novel as a touchstone rather than a template, Mr. Demme has been more successful. Not only has he made a political thriller that manages to be at once silly and clever, buoyantly satirical and sneakily disturbing, but he has recovered some of the lightness and sureness of touch that had faded from his movies after ''The Silence of the Lambs.'' 
Some of the fun of his retrofitted ''Candidate,'' which opens with Wyclef Jean's bracing version of John Fogerty's ''Fortunate Son,'' comes from its playful acknowledgment of -- and frequent departure from -- the first version, which was released in 1962, just in time for the Cuban missile crisis. The very first scenes peek in on a long, raucous game of poker, and fans of Mr. Frankenheimer's movie may anticipate the fateful appearance of the queen of diamonds. But this, like other winking evocations of the old ''Candidate,'' is a tease. 
The game Mr. Demme and the screenwriters, Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris, are playing involves a different set of strategies and symbols, as well as altered stakes. 
The first ''Manchurian Candidate'' was an exemplary piece of liberal paranoia, imagining the nefarious collusion between foreign, Communist totalitarians and their most ferocious domestic enemies, a conspiracy of the political extremes against the middle. That film, which climaxed at the 1956 Republican convention in New York, looked back from Camelot at an almost-plausible alternative history with a mixture of alarm and relief. The center, in the solid person of John F. Kennedy's pal Frank Sinatra, had held. 
The new version, after a prologue in the first Persian Gulf war, unfolds at a time succinctly and scarily identified as ''today,'' and proceeds from the nominating convention of a major political party toward a frenzied Election Night finale, feeding on an anxiety about the future that is neither exaggerated nor easily assuaged. Sinatra's character, Maj. Ben Marco, is played by Denzel Washington, and this time Marco is not the cool, rational unraveler of a vast conspiracy, but rather one of its victims. 
The public, coming upon this movie in a fraught political season, may be more interested in identifying the perpetrators. Though the party in question is not identified, it does not much resemble the real-world party currently in power. In the movie the United States is subject to terrorist attacks, which have become so routine that they are mentioned only in passing, and is fighting wars in small countries around the world. 
The chief danger to the republic, however, emanates not from the extremes -- a fanatical foreign enemy combined with a zealous administration -- but from the center, from the moderate wing of the opposition party and its corporate sponsors. In a smokeless back room at the convention, a venerable, liberal senator, played by Jon Voight (who does this kind of thing so often you may think he's playing himself), is dumped from the ticket in favor of Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), a young New York congressman whose mother, Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), is a formidable power broker and a tireless promoter of her son's career. 
You may notice a slight resemblance to a certain real-life New York senator, but Ms. Streep's swaggering, ice-cube-chewing performance is too full of inspired, unpredictable mischief to be mere mimickry. 
Poor Raymond, a queasy-looking fellow who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in the gulf war, turns out to be at the center of a diabolical conspiracy involving military adventurism, maternal monstrousness and big business string-pulling. ''Manchurian'' no longer refers to a region in China, but rather to a multinational defense conglomerate whose mind-control techniques are much more high-tech then the Maoist-Freudian brainwashing methods that were popular back in 1962. (The queen of diamonds is redundant when you can implant subcutaneous chips, though the Oedipus complex does seem to have survived the collapse of Communism.) 
Are we meant to think of Halliburton? Maybe, but this film's political sensibility is less Kerry-Edwards than McCain-Feingold. The shadowy desire for total political control that scared us in the cold war -- the threat of ''powers that will make martial law look like anarchy,'' as Angela Lansbury so memorably put it in the earlier film -- seems impossibly quaint next to the mundane, insatiable drive to wring profit out of the world's instability. 
The conspiracy -- which the chip implanted in my own skin prevents me from discussing further -- seems at once overreaching and curiously undermotivated. Its details and parameters are also not fully explained, which makes the tangle of plot twists at the end feel a little dishonest. But the story, as in ''Silence of the Lambs,'' is designed mainly to keep you alert and on edge so that you can appreciate Mr. Demme's eye for detail and his cast's witty bravado. 
Kimberly Elise slyly revises a part originated by Janet Leigh, and Jeffrey Wright and Bruno Ganz are memorably strange in small roles. Mr. Schreiber looks a lot like Laurence Harvey, the first Raymond Shaw, which may have prevented him from reinventing his character as thoroughly as he might have. 
Like Frankenheimer (and also like Brian DePalma in ''Blow-Out'') Mr. Demme grasps the aesthetic potential of political suspicion. A crucial symptom of clinical paranoia, after all, is the conviction that what seems to be offhand, incidental or meaningless is actually freighted with significance. It is a disorder well suited to movie watching (to say nothing of moviemaking), and Mr. Demme caters to it by filling his busy, hectic frames with tantalizing visual and aural clues that give the movie texture and momentum. 
Our guide through this maze is Mr. Washington, who plays Major Marco with the perfect blend of stoicism and agitation. Marco, who was Raymond's commanding officer in Kuwait, is plagued by strange dreams, and by the growing suspicion that what he remembers of the gulf war is not what really happened. His search for the truth and his struggle to stay sane are fundamentally at cross purposes, since the closer he comes to an accurate version of events the crazier he seems, to himself and everyone else. 
He must contend simultaneously with external events and internal demons, and this two-front battle plays out on Mr. Washington's downcast, noble features. He gives the film's extravagant public scandal a dimension of private sadness. 
Whether it will have any political resonance remains to be seen. The uncanny implications of Frankenheimer's ''Candidate'' after all came into focus long after its initial release, when it re-emerged as a curious period artifact in the waning years of the cold war. Mr. Demme's version, in bright color rather than smoky black and white, is more transparent and less enigmatic. Though its intricate plot is full of surprises, this kind of story no longer has much power to shock. Maybe we've grown used to paranoia as the only sane response to a world beyond our comprehension or control. Or maybe we've been brainwashed. 
''The Manchurian Candidate'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some intense violence, and a lot of the kind of language politicians use when they think the public isn't listening.

‽
‽Intimate Strangers‽,‽In Patrice Leconte's sardonic psychological thriller, ''Intimate Strangers,'' Sandrine Bonnaire portrays a Gallic answer to one of Alfred Hitchcock's sleek blond women of mystery. Imagine the Grace Kelly of ''Rear Window'' or the Kim Novak of ''Vertigo'' sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. 
''Intimate Strangers,'' directed by Mr. Leconte from a screenplay by Jérôme Tonnerre, establishes its mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. 
The film's running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink, William Faber (Fabrice Luchini), is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant whose good friend and recent romantic partner, Jeanne (Anne Brochet), has left him for a gym rat (Laurent Gamelon). Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character, Anna, has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, on the same dark floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult, Dr. Monnier (Michel Duchaussoy), practices a few doors away. 
Before William has a chance to correct Anna's mistake, she begins pouring out the story of her dysfunctional marriage, and he finds himself too intrigued to come clean. As he points out later, a tax accountant's relationship to a client parallels a psychotherapist's. Both professions involve knowing personal secrets and making decisions about what to reveal and what to hide. 
''Intimate Strangers'' takes place less in the real world than in the realm of voyeuristic fantasy -- in other words, in the realm of film itself, which allows us to ogle beautiful people under the cover of darkness. And Ms. Bonnaire is something to ogle. The film, which opens today in New York, presents longing as a kind of romantic science fiction in which the what-if? is risk free, and it is more delicious to imagine a transcendent passion than to engage in the messy, potentially disappointing mechanics of actual consummation. 
Another variation on the same idea drives the recent and wonderful Italian film ''Facing Windows,'' in which attractive neighbors who have surreptitiously observed and desired each other finally connect and face reality. Both films involve a lot of staring out of windows and gazing at reflections. 
''Intimate Strangers'' is also a riff on the Henry James novella ''The Beast in the Jungle,'' whose protagonist spends his life frozen in the expectation of a remarkable destiny that never materializes. Midway in Anna's therapy, William, whose inability to respond to her subtle romantic signals recalls the paralysis of James's protagonist, lends her the novella. On returning it, she complains about its sad ending. 
A dumpy, slightly effeminate middle-aged man with scared saucer eyes, Mr. Luchini's William (who secretly dances around his apartment to Wilson Pickett's ''In the Midnight Hour'') is another of the movie's jokes. It's difficult to explain Anna's discreet romantic interest in him except as a comic illustration of the notion that opposites attract. 
''Intimate Strangers'' has great fun puncturing the mystique of psychoanalysis. When William calls on Dr. Monnier to seek Anna's telephone number, the doctor withholds it but charges William for a session. Monnier, who has more than a passing resemblance to Freud, is as greedy as he is grandiose. He offers William free advice over lunch, then makes him pick up the tab. While they dine, he offers his own pompous (nonsensical) variation on Freud's question ''What do women want?'' (''Once ajar, the door to female mystery is hard to shut again'') and plants the notion in William's head that Anna's abusive husband may be imaginary. William, with his shyness and a sense of propriety that camouflage a burning curiosity, proves a much better therapist than his professionally accredited neighbor. 
Other characters who dart in and out of the movie include Williams's nosy, disapproving secretary, Mrs. Mulon (Hélène Surgère); Anna's wildly jealous husband, Marc (Gilbert Melki), who is aroused by the fantasy of his wife sleeping with William; and Chatel (Urbain Cancelier), a client of Monnier's whose elevator phobia Anna endeavors to cure after encountering him on the way to a session. 
In the spirit of the best Hitchcock, ''Intimate Strangers'' is seriously light. Or is it lightly serious? 
''Intimate Strangers'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for its frank sexual talk.

‽
‽The Village‽,‽The ubiquitous advertisements for ''The Village,'' which opens today nationwide, promise that ''nothing can prepare you.'' Nothing, that is, except M. Night Shyamalan's last three movies and a passing acquaintance with ''The Twilight Zone.'' It is hard to think of another filmmaker so utterly committed to the predictable manufacture of narrative surprise. His supernatural conceits may vary from picture to picture -- ghosts in ''The Sixth Sense,'' comic-book superheroics in ''Unbreakable,'' space aliens and crop circles in ''Signs'' -- but his stories are always built around a carefully disguised, meticulously prepared twist. 
You can pass a pleasant few minutes outside the theater talking it over with your friends, but the conversations, like the movies that inspire them, tend to sound the same. For every innocent who professes amazement, there will be a wiseguy who says he saw it coming all along and an earnest analyst who picks the whole thing apart, looking for clues, foreshadowings and logical inconsistencies. 
The last thing I want to do is spoil the fun, meager though it is. I will say, though, that while I am generally pretty obtuse about these matters, I had an inkling early on of where ''The Village'' was going, which I then dismissed as too ridiculous to consider. When I turned out to be right I felt less vindicated than cheated. The film's ridiculousness would not be so irksome if Mr. Shyamalan did not take his sleight of hand so seriously, if he did not insist on dressing this scary, silly, moderately clever fairy tale in a somber cloak of allegory. 
I suppose it is to his credit that he wants the audience to think -- about fear, security and the fine line between rationality and superstition -- as well as tremble, but his ideas are as sloppy and obvious as his direction is elegant and restrained. He turns an artful gothic tale into a homework assignment. 
His impressive cast, meanwhile, bustles around as if ''The Village'' were the school play -- ''Our Town,'' maybe, or ''The Lottery.'' Their village, which appears not to have a name, is somewhere in the preindustrial wilds of Pennsylvania. It is cut off from the rest of the world (referred to as ''the towns'') by forests inhabited by monstrous, mysterious creatures. 
An elaborate set of rules and customs has been devised to keep the beasts at bay: there are watchtowers, warning bells and amber flags and robes, and anything red (''the bad color'') must be buried. (These colors may, in the film's allegorical scheme, be intended to evoke the government's color-coded terror alerts.) Domestic animals are sometimes found killed and partly skinned, and now and again the monsters emerge from the shadows to frighten and warn the villagers. They are propitiated with fresh meat and earnest meetings of the village elders, a distinguished group that includes William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson and Cherry Jones. 
Otherwise, life goes on in its normal, old-fashioned storybook way. There are barn dances, weddings and big outdoor meals at tables laden with lovely victuals, all of it filmed in grayish reproduction-antique light by the incomparable Roger Deakins. People speak in a stately, wordy idiom, disdaining contractions and using the subjunctive with breathtaking precision. Mr. Hurt was born to talk this way -- he talks this way in all his movies -- which is no doubt why he was elected (or appointed, or whatever) village elder in chief (or school headmaster, or something). The younger folk have a tougher time of it, in particular Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Mr. Hurt's blind younger daughter, Ivy. 
Ms. Howard, making her movie debut, has enough charm to make her way through some of the script's sillier lines. ''Do you find me too much of a tomboy?'' she asks the moody Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). ''I do long to do boy things.'' As, no doubt, does he. So, for that matter, does the village idiot, Noah, played with good-natured hamminess by Adrien Brody. Indeed, the whole village seems to be possessed by barely suppressed yearnings and guilty secrets. These, more than the beasts in the woods, might have been the subject of an interesting, Hardyesque inquiry into small-town life, but Mr. Shyamalan once again uses the psychology of his characters as the ultimate red herring, fooling us into caring more about the people in the movie than he does. 
He does, at least, care about the way his movies look, and his disdain for newfangled special effects is refreshing. His mastery of classic suspense-movie framing and cutting is as impressive as ever, and the sound design, which layers James Newton Howard's spooky score with the equally sinister sounds of the forest, is impressive, especially when it evokes Ivy's blindness. At times you do sit up in your chair and crane your neck, as if you could see around the next bend of the story and glimpse what's coming. Then you do see it, and you burst out laughing. 
''The Village'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violent scenes and an atmosphere of pervasive menace.

‽
‽Garden State‽,‽''Garden State,'' Zach Braff's small, smart, off-kilter comedy, has the cheek to present itself as ''The Graduate 2004,'' although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as ''The Anti-Graduate 2004.'' From its story of the awakening of an emotionally numbed young man -- played by Mr. Braff, who wrote and directed the movie -- to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack that throws in vintage Simon and Garfunkel (''The Only Living Boy in New York''), ''Garden State'' obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. 
The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, Andrew Largeman, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because ''The Graduate'' established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through ''American Beauty'' and beyond, you expect ''Garden State'' to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. 
At one point ''Garden State'' drops a comic reference to Aldous Huxley's ''Brave New World'' in which the author's name is misidentified as Huxtable. Like many passing references in ''Garden State,'' this one is far from accidental. Just as the happy citizens of Huxley's dystopia were pacified by a drug called soma (a sort of idealized hybrid of Prozac and Ecstasy), Andrew has spent years cut off from his darker feelings with the aid of pharmaceuticals (including lithium) prescribed by his father, Gideon (Ian Holm), a pompous psychiatrist. 
What necessitates Andrew's return from the West Coast, where he works in a Vietnamese restaurant while struggling as an actor (he has had one prominent role in a made-for-TV movie), is his mother's death. Paraplegic from a freak accident for which Gideon tacitly blames his son, who was 9 at the time, his mother died at home in the bathtub. The father and son have never confronted the complicated layers of blame and guilt that have festered under Andrew's chemical insulation. 
Because Andrew has left his medications in Los Angeles, his buried emotions begin to stir. If you take ''Garden State'' as a generational statement, the plastics of ''The Graduate'' have been replaced by prescription drugs as the symbolic soul-destroying enemy. Recreational drugs are also questioned in a scene in which Andrew and a bunch of high school friends break through uncomfortable social barriers with the shortcuts of Ecstasy and pot. 
Without his medication Andrew experiences recurrent flash headaches. At his father's urging, he consults a neurologist (Ron Liebman), who finds nothing physically wrong but who gently advises him to switch psychiatrists. 
In the doctor's waiting room Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a charming, uninhibited motormouth and pathological liar who suffers from epilepsy. The friendship they strike up quickly blossoms into something more. Andrew, who found himself unable to cry at his mother's grave, squeezes his first real tear into a paper cup she holds under his left eye. 
As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, ''Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliché by turning it inside out is a worthy one. All the characters are aggressively quirky. Andrew's best friend from high school, Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), is a gravedigger and pothead who takes Andrew and Samantha to a quarry inhabited by a bohemian couple who live in a boat. Another high school friend, Albert (Denis O'Hare), who has made millions from patenting a no-noise version of Velcro, lives in a mansion devoid of furniture. 
There is no Mrs. Robinson to skewer as a predatory spiritual vacuum. The movie goes out of its way to appreciate two unusual moms: Mark's pot-smoking mother, Carol (Jean Smart), and Sam's ultra-homey mother, Olivia (Ann Dowd), who has taken an African student into their home. Ms. Portman's manic Sam and Mr. Braff's depressed Andrew make an appealing couple. 
As an actor, Mr. Braff (familiar from the television series ''Scrubs'') is a homely but handsome screen presence, like Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock. This movie's artfully lightheaded visual style combines the freneticism of vintage Richard Lester with the whimsy of Wes Anderson. When not whizzing to and fro, Lawrence Sher's cinematography occasionally pauses to frame an image with the same care for composition that Conrad L. Hall brought to ''American Beauty.'' 
But a scrupulous avoidance of any solemnity makes ''Garden State'' a bit too light for its own good. Its method of skipping from one incident to another feels scatterbrained, and promising characters are left behind in the rush. The forced feel-good ending seems tacked on, a thudding final sentence with too many exclamation points. 
''Garden State'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language.

‽
‽She Hate Me‽,‽In his angry new comedy, ''She Hate Me,'' Spike Lee carries his political exasperation beyond outrage into chaos. The carelessness with which he hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of last-ditch marketing: grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball, and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. 
This feisty New York filmmaker with a nose for tabloid news has always relished playing provocateur and setting brush fires with his rub-your-face-in-it style of riffing off the headlines. Usually his rampages leave behind at least some patches of scorched earth before burning out. 
''She Hate Me,'' which rattles on for nearly two and a half hours, is the first of his fiery diatribes that repeatedly fizzles as it goes along. 
Lashing out in all directions, Mr. Lee addresses white-collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. 
A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' harangue the next, ''She Hate Me'' can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh. The boilerplate polemics mouthed by stick-figure characters sound like the beery 3 a.m. debates of a college bull session that has outlasted its usefulness. 
The movie begins with a montage of crisp rippling currency that features the face of George W. Bush on a $3 bill. Then it introduces its semihero, Jack Armstrong (Anthony Mackie), a 30-year-old African-American smoothie and vice president of Progeia, a pharmaceutical giant desperate to be the first company to market an AIDS vaccine. 
When the Food and Drug Administration withholds its approval, Progeia's saintly chief researcher dives from an office window along with the company's stock. Reviewing the dead man's computer file, Jack learns of corporate dirty deeds, falsified data, shredded documents and stock manipulation. 
Confronting his bosses, he is told to keep his mouth shut but decides to turn whistle-blower. Summarily fired, his reputation smeared, his bank account frozen, he's suddenly a nobody, and the movie takes an awkward leap by comparing Jack's misfortune to the plight of Frank Wills, the security guard who reported the Watergate break-in and went on to die in poverty while the conspirators prospered. 
Enter Fatima (Kerry Washington), Jack's ex-fiancée, with whom he broke up after catching her in bed with a woman. Showing up with her girlfriend Alex (Dania Ramirez), Fatima offers him $10,000 to impregnate the two of them. Desperate for money, he reluctantly agrees. In short order, with Fatima acting as his agent, his apartment becomes a stud farm for lesbians willing to shell out $10,000 apiece for his seed. Infinitely potent and fertile, Jack takes on four or five women a night, eventually fathering 19 children for happy lesbian couples. His attitude toward his work is comically illustrated with animated sperms bearing his face wriggling toward grinning eggs. 
Long after ''She Hate Me'' has exhausted its material, it refuses to give up. In the last interminable third of the movie, Mr. Lee and his screenwriting collaborator, Michael Genet, throw in a lesbian Mafia princess, Simona (Monica Bellucci), whose father, Don Angelo Bonasera (John Turturro), does an extended, tedious parody of Marlon Brando in ''The Godfather.'' 
The point seems to be that the Mafia's notion of family is kinder and gentler than Progeia's inhuman family values propounded with Orwellian cynicism by its C.E.O., Leland Powell (Woody Harrelson), and his chief lieutenant, Margo Chadwick (Ellen Barkin in a Martha Stewart haircut). 
As usual in a Spike Lee film, the sexual politics are muddled. The director can't resist presenting Jack Armstrong as a yuppie version of the black sexual superman. Unveiling his manhood to a group of lesbians, who are the sort of gorgeous, slithery babes seen writhing in rap videos, his show is greeted with oohs and ahs of lustful appreciation. 
The movie eventually does a turnabout by giving him pangs of conscience brought on by the disapproval of his morally upstanding family. Jack, we're informed, is not to be confused with the negative stereotype of an African-American man who impregnates women and then disappears. In his heart and soul he, too, is a family man. 
Throughout ''She Hate Me'' you can sense Mr. Lee trying to do the right thing. But in spite of itself, the movie supports the adolescent caveman fantasy that a lesbian is really a heterosexual woman who hasn't received proper stud service. 
''She Hate Me'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes, simulated sex, nudity, and profanity.

‽The Bourne Supremacy‽,‽It may sound odd to call a chilly, paranoid thriller like ''The Bourne Supremacy'' entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11, this globe-trotting post-cold-war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal served while riding the world's smoothest roller coaster. 
As the story unfolds at a whirring pace whose tremors flow like the seamless pulses in a sleek, percussive symphony, watching the movie feels like lying back after the meat loaf and mashed potatoes and being spoon-fed gourmet ice cream while the wind whistles in your ears. 
There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies and moles from Russia and the United States tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. Nor are there flashy computerized embellishments or martial arts stunts. This is high-speed action realism carried off with the dexterity of a magician pulling a hundred rabbits out of a hat in one graceful gesture. The crowning flourish is an extended car chase through the streets and tunnels of Moscow that ranks as one of the three or four most exciting demolition derbies ever filmed. 
In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned. Doug Liman, the original director, is now an executive producer, and Paul Greengrass (who oversaw the docudrama ''Bloody Sunday'') has taken over as director. The screenwriter Tony Gilroy is back, as are the cinematographer Oliver Wood and the composer John Powell. 
Crouched in the eye of the storm once again is Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, Jason spends almost the entire movie, which opens today nationwide, on the run. 
The character, created by the novelist Robert Ludlum, is so resourceful that he might be described as Superman With Partial Amnesia. One of his favorite tricks is to call the people he's spying on and describe what he is observing through his telescopic lens. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. 
Other returning cast members include Franka Potente as Jason's sweetheart, Marie (her appearance is brief), and Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Gabriel Mann as C.I.A. agents of varying rank. ''The Bourne Supremacy,'' like its predecessor, is not C.I.A.-friendly. In the light of recent headlines, that skepticism lends it an extra frisson of credibility. 
In a movie in which most of the dialogue consists of curt exclamations, Jason may amount to little more than an embattled cipher. But Mr. Damon, who has shed much of his boyish ingenuousness (he is beginning to suggest the grown-up Robert Wagner), plays him as a cunning escape artist and technophile, with lightning reflexes as well as a streak of sadness. 
The actor's masklike features suit his chameleonic character, but in the rare moments that his face softens, there is the suggestion that he will be the loneliest man in the world the moment that he stops running. The trickle of emotion leaking through his pressurized stress lends the movie an emotional undertone subtly accented by the weary sighs in Mr. Powell's otherwise propulsive score. 
The story begins in Goa, India, where Jason and Marie hide until the arrival of a killer (Karl Urban), dispatched by a Russian oil mogul (Karel Roden), abruptly ends their idyll. At the same time, the C.I.A. is investigating the murder of two agents in Berlin, where a glaring fingerprint left at the scene of the crime points to Jason. 
This time, a C.I.A. deputy, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), pressures her boss, Ward Abbott (Mr. Cox), to reopen a case that was closed two years earlier and bring Jason down. In short order, a C.I.A. team led by Ms. Allen descends on Berlin. As usual, this actress is just about perfect: crisp but not frozen. Meanwhile, Jason's flight takes him from Goa to Naples to Berlin to Moscow as he eludes and battles one assassin after another. 
As an action-movie travelogue, ''The Bourne Supremacy'' is unusually evocative. From its beaches of Goa to Berlin's clotted skyline to Moscow in the snow, its city lights glowing, it imparts a glamorized sense of tourism under duress. 
Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a movie that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride in which every curve and dip is calculated. Where most Hollywood action movies, edited within an inch of their lives, use split-second leaps and flashes as visual jolts to camouflage holes, ''The Bourne Supremacy'' knows what it's doing. Its relentless speed not only puts you in Jason's shoes by suggesting the adrenaline rush of a fugitive who has no time to look around, but also suggests Jason's quick thinking. If you pay close attention, you won't get lost. And even if you do, it doesn't take away from the fun. 
''The Bourne Supremacy'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for scenes of violence.

‽
‽What Is It?‽,‽For more than 20 years, Crispin Glover, actor, has maintained a truly distinctive, oddball persona, existing on his own plane. Unsurprisingly, his directorial debut, "What Is It?" — which plays as part of a double bill with a live, enthusiastically performed slide show in which Mr. Glover displays pages from his recent series of books — is just as unclassifiable as he is. (The film and slide show play tonight through Sunday night at the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village.) 
Unsettling and often quite absurd, his labor of love, almost 10 years in the making, is predominantly inhabited by people with Down syndrome, whose dialogue is often indecipherable. There is also a person with cerebral palsy; three naked women with monkey faces (played by pornographic-film stars); a menacing Shirley Temple doll; Mr. Glover himself, as the apparent ruler of an underworld freak show; numerous  snails; and a man in blackface who injects the snails' slime in hopes of becoming one. What is it indeed. 
There's no point in mentioning plot, as there doesn't seem to be one. Very little connects the characters, some of whom may double as one another's psyches, and their actions, which range from sexually graphic to just plain repellent. (Snails, and people, are killed regularly.) 
Some will deem Mr. Glover a brave visionary unafraid to deliver a kick in the teeth to Hollywood or to address society's discomfort with the handicapped. Others will find him to be a reckless exploiter intent solely on making audiences squirm. Either way, Crispin Hellion Glover, auteur, is a force to be reckoned with. (Two more installments are to follow.) 
WHAT IS IT? 
Opens today in Manhattan.  
Written, directed and edited by Crispin Hellion Glover; director of photography, Wyatt Troll; art director, Floyd Albee; produced by Mr. Glover, Matt Devlen and Ryan Page.

‽
‽See No Evil‽,‽Whether pursuing acting careers or state governorships, professional wrestlers generally fare better with a minimum of dialogue. The makers of "See No Evil" understand this, allotting their star, Kane (a k a Glen Jacobs), a mere handful of syllables to play Jacob Goodnight, a lumbering psychopath holed up in the penthouse of a derelict hotel. 
Resembling nothing so much as a better-exfoliated version of the Thing, Jacob works out his mommy issues by murdering the hapless homeless who wander into his territory. Armed with a meat cleaver and a manicure Barbra Streisand would envy, he excavates their eyeballs and pops them into pickling jars. Yummy. 
When a busload of delinquents from the local detention center arrives at the hotel for cleanup duty, "See No Evil" devolves into an increasingly bloody and creative string of butcherings and impalings. The director, Gregory Dark, and the writer, Dan Madigan, ensure no sympathy for the foulmouthed victims, who spend most of their premutilation time drinking, toking and showering as if auditioning for the Spice Channel. 
Shooting everything with an inebriated camera that bounces off walls, crawls over cockroaches and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the appropriately named Mr. Dark has no use for actors as anything other than body-bag fillers. He does, however, provide us with one of the most inventive cinematic examples of death by cellphone. Parents, please don't try this at home. 
"See No Evil" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for soft-core sex and drugs, hard-core language and violence, and simply dreadful family values.

‽
‽Grizzly Man‽,‽One rainy afternoon in the Alaskan wilderness two years ago, a self-made man named Timothy Treadwell was  mauled and eaten by a grizzly bear. It may be that the animal, a scrawny male about 28 years old and 1,000 pounds, was trying to fatten up in preparation for its winter's sleep. As it happens, Treadwell, who achieved minor celebrity as an expert on grizzlies, publishing a book on the bears and jousting with David Letterman on late-night television, had pitched his tent in a feeding ground. The call of the wild was as irresistible to Treadwell as his flesh proved to be to that bear. 
The strange story of Timothy Treadwell, a Long Island native who came to see himself as some kind of ursine Dr. Dolittle, only to die at 46 from a bear attack,  is the subject of "Grizzly Man," the latest documentary from Werner Herzog. As fans of the German New Wave know, the director has a fondness for stories about men who journey into the heart of darkness, both without and within - men like the deranged 16th-century explorer in "Aguirre, the Wrath of God," who searches for El Dorado in the Amazon, and the early-20th-century esthete in "Fitzcarraldo" who hauls a steamboat up a mountain  to bring Caruso to the Peruvian jungle. Treadwell's journey was no less bold or reckless than these earlier Herzogian tales and certainly no less enthralling. 
Mr. Herzog has been making documentaries for more than three decades, about as long as he has been directing fiction films, but he is not part of any nonfiction tradition. In a statement on his Web site, wernerherzog.com, he declares: "By dint of declaration the so-called cinéma vérité is devoid of vérité. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants." This is a rather crude  attempt to separate himself from the nonfiction crowd, but Mr. Herzog is also no ordinary filmmaker. It is the rare documentary like "Grizzly Man," which has  beauty and passion often lacking in any type of film, that makes you want to grab its maker and head off to the nearest bar to discuss man's domination of nature and how Disney's cute critters reflect our profound alienation from the natural order. 
Beauty enters first in "Grizzly Man," which opens with two bears  grazing on a spectacular stretch of green in the Katmai National Park and Preserve, a nearly five-million-acre swath on the Alaska Peninsula. Dressed in black, his  pageboy stirring in the wind, Treadwell walks into the frame and introduces the grizzlies as Ed and Rowdy. "They're challenging everything, including me," he says as the bears munch away. "If I show weakness, if I retreat, I may be hurt, I may be killed. I must hold my own if I am going to stay within this land. For once there is weakness, they will exploit it, they will take me out, they will decapitate me, they will chop me into bits and pieces. I'm dead. But so far, I persevere,  persevere." 
It is a typical Treadwell recitation - sincere, grandiose and intensely worrisome - a bit of bravura that ends with the self-designated "kind warrior" blowing a kiss and signing off like Kojak: "Love you, Rowdy." Even if you don't know that Treadwell was killed along with his girlfriend, a physician's assistant named Amie Huguenard, his familiarity with, and proximity to, the bears bodes badly, for him and for them. There is something surreal (at least to a committed urbanite) about anyone who would talk to these animals, especially a guy whose blond, bland good looks made him seem like an aging surfer, a kind of Spicoli of the backwoods. But as Mr. Herzog points out in his online manifesto, "facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable." 
Despite some early bumps, Treadwell started off as an average sort.  After an injury put an end to an athletic scholarship, he moved to (where else?) Southern California. There he did the usual bumming around, but his life  soured and, according to his book, "Among Grizzlies," written with Jewel Palovak, he suffered a near-fatal drug overdose. Scared straight, he gradually reinvented himself, and by the early 1990's was summering in Katmai, home to about  2,000 grizzlies. Mr. Herzog lays out this history in voice-over, illustrating Treadwell's ups and downs through the spectacular videos the amateur naturalist shot and interviews with the dead man's family and friends. The filmmaker also taps the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on Treadwell and Huguenard, Dr. Franc G. Fallico, a character around whom an entire reality show could be built. 
Dr. Fallico pops up a couple of times in "Grizzly Man," but the most potent use of his testimony occurs when he expounds  at length in an autopsy room, a scene that illustrates Mr. Herzog's sense of drama beautifully. Sporting a blue smock and a fixed gaze, Dr. Fallico recounts his version of the attack, a  description based on his examination of the bodies and the six-minute audio record found on one of Treadwell's video cameras. (The lens cap was on the camera.) The account is graphic, gruesome and thoroughly riveting, partly because morbid tales always tug at the imagination, but also because Dr. Fallico turns out to be an incredible storyteller. For Mr. Herzog, it's clear that the truth of this story isn't located just in the facts that the doctor strings together with florid gestures and pregnant pauses, but in a performance that is as artful as it is true. 
Treadwell's adventures among his beloved grizzlies were also a kind of performance, built on lies and truth and played out on the stage of celebrity. Even though his choices were dangerous and finally fatal, he traveled a familiar American path shaped by boundless optimism and an almost religious belief in the self. He lived among grizzlies because he believed that he could. Given this, the cheap shots that followed his death, including the appalling snarkiness that crept  into newspaper headlines ("Grizzly bear that killed pair attacked at lunchtime"), are revelatory. For some, Treadwell's death confirmed that animal activists and environmentalists are dangerous wackos; for others, though, his unhappy end may have suggested something equally disturbing: sometimes a smile and  American goodwill aren't enough. 
Throughout "Grizzly Man," men and women pay testament to Treadwell's niceness and naïveté. Some are kind; others less so. Each testifier seems to capture some authentic quality of Treadwell, who from the evidence of his videos and Mr. Herzog's sympathetic inquiry, seemed equally nice and naïve, brave and foolish. At some point that foolishness mushroomed into a welter of delusions about his power to survive the wilderness in which he so recklessly tried to find himself. His death, as inevitable as it was preventable, could mean that he may have been more lost than found. Mr. Herzog remains generous to a fault on this particular point, perhaps because he recognizes that for someone like Treadwell, there is nothing more terrifying than being ordinary, even the claws of a grizzly. 
"Grizzly Man" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some adult language and vivid descriptions of a bear mauling.

‽
‽Stealth‽,‽The sight of Jessica Biel wiggling her shapely rear through the North Korean backcountry in the action flick "Stealth" isn't the most ludicrous image of our current movie season, but it comes close. As it happens, the most preposterous moment in this preposterous crypto-video game occurs after Ms. Biel's character, a United States naval pilot, parachutes from her stealth aircraft through a hailstorm of fiery debris, races across North Korea while chased by thugs with guns, and rushes into the arms of the man who risks worldwide nuclear holocaust to rescue her. Thanks, dude! 
A hash of "Top Gun" and "Behind Enemy Lines," among myriad other influences, and topped with a soupçon of "2001," this story of three comrades up against a villainous miscellany has the makings of a kitsch classic. Any film that places romance above Armageddon and forces a fine actor like Josh Lucas to parade around in a swimsuit like a model for International Male would certainly seem to have the appropriate wrong stuff. Too bad that the screenwriter W. D. Richter and the director Rob Cohen, who has almost extinguished all the good will he built up from "The Fast and the Furious," don't seem in on the joke. Nor do members of  the cast, which includes Jamie Foxx and Sam Shepard, crack many smiles, despite the inherent hilarity of the material. 
Set in the very near future during, as an opening scroll explains, the "mounting threat of terrorism," the story hinges on three stealth pilots - Ms. Biel's Kara, Mr. Lucas's Ben and Mr. Foxx's improbably named Henry Purcell - who zip around the globe putting out fires, fanning flames and swapping chummy barbs with Mr. Shepard's commanding officer. The pilots get along splendidly, but bashful Kara and flirty Ben look as if they would like to do more than pal around. Hence Mr. Lucas and Ms. Biel's swimsuit duet during a pointless sojourn in Thailand, an exotic backdrop for the usual military R&amp;R (beautiful locals with negligible English skills, etc.) and the only foreign country that these happy three visit and don't shoot up. 
One of the pleasures of entertainments like the Bond films is that they work as a sort of travelogue, taking us places we've never been  (or at least to convincing facsimiles) and opening us to the world. Not so "Stealth," which, other than that Thailand layover, inspires no such wanderlust. The reason isn't that the film was mostly shot in Australia, which almost always looks inviting; rather, it's that almost every locale gets blown to bits almost as soon as the pilots come within shooting distance. Among the less fortunate territories: Myanmar, Tajikistan, North Korea and a corner of Alaska, all of which come under intense fire. 
It's no wonder that in "Stealth" the planet usually looks better from 35,000 feet above ground, a vantage point that makes everything - including people, who alternately look like ants and characters in a video game - seem awfully distant and terribly unreal. 
What's interesting about "Stealth" isn't its nitwit story, which largely involves a next-generation aircraft operated by a computer with a voice meant to evoke HAL 9000 that sounds more like an interminably snotty hotel clerk right before a phone bounces off his head. No, what's interesting about this movie - and many others of its kind - is that it continues the love affair Hollywood, that hotbed of liberalism, has long had with militarism. As is almost always the case in these movies, the fall guy here turns out to be a rogue bad apple who, though abetted by black-bag types and a shadowy politician, is lodged in an otherwise unsullied bushel of warriors. Like Kara, these boys fret about collateral damage, but are more obsessed with big bangs than little people. 
 
"Stealth" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lot of explosions, a number of bloodless deaths and some adult language.

‽
‽Bewitched‽,‽Once upon a television time, when witches, genies and homemaker vampires ruled the roost, the war of the sexes was as cute as the button nose on Elizabeth Montgomery's face. As the star of the dimwitted delight "Bewitched," Ms. Montgomery wiggled her protuberance at a husband whose bumbling ways turned a topical power struggle into the stuff of canned laughter. 
For some, 1964 is fondly remembered as the year President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a civil rights act, barring sex discrimination in the workplace, as well as the year Ms. Montgomery materialized as the gauzily sexy witch Samantha. 
"Bewitched" is now a big-screen movie with Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell and a nicely tuned supporting cast. Because the ethereally beautiful Ms. Kidman no longer resembles a real person, having been buffed to almost supernatural perfection in the way of most modern stars, casting her as a witch was inspired. 
Equally clever is the film's core conceit, which finds her playing Isabel Bigelow, a reluctant witch who is  cast as Samantha in a remake of the original sitcom. Anxious to leave behind the world of spells and (especially, it seems) warlocks, Isabel yearns for the simple life, much as Eddie Albert did when he moved next door to a pig on "Green Acres." Instead, the witch becomes a star. 
This multisituational silliness is agreeably watchable for an hour. Isabel, having made a vow to go on the witchcraft wagon, settles into a dream of a house complete with a white picket fence, a garlanded lawn and a tortoise-shell cat. Much like other cultural aliens, both extraterrestrial and those fresh off the boat, sweet Isabel is charmingly overwhelmed by her new world. 
She relishes the idea of shopping like a mere mortal but doesn't give any thought to how to pay for her groceries. And when she tries to hook up the cable, she (understandably) turns on the charms. It's no wonder that her father, Nigel (Michael Caine), casts a skeptical eye at his daughter; he seems to know that relinquishing your power is no easy thing. 
These early scenes unfold smoothly, and it appears that the director, Nora Ephron, who wrote the screenplay with her sister, Delia Ephron, gave some thought to what it might be like to be a witch who suddenly has to live in the human world. 
It's pleasant just to watch Ms. Kidman float through the movie's sets like a visitor from another land; she's as adorable as E.T., though her voice is as baby-breathy as that of Marilyn Monroe. Ms. Kidman has of late become perhaps overly fond of speaking in such undertones (it makes you wonder if she permanently strained her vocal cords), but here the kittenish delivery adds a crucial softness, a sense of comfort, that doesn't come naturally to this actress. 
During the first years of "Bewitched," Ms. Montgomery was one of the era's stealth vixens, a woman whose alert eyes darted under the cover of unthreatening blondeness. Unlike Lucy Ricardo, from whose canyon mouth flowed a river of complaint (and whose restlessness always felt somehow tragic), Samantha really did seem like the girl next door who was happy to become the model wife. 
The great joke of "Bewitched" was that unlike Lucy, Samantha had enormous power but kept it in check to placate her husband, unless it served her purposes. It's a sign of the times - and perhaps of the fact that women wrote, directed and produced this film - that Samantha's surrendering her power in a marriage no longer seems as believable as her becoming a celebrity. 
The story, such as it is, kicks in when the movie star Jack Wyatt (a relatively unplugged Will Ferrell) tries to kick-start a faltering career by starring in a television redo of "Bewitched." Because he's playing Darrin, the witch's genially hapless husband, Jack angles for an unknown as Samantha, the better to hog all the limelight. 
He ends up with Ms. Kidman's Isabel ostensibly because not a single woman in Los Angeles's vast reservoir of acting talent can wiggle her nose like Elizabeth Montgomery. Yet Isabel is also cute, easily improvises with Jack about witch dos and don'ts (you need a permit for a poisoned apple and so forth) and looks mighty fine on camera, which temporarily works against her when she tests better than Jack with the audience. 
Ms. Kidman and Mr. Ferrell are not an intuitive match, and the romantic side of the story is both half-hearted and half-baked. But this self-contained actress has rarely come across as relaxed in the company of another performer. 
For his part, Mr. Ferrell enjoys a few ticklishly funny moments with Ms. Kidman and Jason Schwartzman, playing his sycophant manager. And the sight (and sounds) of his biking onto the set while loudly singing his own name has comic tang, as does a more developed scene in which Jack pretends he's insufferably pampered. Mr. Ferrell looks more streamlined than he has in the past, perhaps in concession to the story's low-wattage romance, but Nora Ephron's attempts to turn him into Tom Hanks Lite are unfortunate. 
Best known for screenplays like "When Harry Met Sally" and for bowdlerizing Lubitsch's "Shop Around the Corner" with her execrable "You've Got Mail," Ms. Ephron is one of those directors whose work is only as good as her cast and crew. Outside of the performers there isn't much to look at here, but given the cavalcade of supporting characters there are some distractions, including Shirley MacLaine, Heather Burns and Stephen Colbert. Along with the two stars, they keep the film in gear until it hits the hour mark, whereupon it dies. (Steve Carell, doing Paul Lynde doing Uncle Arthur, provides some late relief.) 
The film's screenwriters conjured up a very clever gimmick when they decided to revamp a favorite 60's television show. Too bad they forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. 
"Bewitched" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film is pretty tame, though as is his onscreen wont, Mr. Ferrell does go partly bare for one scene.

‽
‽Melinda and Melinda‽,‽The new Woody Allen movie, "Melinda and Melinda," is framed, somewhat in the manner of "Broadway Danny Rose," by table talk. Lingering over dinner at Pastis, four marvelously articulate New Yorkers debate the interpretation of an anecdote, unheard by the audience, involving an unhappy young woman named Melinda. 
Two of the diners happen to be playwrights - perhaps the only two left in New York who could afford to eat at such a restaurant, but never mind - and one of them, a maker of serious dramas (Larry Pine) sees the story as a tragedy, while the other, a cherubic author of comedies (Wallace Shawn), claims it for his own preferred genre. 
That the tragedian turns out to have a sunnier view of life than his colleague is part of the film's point: in life and in art, funny often keeps close company with sad, to the extent that it is sometimes hard to distinguish one from the other. Mr. Allen does not make it much easier. 
As he interweaves two versions of the Melinda story, one meant to be bathed in pathos, the other sprinkled with whimsy, it becomes apparent that his notions of comedy and tragedy do not quite correspond either to scholarly dogma or to everyday usage. You might, for instance, expect the tragic tale to purge your unruly emotions through pity and terror, rather than through bafflement and ennui. You might also expect the comic half of the movie to be funny, in which case the joke is on you. 
The link between the two asymmetrical stories is Radha Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both, surrounded in each case by a different supporting cast. The distinction between comedy and tragedy comes down, ultimately, to her: if she is wild-haired, fretfully smoking and overacting like a contestant in the Jennifer Jason Leigh category on "American Idol," then it must be tragedy. If, on the other hand, her hair is neatly bobbed and her manner ingenue-fresh, then comedy is the name of the game. 
In both renderings, she crashes a dinner party with an air of distress and a tale of woe, and her arrival sets off a chain of marital misunderstanding and emotional collision that swirls through subsequent parties and further dinners in charming Manhattan restaurants. 
The tragic Melinda barges in on some old friends - Laurel (Chloë Sevigny), a Park Avenue trust-fund baby, and her husband, Lee (Jonny Lee Miller), an intermittently employed actor with a bit of a drinking problem. This Melinda arrives demanding single malt Scotch and brandishing a florid life story that includes a bitter divorce, an unhappy love affair and a suicide attempt. (An even darker chapter is revealed later on.) 
Her comic counterpart, whose misery is less Gothic, lives downstairs from another couple, an intermittently employed actor named Hobie (Will Ferrell) and his wife, Susan (Amanda Peet), an independent filmmaker. In both scenarios, Melinda's presence stirs up latent instabilities within her friends' marriages and causes some upheaval in their social and professional lives. 
Not that the two plots are exactly parallel, though they are connected by ingeniously placed details and motifs. In the comedy, Hobie falls in love with Melinda, while in the tragedy she and Laurel become rivals for the affections of a gallant pianist and composer with the extraordinary name of Ellis Moonsong, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor ("Love, Actually," "Dirty Pretty Things"). 
Mr. Ejiofor's presence, along with that of Daniel Sunjata in a smaller, similar role in the film's comic half, is perhaps the biggest shock in "Melinda and Melinda." In the fifth decade of his career as a New York filmmaker, Mr. Allen has written not one but two black characters into a movie, without sensationalism or stereotyping. Better late than never, I suppose. 
In every other respect, though, Mr. Allen's Manhattan remains a fantasy world, which is both a serious limitation and a minor source of delight. By now, there is nothing to be gained from complaining about the inaccuracies and anachronisms that color his view of the city or the strange, stilted idioms its inhabitants use in his films. It is better to appreciate him as a kind of preservationist, carefully restoring a cultural niche where the hectic elegance of old studio comedies and serious Broadway plays might still flourish amid the vulgar madcap of the 21st-century metropolis. 
"Melinda and Melinda" is perhaps best thought of as an offering to the memories of Ernst Lubitsch and George S. Kaufman, half-forgotten culture heroes whose examples of crisp sophistication deserve to be kept alive for future generations. 
Mr. Allen pries his actors away from their naturalistic habits, evoking a pre-Method style of performance that has all but vanished from the modern stage and screen. The results are mixed. Ms. Sevigny, Mr. Ejiofor and Ms. Peet seem liberated, freed of the necessity to plumb psychological depths and able to explore behavior rather than motive. Mr. Miller, struggling with an underwritten part and a badly fitting accent, has a harder time, as does Mr. Ferrell, who is miscast in the Woody Allen surrogate role of soulful schlemiel. 
Mr. Ferrell, with his large, shambling body and bland features, is hardly the ideal mouthpiece for the jittery, hostile one-liners that afflict Mr. Allen's writing like a tic. Coming into a pretentiously decorated vacation house in the Hamptons, Mr. Ferrell seems much more likely to trip over the furniture than to insult it, and Mr. Allen grudgingly allows him a single moment of physical comedy, involving a bathrobe that gets stuck in a door. 
Which brings me to the real reason to appreciate Mr. Allen, which is as an unrivaled pornographer. I'm not talking about sex; there is some bed-hopping in "Melinda and Melinda," but the camera always stops at the bedroom door. These days, in any case, the kind of New Yorkers likely to see a Woody Allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate, and the long hallways, high ceilings and open kitchens on display in this movie are likely to keep local audiences sighing and moaning for the full 99 minutes. 
To make the fantasy even more delicious and indecent, these apartments are inhabited by struggling actors, filmmakers and musicians who amusingly complain about being broke when the combined market value of their property could finance another installation of "The Gates." Which is, come to think of it, both funny and sad. 
"Melinda and Melinda" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has many sexual references and situations, and some off-color language.

‽
‽Are We There Yet?‽,‽Since he burst "Straight Outta Compton" on the record of that name in 1988, Ice Cube (born O'Shea Jackson) has gone through multiple incarnations as an entertainer, from the controversial front man for the rap group N.W.A. to film roles as the self-destructive gang member in "Boyz N the Hood" and the genial stoner in "Friday" and its sequels (of which he is also co-writer and co-producer). In the "Barbershop" films of recent years, Ice Cube began to reinvent his on-screen persona as a warmhearted family man. In the new comedy "Are We There Yet?," he takes that persona from PG-13 to PG territory, focusing on a new demographic of preteenage fans. 
Ice Cube plays Nick Persons, the easygoing owner of a sports memorabilia shop in Portland, Ore. Nick is a bachelor and confirmed ladies' man who hates children the way Ebenezer Scrooge hates Christmas: as a matter of principle. But when he casts his eye on a luscious divorced woman named Suzanne (Nia Long), he is forced to reconsider his antichild policy. 
Unfortunately for Nick, Suzanne's two children, 11-year-old Lindsey and 8-year-old Kevin (Aleisha Allen and Philip Daniel Bolden), have vowed to sabotage their mother's suitors by any means necessary, including booby-trapping the front doorstep with a carpet of slippery marbles. So Nick courts Suzanne while steering clear of the two terrors until, stuck in Vancouver on a business trip, Suzanne asks him to take the youngsters up for a visit. 
Their journey is predictably star-crossed: luggage is lost, planes missed and cars wrecked and abandoned, until finally Nick is chasing the children on horseback as they stow away on a boxcar. The inexorable logic of breakdown and disintegration in "Are We There Yet?" is the best thing about it; like the John Hughes comedy "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," it posits travel as a Dante-esque ordeal in which the hell of the transportation system serves as a gateway to the paradise of love and family. By the time the battle-scarred Nick and his charges arrive in Vancouver, he has become the children's de facto father. 
Though the presence of the always charismatic Ice Cube makes "Are We There Yet?" watchable, the movie suffers from one insurmountable problem: as scripted by a too-many-cooks screenwriting team and cloyingly played by the young actors, little Lindsey and Kevin are such insufferable brats that the hero's change of heart remains a mystery. As Nick goes from despising his young charges to dandling them on his knee, viewers are likely to experience the same process in reverse; the children are so relentlessly shrill, their behavior so dreadful and consequence-free, that childless viewers of "Are We There Yet?" (who, to be fair, are likely to be few) may find themselves rethinking their stance on reproduction. 
"Are We There Yet?" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It contains mild profanity and a few bodily fluid-related jokes.

‽Mughal-E-Azam‽,‽NEW DELHI, India, Aug. 5—The brighter side of Indian life was dazzling tonight. The reason was the gala premiere in more than 200 theatres throughout the country of "Mughal-Azan" (the Great Mughal Ruler). It is billed as the greatest film extravaganza in years.For the Indian people, who are yet to get their first glimpse of television, this three-hour fifteen-minute saga of the sixteenth-century Moslem empire of Akbar the Great is just the escape from modern hardships that they crave. When seats went on sale at six Delhi theatres two weeks ago, the police were called to quell near riots.The film, produced in Bombay, is said to have cost 10,500,000 rupees ($2,250,000) and to have taken ten years to make.

‽Saving Marriage‽,‽An in-the-trenches, defiantly partisan and exuberantly big-hearted movie, “Saving Marriage” documents the Massachusetts imbroglio over same-sex unions with moving candor and unflagging spirits. 
When the Massachusetts Supreme Court declared the ban on gay marriage unconstitutional in 2003, the immediate backlash soon coalesced into a proposed constitutional amendment to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. Chronicling the battle to defeat that amendment, the directors, Mike Roth and John Henning, intercut tense political skirmishes with the emotional journey of a young lesbian couple whose relationship has been profoundly affected by these events. 
Defined by swells of success and troughs of despondency, the legal tussle is engrossing and sometimes revelatory; but it’s in the small, personal moments that “Saving Marriage” breaks through. When the gay rights lobbyist Arline Isaacson frets that a lifetime of discrimination may have sapped the self-esteem necessary for her supporters to defeat the amendment, or when the gay, newly elected state representative Carl Sciortino balks at publicly hugging his male supporters, the movie achieves a rare eloquence. The roots of puritanism run deep, but they’re far from invisible. 
Rambunctious and hopeful, “Saving Marriage” asks us to re-examine an institution  and a word  most of us take for granted. By the end, we may feel that saying “I do” is no different than saying “I am.” 
"Saving Marriage" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Homophobic language.

‽10 Questions for the Dalai Lama‽,‽When the filmmaker Rick Ray arrived in India to direct a travel video, an interview with the Dalai Lama was supposed to be part of his compensation. When he discovered that he would have to arrange it himself, he did, by e-mail. 
The result is “10 Questions for the Dalai Lama,” a tedious title for an anything-but-tedious film. Expertly merging the mystical and the mundane, Mr. Ray presents a warm and well-rounded portrait of his subject, his Buddhist philosophies and the painful circumstances of his exile to a modest monastery in Dharamsala, India. 
Though it touches on Tibet and China’s discordant political history (with amazing archival film and an interview with a former Chinese political prisoner), the movie is more charmed by the Dalai Lama’s personality than by his politics. 
Impish, self-deprecating and an infectious giggler, he is an unorthodox spiritual exemplar with an insatiable scientific curiosity. (“When science contradicts faith, he’s prone to choose science,” Mr. Ray marvels.) This 14th incarnation of the Dalai Lama would rather be reading about neuroscience than enduring a festival in his honor. 
As for Mr. Ray’s questions, his interviewee doesn’t hold back, whether discussing his environmentalism or the outmoded Indian caste system. He even ventures onto the thin ice of birth control. 
“Quality is more important than quantity!” is his emphatic opinion. Mother Teresa might have had something to say about that.

‽The Real Dirt on Farmer John‽,‽"What do you do when nothing is left?" is the question that drives "The Real Dirt on Farmer John," Taggart Siegel's fascinating documentary about loss and reinvention. If you're John Peterson, the progressive Illinois farmer whom Mr. Siegel filmed through 25 years of friendship and multiple crises, you pick yourself up and start again — with the camera running, of course. 
An amiable rebel who likes to taste his soil and drive his tractor while wearing a feather boa, Mr. Peterson — who also wrote and narrates the film — has always lived in front of a lens. From the home movies shot by  his mother to Mr. Siegel's epic attentions, the wildly fluctuating fortunes of the Peterson family farm provide the backdrop to a life driven as much by art as by agriculture. 
And as 1960s wiener roasts give way to frolicking '70s hippies and the farm auctions of the '80s (captured in Mr. Siegel's first documentary, "Bitter Harvest"), the movie becomes a palimpsest of images depicting the struggle between tradition and modernity. 
Firmly anchored by its protagonist's love of the land, "The Real Dirt on Farmer John" offers one man's extraordinary life as a gateway to a larger history of tragedy and transition. It's an unflinching account of what farming takes — and, more important, what it gives back.

‽
‽G.I. Jesus‽,‽This feature by Carl Colpaert, who wrote and directed, may be a mixed bag, but it is so impressive in so many ways that it demands to be taken seriously. It's a black comedy about a returning Iraq war veteran named Jesús (Joe  Arquette) that aims for an absurd, satirical tone (think "Dr. Strangelove" by way of "Coming Home") but rarely hits the mark. 
Some of the scenes between Jesús and his flirty, materialistic wife, Claudia (Patricia Mota), and their precocious daughter (Telana Lynum) are too didactically conceived, though they do boast culturally specific details rarely seen in American movies. For instance, the décor in the family's trailer home mixes traditional, seemingly antique Mexican furniture and artwork and junky modern consumer goods. 
Throughout, the film's writing is too emphatic, some of its devices are corny (particularly an Iraqi apparition played by Maurizio Farhad, who engages Jesús in Socratic dialogues about wartime violence), and its likable performances a bit wobbly in places, as if the actors weren't quite sure what was expected of them. But the film offers other pleasures, most of them visual and rhythmic. 
Chief among these is Mr. Colpaert's daring structure, reminiscent of later David Lynch films like "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Drive" — movies in which the story is told with so many odd flourishes that you aren't quite sure you can trust it, and then it literally becomes a different movie. Mr. Colpaert gets away with this by putting us inside Jesús's head from the start and making the whole onscreen world a projection of his upbringing and personality. (He's an immigrant Mexican-American Roman Catholic who longs to assimilate and who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.) 
The film's most striking element is the interweaving of grainy green night-vision imagery into Jesús's everyday existence. It's such a clever visualization of wartime trauma infecting postwar life that it's bound to be ripped off by movies with bigger budgets and less serious ambitions. 
"G.I. Jesús" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sex, nudity and violence.

‽Black Christmas‽,‽It’s been more than 30 years since the original “Black Christmas,” directed by Bob Clark from a script by Roy Moore, revealed how much fun — and how economical — it could be to unleash a psycho in a sorority house. Filled with shifting perspectives, ingenious tracking shots and a memorable performance from Margot Kidder as the sorority slut, the movie virtually invented the slasher film and inspired genre classics like “When a Stranger Calls” and “Halloween.” 
Glen Morgan’s disastrous remake not only sidelines the original’s hilariously obscene phone calls but also drags its unseen killer, and his psychoses, into the light. Burdened with a murdered father, a grotesquely abusive mother and the fruits of an incestuous teenage quickie in the  attic, as well as a  bad case of jaundice, this killer can barely muster the energy to pick off his indistinguishably bland victims. Recast as the star instead of the creep on the other end of the phone, he blunders around, chewing on eyeballs and shrinking from the camera’s attention. He’s about as scary as the family dog. 
With a peephole-riddled set and a flashback-heavy screenplay, “Black Christmas” smothers terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, revealing too much and teasing too little. And despite some nifty camerawork — a shot of an asylum inmate gobbling Christmas dinner cuts seamlessly to a couple snogging in a car — the movie is a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor. Ms. Kidder, we miss you. 
“Black Christmas” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has bloody sex, bloody murder and bloody Christmas ornaments.

‽The Good Shepherd‽,‽“The Good Shepherd,” a chilly film about a spy trapped in the cold of his own heart, seeks to put a tragic human face on the Central Intelligence Agency, namely that of Matt Damon. The story more or less begins and ends at the Bay of Pigs. In between there is a spicy, lively interlude in the 1930’s at Yale University, where little boys are made of skull and bones and secret societies. Yale leads to World War II, cloak and dagger and a British spy cut from the same bespoke cloth as Kim Philby. Then it’s over to Washington, where the citadels of power loom against the cheerless sky like tombstones. 
Mr. Damon, who plays a super-spy warrior in the “Bourne” films, excels at secretive men, and few are as mysterious as Edward Wilson, the spy catcher in “The Good Shepherd.” (The title refers to the Bible passage in which Jesus says: “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”) Though a composite,  Wilson seems largely based on the fascinating, freakishly paranoid James Jesus Angleton, a Yale graduate and poetry lover who served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and ran C.I.A. counterintelligence from 1954 to 1974.  Mr. Angleton cultivated orchids; Wilson builds the more prosaically symbolic miniature ships in bottles. 
Mr. Angleton is now widely thought to have hurt the C.I.A. more than he helped it, and articles on the agency’s Web site (cia.gov) frame his tenure in generally unfavorable terms (it had “devastating results,” for one). Written by Eric Roth and directed by Robert De Niro, “The Good Shepherd” doesn’t address the full consequences of that devastation, partly because it wants to take on the institution as well as the man, and partly, one imagines, because Mr. Angleton’s crippling paranoia would have been too difficult to shape into a neat narrative. “The Good Shepherd” is an origin story about the C.I.A., and for the filmmakers that story boils down to fathers who fail their sons, a suspect metaphor that here becomes all too ploddingly literal. 
Certainly fathers and sons offer a serviceable alternative to martinis and Aston Martins. Created in 1947, the C.I.A. has been responsible for many deeds, including our abiding fascination with spooks. No matter which way public sentiment shifts about the agency and its handiwork (Chile, Nicaragua), we remain fascinated with spies, or at least an idea of them, an idea in which matchbox cameras and microphones invariably figure more prominently than miles of locked filing cabinets. Secrets make agencies like the C.I.A. sexy, no matter how rumpled the raincoats. The most interesting thing about “The Good Shepherd” is how hard the filmmakers work not only to demystify the agency, but also to strip it of its allure, its heat. 
In “Betrayal,” a book about Aldrich Ames,  the double agent who for years ferried C.I.A. secrets to the Soviets, the agency is characterized as “a cross between Yale’s secret Skull and Bones society and the post office.” In its basic outline Mr. Roth’s overly busy screenplay takes the same approach to the agency as it follows Wilson’s journey through institutions of power. At Yale he joins the Skull and Bones, where the power elite helps reproduce itself by bonding and dressing like the orgiastic partygoers in “Eyes Wide Shut.” The all-male members of this clandestine group don’t have sex with one another, at least on screen, but they do mud-wrestle naked, a ritual that underscores the homosocial nature of Wilson’s world. 
Yale and World War II are the juiciest bits of the story, partly because they involve the charismatic Dr. Fredericks, played by a superb Michael Gambon. A Yale professor with a leer as insinuating as his walking stick, Dr. Fredericks tries to seduce Wilson into some antidemocratic chicanery through their shared love of poetry. (At Yale, Mr. Angleton helped found a poetry magazine in which he published Ezra Pound, a family acquaintance.) This attempted seduction parallels a rather more comical one involving Angelina Jolie, who plays Margaret Russell, the sister of  another Yale student. With her poppy-red lipstick and raucously aggressive sexuality, Margaret proves a far more successful seducer than Dr. Fredericks, as female pulchritude and power triumph over manly poetry and secrets. 
Ah, but not for long. This is a man’s world, after all, filled with specters skulking through alleys with blood on their hands and the world on their shoulders. Conscripted into the O.S.S., Wilson travels to London, where he apprentices in espionage and intelligence and meets Arch Cummings (Billy Crudup), a fop with a posh accent patterned on Kim Philby. The film shies away from the more provocative aspects of Mr. Angleton’s long acquaintance with Mr. Philby, and the years they lunched together while Mr. Philby worked for the Soviets. Whatever its true nature, the friendship hurt Mr. Angleton’s marriage, as he later admitted: “Once I met Philby, the world of intelligence that had once interested me consumed me. The home life that had seemed so important faded in importance.” 
That spells trouble for Ms. Jolie, alas, who after her spectacular entrance has to spend most of the film as the aggrieved, abandoned wife. It is not a good fit. A force of nature, Ms. Jolie reads more believably when she’s running through the jungle in boots and a bikini, as she does in the “Tomb Raider” flicks, than when standing on the sidelines in a domestic nightmare. But stand and screech and gamely slosh the booze she does while Mr. Damon’s spy helps win the war and later helps turn the C.I.A. into a shadow empire with some dependable character actors: Mr. De Niro as one of the agency’s founders, the dependably great Alec Baldwin as an F.B.I. agent and an equally fine William Hurt as the pipe-smoking head of the C.I.A. 
Mr. De Niro does fine in his avuncular role and, in the main, even better as the film’s director. He imbues “The Good Shepherd” with a funereal vibe that works especially well on the dark, dank streets of London, where Wilson learns his first repellent lesson in spy-catching, and during his early years in Washington. Among the film’s most striking visual tropes is the image of Wilson simply going to work in the capital alongside other similarly dressed men, a spectral army clutching briefcases and silently marching to uncertain victory. In silhouette the men recall the gangsters in a Jean-Pierre Melville film, even as their anonymity evokes the drones in Madeleine L’Engle’s book “A Wrinkle in Time” who are ruled by an evil disembodied brain called IT. 
Who rules the drones in “The Good Shepherd”? Who is IT? The president, the people, American mining and banana companies, the ghosts of fathers past, the agency itself? It’s hard to know, though now the C.I.A. answers to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. These are hard questions, but they are also too big, too complex and perhaps too painful for even this ambitious (2 hours, 37 minutes) project, which can only elude and insinuate, not enlighten and inform. Although the film seems true in broad outline and scrupulous detail, and the postwar Berlin rubble looks as real as the documentary footage of Fidel Castro slipped between the lightly fictionalized intrigue, there is something ungraspable and unknowable about this world, even if it is also one we ourselves have helped create. 
 “The Good Shepherd” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying  parent or adult guardian). There is some violence, including a scene of torture, as well as adult language and tactful sex.

‽Night at the Museum‽,‽In “Night at the Museum,” gigantism rules. This season’s answer to “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” it’s an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. 
Yes, the bag does hold some clever robotic toys, but many are broken. If you were to line up the niftiest thingamajigs created for this tale of a would-be inventor-turned-night-watchman, you might have something resembling “ ‘Jumanji’ Meets ‘The Wizard of Oz’ With a Dash of ‘Home Alone.’ ” But the fable arrives smothered in an uneasy blend of wisecracks and pallid inspirational blather. 
A self-described action-adventure comedy, “Night at the Museum” is exactly that: it wants to be all things to all people under a certain age. Shawn Levy (“Cheaper by the Dozen,” the “Pink Panther” remake), who directed from Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon’s adaptation of a book by Milan Trenc, subscribes enthusiastically to the current Hollywood philosophy that coherence doesn’t matter if enough stuff is thrown onto the screen. Contributing to the bulk is a score (by Alan Silvestri) that rivals the “Star Wars” soundtracks in pounding grandiosity. 
It’s fair to say that “Night at the Museum” is better than the insufferable Jim Carrey “Grinch,” a landmark of holiday film excess. It knows how to build excitement by steadily accelerating the pace and widening the spectacle. Almost in spite of itself, it sets off occasional little bursts of cinematic magic. 
The movie begins as a droopy family comedy about the divorced, unemployed Larry Daley (Ben Stiller, ably going through the motions), who is so down and out he may have to move from Manhattan to (gasp!) Queens. It quickly builds to a C.G.I. extravaganza unleashed in the halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. There (where the movie wasn’t actually filmed, except for exteriors), its hapless protagonist takes a job as the museum’s night watchman. 
Larry, oblivious to the strange looks on the faces of the three guards he’s replacing — Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) — has no idea what’s awaiting him. No sooner have they departed, handing him the keys with strict instructions that nothing  leave the museum, than the place  stirs to life. In no time Larry is playing frightened ringmaster to a rampaging circus of exhibits that have come to life through the magic of a priceless Egyptian tablet. 
A Tyrannosaurus rex hops off its pedestal and like a famished zombie begins clumping after Larry, who discovers that if he throws it a bone, it fetches like a dog. Cute. A stone head from Easter Island demands bubble gum. And a cheeky monkey named Dexter steals Larry’s keys, tears up his instructions and engages him in a face-slapping routine. 
At first it seems as though the menacing wild animals (both prehistoric and contemporary) will be Larry’s nemeses. But “Night at the Museum” squeezes the most juice from its historical figures, some life-sized, others miniature, some in dioramas and others on pedestals. The most amusing image is of Mr. Stiller, wide-eyed and floppy-eared, besieged by bands of tiny, finger-sized warriors furiously hurling spears and darts at him. 
Of the historical figures, Robin Williams’s Teddy Roosevelt is the noisiest. Once this statue steps off his equestrian roost, he behaves like a bossy, slogan-dispensing drill instructor, whipping Larry into moral shape. But beneath his bluster, the facsimile of the 26th president is an emotional basket case, who admits in a weak moment that he is a synthetic product manufactured in Poughkeepsie. For most of the film, he pines silently after Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck), the famous Indian tracker locked inside the glass case of a Lewis and Clark diorama. 
Profitable screen time is devoted to the continuing territorial squabble between tiny figurines of Octavius (Steve Coogan), the Roman general, and Jedediah (Owen Wilson, uncredited), a rootin’-tootin’ American cowboy. Bizarrely, the movie gives their dispute a gay subtext. In a slip of the tongue, Octavius addresses Larry as Mary, and Jedediah, quoting from “Brokeback Mountain,” tells Octavius, “I can’t quit you.” I guess it means that nowadays such smidgens of “South Park” humor are thrown into family movies to make everybody feel terribly knowing. 
But when “Night at the Museum” returns to Larry’s personal life, it dies. The movie doesn’t even make a pretense of being interested in the scenes between Larry and Nick (Jake Cherry), the 10-year-old son whose respect he is losing. And its cynical lack of concern for giving the characters human feelings is a grave drawback for a movie that wants to engage children. 
“Night at the Museum” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.

‽We Are Marshall‽,‽“We Are Marshall” is the kind of crassly formulaic movie in which everything hinges on a single play in the final seconds of a big football game. Such manipulative, adrenaline-stimulating tricks are all too commonplace, and sometimes they work. Rarely, however, has one been drawn out as shamelessly and to such damaging effect as the moment of truth in “We Are Marshall.” 
Once the ball is tossed, it hovers in slow motion while the movie pauses to reprise itself in a flashback montage that seems to last forever (20 seconds can be a lifetime). Because the snippets bear no dramatic resonance, you have the queasy sensation of a movie devouring itself in one final, desperate act of cannibalism. 
That a climactic scene meant to be charged with unbearable suspense produces nothing but impatience is all the sadder because “We Are Marshall” tells a potentially inspiring true story. On Nov. 14, 1970, a chartered jet carrying the Marshall University football team from North Carolina back to its hometown, Huntington, W.Va., crashed in the Appalachian Mountains less than a minute before its scheduled landing; 37 players, 8 coaches and university staff members, the flight crew and 25 other Huntington citizens died. There were no survivors. 
In one of its only signs of restraint, “We Are Marshall” doesn’t show the final seconds before the crash. One minute we are inside the plane during a thunderstorm; the next, the movie stops for an instant, as though the power had gone out in the projection booth. Then it resumes. 
In the months after the crash, Huntington endured a collective trauma. The story of “We Are Marshall” is of a town regaining its spirit by putting together a new college team that goes back on the field less than a year later. Its savior is Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), a goofy outsider from the College of Wooster (in Ohio) who applies for the job of head coach after a long list of candidates turn it down and molds a motley assortment of new recruits into a functioning football team. 
Mr. McConaughey, in a change of pace from his pecs-flexing duties as a romantic dreamboat, sweats hard to bring some life into his zany, sartorially challenged character, whose hairstyle (long and slicked down, with sideburns) and wardrobe (hideous flowered shirts with oversize neck-to-shoulder collars) suggests a Mad Magazine parody of early-’70s fashion horrors. 
A movie like “We Are Marshall” stands or falls on its ability to make you feel the pain and loss of individuals in a place where community pride and football are one and the same. As the film, directed by McG (the “Charlie’s Angels” movies) from a wooden screenplay by Jamie Linden, follows a handful of Huntington residents during the months after the accident, not one of them comes fully to life. 
Crucial time that should be devoted to observing people is wasted studying game strategies. And the football sequences convey little  visceral sense of participation, either as a player or as a spectator.  Had the director studied “Friday Night Lights,” a football movie that gets right everything “We Are Marshall” gets wrong, it might have been otherwise. 
Mr. McConaughey, even in hyper-cornball mode, can’t generate dramatic (or even comic) friction between himself and the script’s stick figures. Those who show some signs of life are Red Dawson (Matthew Fox), the depressed assistant coach who missed the tragic flight and lacks the heart to go back onto the field, and the stiff university president, Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn), who neither knows nor cares about football. 
The player given the most screen time is Huntington’s other savior, Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie), a gung-ho varsity athlete who also missed the flight. Almost single-handedly he mobilizes the town to demand that football be continued after the president announces his plans to suspend the program for at least a year. But Nate still comes across as little more than a shrill, rah-rah mouthpiece. 
And “We Are Marshall” is nothing if not rah-rah. By the end of the movie, the three words of its title, which become the community’s rallying cry, have been shouted into your ears so insistently you will never want to hear them again. 
“We Are Marshall” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

‽Rocky Balboa‽,‽Aw, ya can’t help but love da big Palooka! Under all dem muscles the champ’s still got a heart o’ gold. 
Who else could that be but Rocky Balboa? Sylvester Stallone’s endearing alter ego with the droopy eyes and dungeon-master croak has slouched back onto the screen, bowed but unbroken, to fight the good fight one more time. Since he was last seen 16 years ago in “Rocky V,” this two-time former heavyweight champion, now pushing 60 (Mr. Stallone’s age), has evolved a philosophy of the ring that befits an older, slower athlete. 
The measure of a prizefighter is not how much punishment you can give but how much you can take, he declares more than once. In other words, heroism equals masochism; no gain without pain. Mel Gibson would understand. 
Mr. Stallone’s body is a sight. A weightlifter’s slab of aged meat, knotted with tiny hard veins popping out of the shoulders, it is just this side of muscle-bound and somewhat grotesque. It is something you might see hung in the window of a steak house and wonder what kind of carnivore would order such a leathery, sinewy carcass. 
When I first learned of this film, presumably the final episode in the “Rocky” franchise, the idea of the 60-year-old Rocky going at it one last time sounded risible. Reports of audiences snickering derisively at trailers for the movie seemed to confirm my expectations. 
Surprisingly “Rocky Balboa,” is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It’s all heart and no credibility except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. 
For what T. S. Eliot wrote about humans being unable to bear “too much reality” is doubly true for moviegoers. Most of us go to the movies to sit in the dark and dream the impossible dream, whether it’s fighting a heavyweight bout or playing love scenes with Brad and Angelina. 
Like “Rocky,” the Bicentennial fantasy that inaugurated the series, “Rocky Balboa” is a skeletal movie, a live-action cartoon that operates on cartoon logic. Don’t ask why this former heavyweight champion still lives in squalor in South Philadelphia while owning a popular restaurant named after his sainted wife, Adrian (now five years gone from cancer)? Don’t ask why his whiny son, Robert (Milo Ventimigilia), a charmless yuppie manqué with a chip on his shoulder, does not bear the slightest resemblance to his father. 
Be happy to relive the good old times and to appreciate the touchstones that are dutifully trotted out. Here comes Rocky’s combative brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), a character seen in every Rocky movie and looking much the worse for wear, to loiter disconsolately at the restaurant for no particular reason. And here comes Bill Conti’s familiar blaring theme music when the action finally picks up. 
Now more than ever Rocky Balboa seems a throwback to the era of the chaste noble athlete who is too pure for sex. He’d rather pray at the shrine of his dead wife than think of finding a new one. When the possibility of romance presents itself in the person of Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a barmaid and single mother, who in the original “Rocky” was a teenager who hurled abuse at him, he is oblivious. But she too is a throwback. Wide-eyed and pug-faced, tough but understanding, she is a true-blue sidekick for a Dead End Kid, and Rocky, in his infinite generosity, invites her to work in his restaurant. 
“Rocky Balboa” drags its feet for a dangerously long time before the main course sashays onto the screen. When a computer-simulated match between Rocky (in his fighting prime) and the current heavyweight champion Mason (The Line) Dixon (the light heavyweight Antonio Tarver), determines that Rocky would win, people get excited. Dixon, though undefeated, has earned so little respect after a series of easy victories that his management decides that an exhibition match in which Dixon holds back his full power would be good for his career. 
A grunting and heaving training montage follows, and finally the bout, a 10-round cliffhanger in Las Vegas with every bell and whistle activated, in which neither fighter holds back. And that’s it. Gonna fly now. 
“Rocky Balboa” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has violence, but it’s confined to the ring.

‽
‽Charlotte's Web‽,‽“It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both.” So ends “Charlotte’s Web,” by E. B. White, not only one of the most beloved children’s books, but as close to perfect as any book I can think of. The arrival of a new movie version — to update the junky-looking but serviceable cartoon musical from 1973, with a voice cast that included Debbie Reynolds and Paul Lynde — is cause for anxiety as well as eagerness. On the one hand, it’s hard to ruin such fine material. On the other hand, even the smallest misjudgment might feel like a desecration. And what combination of digital imagery and traditional camera work could match the eloquence of Garth Williams’s pen-and-ink illustrations? 
But these apprehensions are no reason to blame filmmakers for trying, or to withhold praise when they succeed. Gary Winick’s film, from a script credited to Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick, may not be perfect, but it honors its source and captures the key elements — the humor and good sense, as well as the sheer narrative exuberance — that have made White’s book a classic. 
The rural setting of the book, first published in 1952, suggests a homespun, small-town simplicity, which Mr. Winick evokes with shots of clapboard farmhouses and downtown brick storefronts. No era is specified, but the clothes, cars and kitchen appliances have a vintage look. This nostalgic tableau of county fairs and wood-sided pickup trucks is not, however, the only element in White’s fictional world. Much as he cherished the bucolic quiet of Brooklin, Me., he possessed a thoroughly modern, Manhattanite sensibility. He was a country mouse only by the standards of The New Yorker. 
And “Charlotte’s Web” is a sneakily sophisticated fable. White certainly appreciated the joys of life on the farm (while evading some of its bloodier aspects), but the book is really about the benevolent, even miraculous power of celebrity. It is, most simply, the story of a spider, Charlotte A. Cavitica, who saves the life of a pig named Wilbur by making him famous. She is a gifted writer whose chosen genre is what we might now call the pull quote  — her oeuvre consists of the words “terrific,” “radiant,” “some pig” and, in a stroke of public relations genius, “humble,” all emblazoned in webbing for the world to see. Charlotte is a self-effacing manufacturer of celebrity. An eight-legged flack. It’s not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good publicist. 
It is perhaps fitting, then, that in the movie, Wilbur (voiced by Dominic Scott Kay) should hang out in a V.I.P. barn, inhabited by the likes of John Cleese (as a sheep), Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer (as geese) and Robert Redford (as a horse). Charlotte’s lines are spoken by the biggest star of all, Julia Roberts, whose voice is as precise and melodious as a well-tuned piano. (She’s much better here than she was in “The Ant Bully,” by the way. I never really bought her as a social insect.) Ms. Roberts clearly understands that what makes Charlotte such an unforgettable character is not only her generosity, but also an intellectual rigor that stops just short of pedantry and a slightly starchy sense of her own dignity. In Wilbur’s eyes, she is the ideal grown-up: a mentor, teacher and protector whose love has no stickiness or strings attached. 
The physical form of the spider — and also of her foil, Templeton the rat (Steve Buscemi) — is rendered in realistic, unflashy computer animation, which blends seamlessly with the live-action people and animals. Dakota Fanning, on the verge of outgrowing such roles, is Fern, who rescues Wilbur, the runt of the litter, from her father’s ax. When the little pig grows too big to be a house pet, he moves to the farm run by Fern’s uncle (Gary Basaraba) and aunt (Siobhan Fallon), who provide some human comic relief. A pair of crows (Thomas Haden Church  and André Benjamin) are on hand for vaudevillian banter and a few chase scenes involving Templeton. 
Mr. Winick, who previously directed “Tadpole” and “13 Going on 30,” captures the various moods of White’s clear, sprightly prose: the wry, sometimes uproarious humor, the keenly observed characters, and the unapologetic and entirely appropriate moments of high sentiment. Like the book, the film is grounded in the rhythms of the natural world, observing the progress of the seasons and, in its understated and tremendously moving conclusion, illuminating the cycle of life, death and reproduction that governs any good story. The only serious flaw in “Charlotte’s Web” is that Danny Elfman’s musical score, which is perfectly adequate if not terribly imaginative, plays under the action loudly and virtually without interruption, robbing the picture of a sense of rustic tranquillity that would ground its antic flights. 
But otherwise the movie is a delight: never coarse, rarely preachy and less concerned with proving its own cleverness than with paying tribute to the wisdom of White’s book. I am tempted to plagiarize the immortal words of its heroine: “Charlotte’s Web” is humble, and also terrific. 
“Charlotte’s Web” is rated G.

‽The Pursuit of Happyness‽,‽A fairy tale in realist drag, “The Pursuit of Happyness” is the kind of entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your craw. Inspired by a true story, as they like to say in Hollywood, the film traces the fleeting ups and frightening downs of Chris Gardner, whose efforts to keep his family from sinking into poverty evolve into a life-and-death struggle of social Darwinian proportions. It’s the early 1980s, and while Ronald Reagan is delivering the bad economic news on television, Chris is about to prove you don’t need an army to fight the war on poverty, just big smiles and smarts, and really sturdy shoes. (It also helps that the star playing him is as innately sympathetic as Will Smith.) 
Given  how often Chris breaks into a run on the streets of San Francisco, it’s a good thing his shoes are well built; his lungs, too. Written by Steven Conrad and directed by Gabriele Muccino, “The Pursuit of Happyness” recounts how Chris, plagued by some bad luck, a few stupid moves and a shrew for a wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), loses his apartment and, with his 5-year-old, Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith’s own beautiful son), joins the ranks of the homeless, if not the hopeless. Evicted from the mainstream and bounced from shelter to shelter, Chris holds firm to his dignity, resolve, faith, love and independence. His optimism sweeps through the film like a searchlight, scattering clouds and dark thoughts to the wind. 
It’s the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold. To that calculated end, the filmmaking is seamless, unadorned, transparent, the better to serve Mr. Smith’s warm expressiveness. That warmth feels truthful, as does the walk-up apartment Chris’s family lives in at the start of the film, which looks like the real paycheck-to-paycheck deal. As does the day care center, which is so crummy it can’t even get happiness right (hence the title). 
This is no small thing, considering the film industry’s usual skewed sense of economic class, a perspective encapsulated by the insider who described the middle-class family in “Little Miss Sunshine” to me as working class, perhaps because the mother drives a gently distressed Miata rather than next year’s Mercedes. 
Money matters in “The Pursuit of Happyness,” as it does in life. But it matters more openly in this film than it does in most Hollywood stories that set their sights on the poor, largely because Chris’s pursuit of happiness eventually becomes interchangeable with his pursuit of money. He doesn’t want just a better, more secure life for himself and his child; either by scripted design or by the example of the real Chris Gardner, he seems to yearn for a life of luxury, stadium box seats and the kind of sports car he stops to admire in one scene. His desires aren’t just upwardly mobile; they’re materialistically unbound. Instead of a nice starter home, he (and the filmmakers) ogles mansions. It’s no wonder he hopes to become a stockbroker. 
That may sound like a punch line, at least to some ears, but it’s the holy grail in “The Pursuit of Happyness.” A self-starter, Chris has sunk all of the family’s money into costly medical scanners that he tries to sell to doctors and hospitals. But the machines are overpriced, and the sure thing he banked on has landed them in debt. Forced to work two shifts at a dead-end job, Linda angrily smolders and then rages at Chris, which seems reasonable since he has gambled all of their savings on an exceptionally foolish enterprise. (And, unlike her, he hasn’t signed up for overtime.) But this is a film about father love, not mother love, and Linda soon leaves the picture in a cloud of cigarette smoke and a storm of tears. 
Chris and the filmmakers seem happy to see her go, but life only gets tougher once she and her paychecks disappear. Much of the film involves Chris’s subsequent efforts to keep himself and his child housed and fed while he is enrolled in an unpaid internship program at a powerful stock brokerage firm. Bright and ferociously determined, Chris easily slides into this fantastical world of shouting men, ringing phones, gleaming surfaces and benevolent bosses. He goes along to get along, and when one of his bosses asks for money to pay for a cab, he quickly opens his wallet. Chris himself stiffs another working man for some money because that wallet is so light. But this is a film about him, not the other guy. 
How you respond to this man’s moving story may depend on whether you find Mr. Smith’s and his son’s performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. Both performances are certainly likable in the extreme, though Mr. Smith shined brighter and was given much more to do when he played the title character in Michael Mann’s underrated “Ali.” That film proves an interesting comparison with this one, not in filmmaking terms, but in its vision of what it means to be a black man struggling in America. In one, a black man fights his way to the top with his fists; in the other, he gets there with a smile. 
 “The Pursuit of Happyness” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild adult language and some parental fighting.

‽Eragon‽,‽“Eragon” is what happens when misguided studio executives option a novel written by a teenager (Christopher Paolini) with a head full of Anne McCaffrey and Ursula K. Le Guin. Not full enough, however; this boy-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen’s manager. Even the scaly star, a Delft-blue beastie whose tint suggests either royal lineage or hypothermia, seems unsure of her motivation. 
Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, “Eragon” boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Ed Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. A hint of the exotic is provided by a dreadlocked Djimon Hounsou — who seems to be phoning in his lines from a booth in the Bahamas — while the marvelous Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, playing a steadily decomposing wizard, hisses incantations from a mouth resembling a nicotine-stained graveyard. 
The film’s few moments of hilarity are no less welcome for being completely unintended (the young hero’s heavy-breathing romp with a strapping male cousin could only have been envisioned by someone completely lacking in subtext radar), though “Into the sky, to win or die!” doesn’t have quite the same mythic flair as “One Ring to Rule Them All.” And if some of the characters won’t be returning for the sequel, no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. 
“Eragon” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some medieval-style violence (impalings, bashing with heavy objects) and dragon-on-dragon mauling.

‽
‽Dreamgirls‽,‽The dramatic and musical peak of “Dreamgirls” — the showstopper, the main reason to see the movie — comes around midpoint, when Jennifer Hudson, playing Effie White, sings “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going.” That song has been this musical’s calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic. A former Disney cruise-ship entertainer with a physique to match her robust voice, Ms. Hudson was notoriously dismissed from “American Idol.” This sad instance of pop-cultural philistinism is echoed on the cover of the January 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, which omits her in favor of her better-known, thinner “Dreamgirls” co-stars Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx and Beyoncé Knowles. 
Of course such slights are consistent with the character Ms. Hudson plays in Bill Condon’s film version of the show, originally written by Henry Krieger (music) and Tom Eyen (book and lyrics). Effie is, at first, the lead singer in a Detroit vocal trio called the Dreamettes (later the Dreams), and also the lover of Curtis Taylor Jr. (Mr. Foxx), the car salesman turned musical entrepreneur who serves as the group’s manager. She is replaced, both onstage and in Curtis’s affections, by Deena Jones (Ms. Knowles), her skinnier, lighter-skinned and more pliable sidekick, and relegated to poverty and obscurity while the group ascends into the pop firmament (and also leaves the crumbling Motor City for Los Angeles). 
“And I Am Telling You,” for all the defiance of its lyric and the triumphal swell of its orchestration, is thus an anthem of impotence, a proud woman’s protest in the face of humiliation and defeat. Like it or not, Effie is going. She has no choice in the matter. But it’s not often you go to the movies and see a big-boned, sexually assertive, self-confident black woman — not played for laughs or impersonated by a male comedian in drag — holding the middle of the screen. And when was the last time you saw a first-time film actress upstage an Oscar winner, a pop diva and a movie star of long standing? Ms. Hudson is not going anywhere. She has arrived. 
The vehicle that delivers her, however, does not always run smoothly. “Dreamgirls” is a souped-up, collectors’-edition replica of a model that Detroit — I mean Hollywood — used to turn out with ease and regularity. At the moment,  and maybe only for a moment, stage musicals seem to be in reasonably good health, with solid revivals and lively new shows filling Broadway theaters. At the multiplexes, however, it’s a grimmer story. 
Periodic attempts to reinvigorate the form have a way of embalming it in nostalgia or tricking it out with frantic novelty. Or both. See “Moulin Rouge.” Audiences who go to “Dreamgirls” will have a good time, but they’ll be going for old time’s sake rather than to encounter anything vital or new. 
And if “Dreamgirls” is disappointing, it is not for lack of effort by Mr. Condon or his cast, who do their best to combine the big, showy gestures of stage performance with the finer-grained demands of naturalistic screen acting. Like Mr. Condon’s other films — “Gods and Monsters,” “Kinsey” and “Chicago” (which he wrote but did not direct) — “Dreamgirls” takes place at the intersection of fame and desire, where sexual longing gets mixed up with hunger for public recognition. 
No one in the movie expresses this tension better than Mr. Murphy, whose character, a soul singer named James (Thunder) Early, fights addiction, obsolescence and the demands of his own ego. Resorting frequently to the shorthand of montage, Mr. Condon for the most part succeeds in sustaining a narrative and emotional flow that links one song to the next. 
But the problem with “Dreamgirls” — and it is not a small one — lies in those songs, which are not just musically and lyrically pedestrian, but historically and idiomatically disastrous. This is a musical, after all, about music, about an especially vibrant and mutable strain of rhythm and blues that proclaimed itself, boastfully but not inaccurately, to be “the sound of young America.” 
Curtis is modeled — loosely enough to escape litigation — on Berry Gordy Jr., who turned Motown from a regional record label into a powerhouse. (The Dreams are a parallel-universe version of the Supremes.) The story of Curtis’s Rainbow Records is a familiar and potent tale of Faustian show-business ambition, as his climb to the top involves betraying and hurting the people closest to him. But without the right soundtrack, only half the story is being told. The performances are gratifyingly spirited, but what this movie most obviously lacks is soul. 
The great Motown songwriters — Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, the trio of geniuses known to posterity as Holland-Dozier-Holland — turned out great pop songs by the dozen, cutting bolts of blues, gospel and rock ’n’ roll into clean, trim, shiny garments. It is vain to imagine that Mr. Krieger and Mr. Eyen, who died in 1991, could replicate the Motown sound in all its variety, but as it is, the film barely acknowledges its existence. 
As the cushioned blasts of overorchestrated thunder assaulted my ears, I would have given anything for a crisp horn chart, a clean drum line, a chattering rhythm guitar or even a memorably witty or catchy verse. Periodically, a character — Curtis, James or Effie’s songwriter brother C. C. (Keith Robinson) — will announce the arrival of a “new sound.” But even though the chronology and the costumes march from doo-wop to disco, everything in “Dreamgirls” sounds more or less the same, as the splashy imperatives of show-tune composing overwhelm everything in their path. 
The music has the effect of compromising one of the crucial ambitions of the film: to refract the recent history of black America (and, by implication, America itself) through the prism of popular culture. Part of Curtis’s dream is to cross over and in the process permanently redefine the mainstream, and you hear a lot of talk about what kind of music will appeal to black or white ears. 
You also see archival images (the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; riots in Detroit) that register the aspirations and disappointments of America in the 1960s. But the music provides no guidance through the times, and as it tries to negotiate a period of profound change, it comes to rely on the talents of its production and costume designers, John Myhre and Sharen Davis, both of whom do brilliant work. The decades are marked by the progression of hairstyles, lapels, jewelry and dresses; after a while the experience starts to feel like a long, noisy guided tour through a museum. 
Except of course that the dioramas occasionally spring to life when the singers transcend the limitations of the songs. This happens, most memorably, twice: when Ms. Hudson lays claim to “And I Am Telling You,” and when Ms. Knowles, late in the movie, lets loose in a recording booth on “Listen,” one of a handful of new songs written for the film. 
Until that point her character, Deena, has been something of an enigma and, for Curtis, the passive vessel of his ambitions.   Ms. Knowles’s performance has been static and detached. In her limited work in movies she has never seemed comfortable with acting, shying away from any emotional display that might compromise her steely, hieratic dignity. But when she sings, she is capable of warmth, vulnerability, even ferocity, all of which she demonstrates in “Listen.” You cannot help but obey the imperative of the song’s title, even as you may wish the movie offered more that was worth listening to. 
“Dreamgirls” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some sexual content, profanity and drug use.

‽Unaccompanied Minors‽,‽“Unaccompanied Minors,” directed by Paul Feig and written by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark, presents a nightmarish, dystopian vision of contemporary America in which airline deregulation and the prevalence of divorce have turned our airports into grim holding pens for feral children and embittered workers. Not for the faint of heart, the movie is unsettling and startlingly true to life. 
At least that’s how it seemed to me. To the minors I happened to be accompanying, it seemed to be reasonably good fun. Far from horrifying or enraging them, the failure of just about every grown-up except Wilmer Valderrama to behave decently and responsibly filled them with delight, much as the pervasive adult cluelessness provided the movie’s main characters with opportunities for mischief and friendship. 
Set on Christmas Eve at a snowed-in Midwestern airport, “Unaccompanied Minors” assembles a squad of familiar adolescent movie types. There’s the nice guy, unfairly labeled a loser (Dyllan Christopher); the rich girl (Gina Mantegna); the angry delinquent girl (Quinn Shephard); the anti-social fat boy (Brett Kelly). In a remarkable feat of economy, the nerd, the black kid and the Jew are all rolled into the agile, jug-eared person of Tyler James Williams. Individually and then collectively, these children run afoul of Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), who is the airport’s director of passenger relations and the movie’s designated Scrooge. His underling, Zach (Mr. Valderrama), is torn between the demands of his boss and his compassion for the kids. 
Mr. Black’s fellow alumnus from “The Daily Show,”  Rob Corddry, plays an environmental-activist dad who tries to rescue his children in a biodiesel-powered Mercedes. The explosion of that vehicle is one of a few moments of loud, obvious comic action that seem to have been included to justify the status of “Unaccompanied Minors” as a theatrically released motion picture, rather than the kiddie-cable seasonal special it should have been. In any case, this movie may be too much for sensitive parents to bear. Send your kids alone. 
“Unaccompanied Minors” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some crude humor and a few very mild sexual innuendoes.

‽Ever Again‽,‽You may wonder why you’re not feeling more outrage as you watch “Ever Again,” a documentary that seeks to shine a spotlight on recent examples of anti-Semitism, primarily in Europe. Perhaps it’s the disjointed presentation, frustratingly short on context and complexity. Perhaps it’s Kevin Costner’s narration, which is somewhere between a low-grade whine and an aid-to-sleep tape. Perhaps it’s the natural human resistance to being lectured, no matter how noble the intent; the film is by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and displays its one-sidedness unabashedly. 
Certainly “Ever Again”  could have been  more powerful without much more effort.  It undercuts itself by being an indiscriminate grab bag. Legitimate discussion points — for instance, that some of today’s Jews invoke the suffering of the Holocaust to excuse whatever actions they care to take — are lumped in with the most preposterous of statements (“Muslims love everybody, but the Jewish hate Muslims,” one man asserts), as if they’re all self-evidently anti-Semitic. 
Just as irksomely, the film is afraid to explore its most compelling ideas. Early on, Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard legal scholar (who is heard from frequently in the film), suggests that even people who don’t much care about the Jews should be alarmed by rising anti-Semitism. “The Jews have always been the canary in the mine,” he says: the same extremism that takes aim at them eventually comes looking for other targets. Also interesting is the notion that anti-Semitism is no longer the exclusive province of the far right; it is also becoming fashionable on the left. But neither idea is fleshed out because  the film is too eager to get to the next outrageous clip of hate speech. 
Yet perhaps, dismayingly, bad filmmaking isn’t really to blame for the lack of punch in “Ever Again.” Perhaps it’s the familiarity of it all. A documentary using this same formula could be made by homosexuals, blacks, Muslims, immigrants and a hundred other aggrieved groups, and probably has been. In this film and in the world at large, the chorus of complaints seems a whole lot louder than the voices of tolerance and enlightenment.

‽The Holiday‽,‽The director Nancy Meyers gets a kick out of romantic love, but she also grooves to its agonies, particularly those of the more prolix kind. In her neo-screwball world of dizzy dames and the heartbreakers who do and done them wrong, love is a drug, an escape, an ordeal and a ready excuse for a lot of chatter. The men and women in a Nancy Meyers film don’t just fall in love; they talk about falling in love, about falling out of love, about needing, fearing and surrendering to love. They would, I imagine, have driven Raymond Carver crazy. 
Ms. Meyers can also drive her fans crazy, largely because her ravenous need to please the audience sometimes gets in the way of her talent. In the fizzy “Something’s Gotta Give,” a romantic comedy that holds up to repeat viewings, even on airplanes, where it nicely fills the small screen, this eagerness dovetails beautifully with Diane Keaton’s fidgety performance as a woman stunned by new love. (And with Jack Nicholson, no less.) The underlying anxiousness of the filmmaking, the almost obsessive reliance on patter and pratfalls, and even the neurotic tastefulness of the costumes and sets (every outfit is just right, every bibelot just so) find a perfect corollary in each of Ms. Keaton’s artful, becoming twitches and blushes. 
There are similar currents of unease in “The Holiday,” most generated by Iris, a lovesick English rose played by Kate Winslet, and by the wobbliness of the narrative framework. Employed by The Daily Telegraph in London, where she has improbably scored an office for writing the wedding column, Iris is in love with Jasper (Rufus Sewell). She has also committed to an unfortunate type of romantic masochism because while he’s the flame, these days she’s only the keeper. 
Though he now makes time with a twiggy brunette (as Iris cries into her computer), the exes nonetheless come across as cozy as old slippers. It’s not clear if the relationship was ever consummated, but it has puttered along for years, fired by her desire and fanned by his need for her adoration. 
Ms. Winslet is always a welcome screen presence, and if this were the story of how Iris eventually chucked Jasper aside for someone worthier, say, like Hugh Grant in “Love Actually” or the dodgier (if sexier) Hugh Grant of the Bridget Jones comedies, it might be easier to fall for “The Holiday.” But Ms. Meyers, whose ambitions are telegraphed by her film’s title, which directly invokes George Cukor’s lovely 1938 romp “Holiday,” has created a cumbersome vehicle by saddling Iris with a flamboyantly glamorous Los Angeles double, Amanda. As played by Cameron Diaz with oodles of charm and not an ounce of persuasion, Amanda doesn’t as much mirror Iris’s love troubles as throw them into wincing relief. 
On the brink of Christmas, these two strangers trade homes for the holidays and land smack in each other’s lifestyles. Amanda ends up in a sweet country cottage that looks as if it has been drawn by Beatrix Potter, while Iris moves into a Los Angeles mansion with a maid and a pool large enough for the Olympics. There is a huge Robert Longo  hanging over the staircase and a flat-screen TV on which Iris delights in Hollywood treasures with Barbara Stanwyck that Ms. Meyers fires up like beacons. In case Iris or anyone else misses the point, there is also a sweet-and-sour old-studio screenwriter (a sly Eli Wallach) who waxes indignant about what has happened to the movies while his dusty Oscar stands watch. 
“The Holiday” is a tale of two women, two houses, two love interests — Jude Law pairs with Ms. Diaz, Jack Black gets lucky with Ms. Winslet — but it’s also about movie love. There is something touching if willfully naïve about Ms. Meyers’s nostalgia for Hollywood’s golden age, when Louis B. Mayer ruled the very lot on which she shot part of this film. If her name had been Ned, not Nancy, she might have thrived then. She wouldn’t have been allowed to go amusingly (or maddeningly) off point, but her commercial instincts would have been encouraged, her indulgences — like filling mouths with speeches, not dialogue — squelched. An old-studio producer would have recognized that there are several films jammed into this one and maybe called in Ben Hecht for a polish, even as he recognized that Ms. Meyers always has something to give. 
“The Holiday” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some adult language and suggestions of lovemaking.

‽
‽Blood Diamond‽,‽The makers of “Blood Diamond,” an exceptionally foolish thriller starring a most excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger.  The story involves so-called conflict diamonds, illicitly mined stones that have been used to finance some of the most vicious wars in Africa. If films were judged solely by their good intentions, this one would be best in show. Instead, gilded in money and dripping with sanctimony, confused and mindlessly contradictory, the film is a textbook example of how easily commercialism can trump do-goodism, particularly in Hollywood. 
Mr. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a Rhodesian-born diamond smuggler  who, having been orphaned during his native country’s violent struggles in the 1970s, has spent most of his 30-some years crisscrossing the continent as a soldier of fortune and a merchant of misery. Tousled and tanned, with a long, slicing gait and a killer smile, Danny looks as if he were born for trouble of the sweetest kind. But Mr. DiCaprio, perhaps because he knows that much of the audience has already crawled into his pocket, plays the smuggler as the scum he is.  Even as the film coaxes Danny toward redemption, the actor fights to hold his ground and the truth of a character who has inspired the most fully sustained performance of his adult life. 
This being an Edward Zwick film, it’s no surprise that redemption is on the menu. Mr. Zwick likes to make epic-size movies about men of anguish and conscience who, whether they wear Civil War blue (“Glory”) or a Meiji kimono (“The Last Samurai”), invariably land on the side of the angels. Danny is initially on the side of the devils, and when we first meet him in 1999 he is trying to cross the border of  a perilously unstable Sierra Leone with a stash of diamonds tucked into some goats.  Busted by a patrol from Sierra Leone, he lands in jail, where he soon hears of a precious pink diamond  unearthed by a fisherman turned unwilling miner, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou). 
The chase is on, and on. Written by Charles Leavitt, “Blood Diamond” more or less plays like an exotically situated action flick as each man races toward his respective goal. Solomon hopes to reunite with his wife and three children, from whom he has been violently separated; Danny just wants a score big enough to pay his way permanently out of Africa. Theirs might be a match made in movie-genre heaven if the filmmakers didn’t insist  on wagging their fingers in our faces and delivering dire statistics by the ream, the intimations of Antwerp intrigue and an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), whose preferred interview method involves shimmying up to her subject like a pole dancer. 
If the sociopolitical context weren’t so appalling,  this ludicrous characterization and Ms. Connelly’s equally woeful performance would be easy to laugh off. But both are insulting because they transpire against a backdrop of human suffering, suffering that Maddy sternly lectures Danny for exploiting even as she snaps another photograph of the very same. (Say what!?) Any question that the filmmakers might be clued into Maddy’s cluelessness, might be directly engaging the contradictions involved whenever misery becomes fodder for entertainment, is answered by the documentarylike images of children roaming a mound of garbage, by the blank-looking men and women sitting in trash-strewn streets and by the periodically brandished arm and leg stumps. The horror, the horror. 
Like “The Constant Gardener,” this film betrays an almost quasi-touristic fascination with images of black Africans, who function principally as colorful scenery or, as in the gruesome scenes inside rebel training camps, manifestations of pure evil. Pure evil that, incidentally, likes to listen to rap and, in one case, wears a Snoop Dogg T-shirt along with his gat. Good as gold, Solomon earns a sizable share of screen time, and though the performance is expectedly sympathetic, the character has none of Danny’s complexity, which means that he’s inherently less interesting. Mr. Hounsou, who first came to attention as a noble African in “Amistad” and has often had to play the same role since, must be awfully tired of holding his head up so high. 
“Blood Diamond” means well, but it also means box-office business. Hollywood has always traveled to faraway places (or at least tricked out sound stages) to spin yarns about moral calamity perfumed with the exotic. Whether down Mexico way or in Morocco, it generally kept the atmospheric extras — the snake-hipped dancing girl, the scoundrel in the burnoose, the smiler in the fez — stashed in the background, where they wouldn’t distract from the star attractions. “Blood Diamond” wants to bring those blurred figures closer into view, notably through Solomon. But the rushing camerawork, breakneck editing, compulsion to go, go, go onto the next genre beat mean that there is next to no time for such niceties. The faces remain obscured, the voices muted, even as Danny comes sharply into focus. 
The tragedy of Sierra Leone and the complicity of Americans, who buy more diamonds than any other consumers in the world, deserve louder, more clamorous attention than the occasional news report.  And certainly big-budget Hollywood action films are plenty loud and plenty clamorous, and the volume is only    turned up to shrieking with the addition of the international heartthrob who, by sacrificing himself on the altar of love in “Titanic,” conquered a generation of young female fans (the same demographic most likely to brandish a rock on its ring finger). 
Yet while Mr. DiCaprio turns out to be an ideal fit for “Blood Diamond,” there’s an insolvable disconnect between this serious story and the frivolous way it has been told. There is no reason to doubt the filmmakers’ sincerity; only their filmmaking. 
“Blood Diamond” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film includes scenes of extreme violence, some of which involve child soldiers.

‽
‽Off the Black‽,‽In “Off the Black” Nick Nolte dives beneath the blubber to bare the weary soul of Ray Cook, an automobile junkyard operator pushing 60 who also umpires high-school baseball games. A heaving wreck of a man, Ray lives alone in a seedy cottage near a railroad track and drinks himself into a stupor each night in front of the television. 
Although he leaves Post-it messages in the refrigerator reminding himself to keep to a three-beer limit, he is incapable of following his own rules. In more sober moments he videotapes himself recounting the day’s activities for a diary. As he leaves a medical examination, his doctor throws up his hands in frustration; he wouldn’t know where to begin operating. We get the message: Ray’s days are numbered. 
“Off the Black,” the feature-film debut of the director James Ponsoldt, tells the formulaic story of Ray’s last hurrah, in which he blackmails a teenager into posing as his son and accompanying him to his 40th high-school reunion. As he and the pretender, Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), go through the ritual, Mr. Nolte’s craggy face and phlegmy growl register every seismic rumble of Ray’s troubled psyche. And he and Mr. Morgan (likeably fresh but far from dewy-eyed) sustain a convincing rapport. 
This modest film could easily have skidded into the mawkish marshland where countless mentor-protégé, father-son dramas have suffocated. But for the most part it steers away from the worst clichés of that tear-drenched genre. 
Ray and Dave first cross paths in a male version of meeting cute. Umpiring a ballgame in which Dave is pitching, Ray makes a critical call that walks a batter who scores the winning run. (The title “Off the Black” refers to a pitch that just misses the strike zone.) In revenge Dave and two teammates vandalize Ray’s property, strewing the trees with toilet paper, scrawling graffiti on the pavement outside the house and breaking one of his car windows. 
As they flee, Ray wakes from his haze, grabs a gun and rushes outside, where he catches Dave and drags him into the house. Once they calm down, the frightened boy agrees to clean up the mess if Ray doesn’t call the police. 
As Dave undoes the damage, the two become acquainted, and Ray develops enough of a liking for the vandal to take him fishing on the local river (the movie was filmed in upstate New York) and to offer him fishy advice. (“If you haven’t fished, you don’t know anything about women.”) 
The movie follows Dave into his own troubled home where his father, a professional photographer (Timothy Hutton in an underwritten role), has been depressed since his wife left two years earlier. Frustratingly, the movie offers no explanation of why she left. 
Dave’s family history is only one of several plot strands that seem as if they might have been edited out of the movie. Dave also has an uneasy relationship with his younger sister (but why?) and develops a flirtatious friendship with a single mother (Rosemarie DeWitt) who is a friend of Ray’s (but how good a friend and from where?). As a rehearsal for the reunion, Ray drags Dave to a hospital to visit Ray’s father (Michael Higgins), who has Alzheimer’s, and play the old man’s grandson; Dave passes the test. 
“Off the Black” is so much Mr. Nolte’s movie that it couldn’t exist without him. His character is the latest in a long line of Hemingway-esque ruins, marinated in beer and testosterone, who have become Mr. Nolte’s specialty. 
As fond as he is of these guys, Mr. Nolte has the wisdom and acting smarts not to sentimentalize them. In these roles you often have the sense of this wonderful actor casting a pitiless, smirking gaze into the mirror as he contemplates his own decaying magnificence. 
 “Off the Black” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some profanity.

‽
‽Apocalypto‽,‽“I’m going to peel off his skin and make him watch me wear it.” This grisly threat is delivered by one of the main bad guys in Mel Gibson’s  “Apocalypto.” The promised flaying never takes place, but viewers who share this director’s apparently limitless appetite for gore will not be disappointed, since not much else in the way of bodily torment has been left to the imagination. There are plenty of disembowelings, impalings, clubbings and beheadings. Hearts are torn, still beating, from slashed-open chests. A man’s face is chewed off by a jaguar. Another’s neck is pierced by darts tipped with frog venom. Most disturbing, perhaps, is the sight of hundreds of corpses haphazardly layered in an open pit: a provocative and ill-advised excursion into Holocaust imagery on this director’s part. 
Violence has become the central axiom in Mr. Gibson’s practice as a filmmaker,  his major theme and also his chief aesthetic interest. The brutality in “Apocalypto” is so relentless and extreme that it sometimes moves beyond horror into a kind of grotesque comedy, but to dismiss it as excessive or gratuitous would be to underestimate Mr. Gibson’s seriousness. And say what you will about him — about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews — he is a serious filmmaker. 
Which is not to say that “Apocalypto” is a great film, or even that it can be taken quite as seriously as it wants to be. Mr. Gibson’s technical command has never been surer; for most of its 2-hour 18-minute running time, “Apocalypto,” written by Mr. Gibson and Farhad Safinia, is a model of narrative economy, moving nimbly forward and telling its tale with clarity and force. It is, above all, a muscular and kinetic action movie, a drama of rescue and revenge with very little organic relation to its historical setting. Yes, the dialogue is in various Mayan dialects, which will sound at least as strange to American ears as the Latin and Aramaic of “The Passion of the Christ,” but the film’s real language is Hollywood’s, and Mr. Gibson’s, native tongue. 
When I first heard about this project, and later when I saw the early trailers, I halfway hoped that Mr. Gibson might turn out to be an American (or half-Australian) version of Werner Herzog, setting out into the jungle to explore the dark and tangled regions of human nature. Once you get past the costumes and the subtitles, though, the most striking thing about “Apocalypto” is how comfortably it sits within the conventions of mainstream moviemaking. It is not an obsessive opera like Mr. Herzog’s “Aguirre: The Wrath of God,” but rather a pop period epic in the manner of “Gladiator” or “Braveheart,” and as such less interested in historical or cultural authenticity than in imposing an accessible scheme on a faraway time and place. 
The setting is Central America before the arrival of the Spanish, when the Maya empire, in Mr. Gibson’s version, was already in the process of collapsing from within. The basic moral conflict — as it was in “Braveheart,” directed by and starring Mr. Gibson, and in “The Patriot,” a vehicle for him directed by Roland Emmerich — is between a small group of people trying to live simple, decent, traditional lives and a larger, more powerful political entity driven by bloodlust and greed. This kind of conservative anti-imperialism runs consistently through Mr. Gibson’s work;  whether the empire in question is Roman, British or Mesoamerican, and whatever its political resonance might be, it allows the viewer to root for an unambiguously virtuous underdog. 
“Apocalypto” begins with a group of young men out on a hunt and lingers for a while in their happy, earthy village, a place that might double as a nostalgic vision of small-town America were it not for the loin cloths, the tattooed buttocks and the facial piercings. Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) is nagged by his mother-in-law and teased by his buddies because he hasn’t yet made his wife pregnant, but he accepts his humiliation in good humor, like the jolly fat kid on a family sitcom. 
Meanwhile Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose father (Morris Birdyellowhead) is an admired hunter and warrior, snuggles down with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their young son, Turtle Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). There’s fresh tapir meat on the grill and an old-timer telling stories by the fire. Life is good. 
Needless to say, this pastoral idyll cannot last. The ominous strains of James Horner’s score indicate as much. Before long the village is set upon by fearsome marauders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), who rape, burn and kill with ruthless discipline and undisguised glee. The locals resist valiantly, but the survivors are led away to an uncertain fate. Seven and Turtle Run stay behind, hidden in a hole in the ground. 
Jaguar Paw’s mission will be to rescue them and also to avenge his friends and kin. First, though, he will accompany us on a Cecil B. DeMille tour of the decadent imperial capital, a place of misery, luxury and corruption, where priests and nobles try to keep famine and pestilence at bay with round-the-clock human sacrifices. 
Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of “Apocalypto” is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director’s skill. 
Perhaps because he is aiming for an audience wary of subtitles, Mr. Gibson rarely uses dialogue as a means of exposition, and he proves himself to be an able, if not always terribly original, visual storyteller. He is not afraid of clichés — the slow-motion, head-on sprint toward the camera; the leap from the waterfall into the river below — but he executes them with a showman’s maniacal relish. 
And it is, all in all, a pretty good show. There is a tendency, at least among journalists, to take Mr. Gibson as either a monster or a genius, a false choice that he frequently seems intent on encouraging. Is he a madman or a visionary? Should he be shunned or embraced? Censured or forgiven? 
These are the wrong questions, but their persistence reveals the truth about this shrewd and bloody-minded filmmaker. He is an entertainer. He will be publicized, and he will be paid. 
“Apocalypto” is rated R (Under 17 must be accompanied by parent or adult guardian). See the first paragraph above.

‽
‽Quantum Hoops‽,‽Well now, if this isn’t just the cutest thing I don’t know what is. “Quantum Hoops,” a documentary by Rick Greenwald, tells the story of the California Institute of Technology’s men’s basketball team — a topic that in the context of college sports is approximately as farcical as the history of aspiring semioticians among the contestants on “America’s Next Top Model.” 
Established in 1919, the Caltech Beavers (so named after “nature’s engineer”) cull players from one of the most rigorously selective, academically demanding universities in the world. These boys are quite literally rocket scientists —  or, more accurately, double majors in rocket science and applied math. 
David Duchovny, who narrates this wry, good-natured picture with affable bemusement, informs us that Caltech lays claim to both the highest ratio of Nobel Prize winners to faculty and a men’s basketball team that at the time of filming was distinguished by a record 243 consecutive conference losses dating to 1985. Mr. Greenwald follows the Beavers’ try at breaking that losing streak during the final week of the 2006 season, while chronicling the handful of ups and many, many downs in the history of a team remembered less for its athletic prowess (or even competence) than for once including the father of modern computational fluid dynamics. 
QUANTUM HOOPS 
The Caltech Basketball Story 
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.  
Written, directed, produced and edited by Rick Greenwald; director of photography, Lauren Langford,; music by Brian Arbuckle; released by Green Forest Films. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes. This film is not rated. 
‽
‽Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem‽,‽The second “Aliens vs. Predator” film is, like its predecessor, one very dark movie. Not psychologically dark; dark  dark, as in, not very generously lighted. 
The first film took place largely underground, in Antarctica. The new one, which opened Tuesday, first finds itself in the sewers of a Colorado town, where the title, um, characters are doing battle. And then, after the intergalactic struggle moves to the local power plant, the electricity for the whole region is knocked out. Bring your night-vision goggles to this one. 
You might wonder if the shadowiness is a subtle admission of shame: “We don’t want anyone looking too closely at this thing.” But “Requiem,” as the new film is subtitled, has nothing to be ashamed of. It may not be classic sci-fi like the original “Alien,” which it has in its DNA, but it’s a perfectly respectable next step in the series. 
Reiko Aylesworth from “24” and Steven Pasquale from “Rescue Me” provide some acting cred as two residents of a small town in which a spaceship crash-lands. The film doesn’t seem interested in drawing any new fans to the series, because it doesn’t bother to provide any back story, but here’s the gist of it: The predators from the “Predator” films hunt the aliens of the “Alien” films, using Earth as a sort of practice range because the aliens breed inside humans. 
The first film ended with a new wrinkle: An alien bred inside a dead predator. As “Requiem” opens, the hybrid hatches aboard a predator space ship, all heck breaks loose, and the crash-landing is the result. 
Another predator is dispatched to Earth to track down the aliens, which have escaped from the crashed ship and are busily suction-cupping onto the faces of every Coloradoan in sight. 
Greg and Colin Strause, the directors, and Shane Salerno, the screenwriter, give the humans in the story much more attention than they received in the first film, which makes for a far more watchable movie. The story is fairly generic try-to-get-away stuff, but it’s decently rendered. There are a couple of classic horror-film bits in among the sci-fi — oh, you young people, don’t you know that skinny dipping attracts malevolent creatures? — and even one pretty funny joke. 
There is also a nice life-or-death choice for the survivors: go await a promised airlift, or go with the resourceful Ms. Aylesworth to look for a helicopter? Robert Joy is a perfect low-key villain in military guise. 
“Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem” is rated R (Under 17  requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence, gore and salty language.

‽The Water Horse‽,‽Many lonely children yearn for a pet to call their own. In “The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep,” based on a novel by Dick King-Smith, a  boy, Angus (Alex Etel), finds not only that, but a best friend as well, after the mysterious egg he stumbles across hatches a creature unlike any he’s ever seen. Adorable and full of mischief, his new companion, Crusoe, who looks something like a cross between a dinosaur and a snail, immediately adds spice to his drab life. 
Set in 1942 in coastal Scotland, the film consistently evokes an authentic sense of time and place and features remarkable computer-generated graphics work from Weta Workshop, the company responsible for the groundbreaking visuals of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. 
When Crusoe grows into the magnificent Loch Ness Monster and must be released to sea, its survival skills are put to the test, and the aggressive pursuit of the creature by townspeople and visiting soldiers alike stirs up “King Kong”-esque feelings of dread. 
Brian Cox appears briefly, serving as the film’s present-day narrator. His character’s identity offers no surprise — nor does much else in the film — but that detracts little from this family-friendly escapist fare that should enthrall, without insult, fantasy-minded viewers of any age. 
“The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has mild violence.

‽The Great Debaters‽,‽Its steadfast humanity, its literacy, its passionate belief in education, its faith that history teaches invaluable lessons and its strong, emotionally grounded performances: There are enough things to admire about “The Great Debaters,” the heavily fictionalized true story of The Little Debate Team That Could, that your impulse is to forgive the movie its shortcomings. 
The second film directed by Denzel Washington, “The Great Debaters” may not aspire to be more than inspirational pop entertainment in the Oprah Winfrey mode (Ms. Winfrey is one of its producers), but unlike so many films of its ilk,  it doesn’t insult your intelligence. And it reminds you that social history airbrushed for the screen by Hollywood is preferable to none at all. Despite its cosmetic embellishments, “The Great Debaters” obviously emanates from the heart. It makes you nostalgic for prototypes like Stanley Kramer’s socially conscious message movies of the 1950s and ’60s and for the era that produced them. 
As an enduring American myth, the triumph of the sanctified underdog, an intrepid spirit who doesn’t compromise his integrity on the slippery path to victory, may be much the worse for wear in these Darwinian times, but it can still produce a lump in your throat. The real tale  of the unlikely ascendance  of the debate team at Wiley College, a small all-black institution in Marshall, Tex., in 1935, follows the template of countless sports movies. Perseverance and teamwork lead to untarnished glory. 
In its tone, though not in its content, “The Great Debaters” is the sequel to Mr. Washington’s 2002 directorial debut, “Antwone Fisher,” in which he played a Navy psychiatrist whose tough love helps save a broken soul. Here he portrays the noted poet, social activist and educator Melvin B. Tolson, who coached the Wiley College team. Righteous, autocratic and fearless, Mr. Washington’s Tolson is a screen descendant of the stern East London schoolteacher played by Sidney Poitier 40 years ago in “To Sir, With Love.” If Mr. Washington’s two films are considerably richer in content than that civil rights-era weepie, at heart they are no less sentimental. 
Tolson is not only a ferocious coach but also a political firebrand (there are mutterings about his being a Communist) who runs afoul of the local sheriff (John Heard) for his organizing of the mixed-race Southern Tenant Farmers  Union. But whether Tolson is teaching or organizing, Mr. Washington imbues him with the authority of a persuasive orator and a moral Rock of Gibraltar. 
“The Great Debaters” is aware that debating, an activity synonymous with nerdiness, needs a shot of adrenaline to be sexy to a mass audience. Early in the movie Tolson barks with the ferocity of a Marine Corps drill instructor, “Debate is a blood sport.” As the team starts winning, his severity never diminishes. The debates themselves are swiftly edited compendiums of best-of moments. 
The four teammates handpicked by Tolson are Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), a handsome,  clean-cut youth with a lurking bad-boy streak; Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), a dutiful eager beaver whose family pressures him to drop out when Tolson’s radical political organizing comes to light; Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), a strait-laced aspiring lawyer and soft-edged proto-feminist; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a preacher’s son whose father (Forest Whitaker) keeps him on a tight leash. 
Despite his name, the actor playing James Jr. is unrelated to either Mr. Washington or to Forest Whitaker. It is worth noting that the senior Farmer was the first African-American in Texas to earn a doctorate. His son, a leader of the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s, founded the Congress of Racial Equality. 
This being Hollywood, a soupçon of romance is required. The movie dawdles only as long as necessary on the pudgy, cow-eyed young James’s hopeless infatuation with Samantha, who becomes romantically involved with Henry. 
“The Great Debaters” doesn’t shy away from showing the humiliation and persecution of blacks in the Jim Crow South. When James Farmer Sr., accompanied by his family, accidentally runs over a pig, his humiliation at the hands of the owner and his redneck buddies makes your stomach turn. 
Later, Tolson, driving home from a debate with his students, comes upon a lynching. The flashes of the hideous atrocity sear your mind, and when the mob, still riled with blood lust, chases the car, your heart is in your throat. Afterward, Henry’s shame and stifled fury drive him to a self-destructive spree. 
Robert Eisele’s screenplay imagines a smooth historical arc. The characters’ reactions to these events, it implies, sow the seeds of the civil-rights movement, which is also foreshadowed in the debates, whose topics too conveniently address civil-rights issues. Strangely, the Wiley College team always argues the progressive view. Its initial push to break the color barrier in college debating by competing with a white college in Oklahoma is too neatly paralleled by the debate topic: whether blacks should be allowed to attend state universities. A more intellectually subtle, less manipulative movie would have had the Wiley team arguing at least once against African-American interests. 
Even though the film makes it clear that the team’s speeches are prepared in advance by Tolson, the literary and historical references blithely tossed around by the team members show astounding erudition, and their speaking voices carry only the tiniest hint of an East Texas twang. 
For dramatic purposes the setting of the climactic debate has been changed in the movie to Harvard from the University of Southern California, where it actually took place. Again the issue is too neatly selected: nonviolent civil disobedience versus the rule of law. 
The wonder is that “The Great Debaters” transcends its own simplifying  and manipulative ploys; it radiates nobility of spirit. 
“The Great Debaters”  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and some strong language.

‽
‽Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street‽,‽Tim Burton makes fantasy movies. Stephen Sondheim writes musicals. It is hard to think of two more  optimistic genres of popular art, or of two popular artists who have so systematically subverted that optimism. Mr. Sondheim has always gravitated toward the dissonance lurking in hummable tunes, and has threaded his song-and-dance spectaculars with subtexts of anxiety and alienation. Mr. Burton, for his part, dwells most naturally (if somewhat uneasily) in the realms of the gothic and the grotesque, turning comic books and children’s tales into scary, nightmarish shadow plays. 
And so it should not be surprising that “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” Mr. Burton’s film adaptation of Mr. Sondheim’s musical, is as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the “Saw” franchise. Indeed, “Sweeney” is as much a horror film as a musical: It is cruel in its effects and radical in its misanthropy, expressing a breathtakingly, rigorously pessimistic view of human nature. It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme — I am tempted to say evil — genius. 
As it was originally performed onstage, with all the songs Mr. Sondheim composed for it, “Sweeney Todd” balanced its inherent grisliness with a whimsical vitality. The basic story is a revenger’s tragedy more Jacobean than Victorian, but Mr. Sondheim nonetheless wrings some grim, boisterous comedy out of both the impulse for vengeance and the bustling spirit of commerce. A barber, wronged by a powerful judge, returns to London and sets up shop, cutting throats as well as hair. The bodies of his victims are turned into savory meat pies by Mrs. Lovett, his energetic partner in business and crime. Cannibalism and mass murder as the basis for a hit show — what a perverse and delicious joke. 
It seemed a lot less funny in the recent revival, which starred Michael Cerveris and Patti Lupone in roles originated on Broadway by Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in 1979. Mr. Burton’s film, in spite of the participation of Sacha Baron Cohen (as a mountebank barber in a skin-tight costume) and Timothy Spall (as a louche bailiff) pretty much casts out frivolity altogether. Mr. Burton’s London is a dark, smoky oil slick of a city. Dante Ferretti’s production design, which owes something to the Victorian city confected for Carol Reed’s “Oliver!,” can make even daylight look sinister. Innocence, represented by a pair of young would-be lovers (Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower) has virtually no chance in this place; it is a joke played by fate, something to be corrupted, imprisoned or destroyed. 
Mrs. Lovett the pie maker is played by Helena Bonham Carter, a witchy fixture of Mr. Burton’s cinematic universe as well as the mother of his children. If the director has an alter ego, or at least an actor consistently able to embody his ideas on screen, it would have to be Johnny Depp. He was the hurt, misunderstood man-child in “Edward Scissorhands,” the cracked visionary in “Ed Wood” and the cold, creepy candy mogul in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” in each case giving  form to an emotional equation that had never quite been seen on film before. As Sweeney, his hair streaked with white and his eyes rimmed in black, he is an avatar of rage. 
Mr. Depp’s singing voice is harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful. He brings the unpolished urgency of rock ’n’ roll to an idiom accustomed to more refinement, and in doing so awakens the violence of Mr. Sondheim’s lyrics and melodies. Some of the crowd-pleasing numbers, like “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,” have been pared away, but their absence only contributes to the diabolical coherence of the film, which moves with a furious momentum toward its sanguinary conclusion. 
Like nearly every other horror-film serial killer — the outcast teenager abused by the cool kids; the decent man whose suffering has been  ignored or mocked — Sweeney starts out as a sympathetic figure. Once upon a time, he was a happy husband and father, until his lovely wife (Laura Michelle Kelly) caught the eye of a malignant judge (Alan Rickman), who transported the poor barber to Australia. Now, after many years, he has returned to find that his daughter, now a teenager, has become the judge’s ward. Finding his old straight razors — “my friends” — under the floorboards of his former shop, Sweeney sets out to ensnare the judge, a project that requires the deaths of quite a few customers along the way. 
“They’ll never be missed,” sings the practical Mrs. Lovett. Sweeney’s view is harsher, almost genocidal. “They all deserve to die,” he says, looking out over the rooftops of the city. And Mr. Burton depicts those deaths ruthlessly. The initial geyser of blood may seem artificially bright, but when the bodies slide head first from the chair down a chute into the cellar, they crash and crumple with sickening literalness. You are watching human beings turned into meat. 
It may seem strange that I am praising a work of such unremitting savagery. I confess that I’m a little startled myself, but it’s been a long time since a movie gave me nightmares. And the unsettling power of “Sweeney Todd” comes above all from its bracing refusal of any sentimental consolation, from Mr. Burton’s willingness to push the most dreadful implications of the story to their blackest conclusions. 
“Sweeney Todd” is a fable about a world from which the possibility of justice has vanished, replaced on one hand by vain and arbitrary power, on the other by a righteous fury that quickly spirals into madness. There may be a suggestion of hopefulness near the end, but you don’t see hope on the screen. What you see is as dark as the grave. What you hear — some of the finest stage music of the past 40 years — is equally infernal, except that you might just as well call it heavenly. 
“Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It’s not “Hairspray.”

‽
‽Charlie Wilson's War‽,‽Most of the recent films we’ve seen about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us what a drag those conflicts are, which may be why so few of us have bothered to go see them. Of course all wars are terrible, but good movies have a way of mitigating that dreary fact even as they acknowledge it. Take the cold war: a “long twilight struggle” (as John F. Kennedy put it) that brought the world to the brink of annihilation and provided a persistent source of tension, anxiety and dread for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Horrible, to be sure. But also kind of a blast. 
That, at any rate, is pretty much the gist of “Charlie Wilson’s War,” which may be more of a hoot than any picture dealing with the bloody, protracted fight between the Soviet Army and the Afghan  mujahedeen has any right to be. As the film observes, that fight, in which the United States semi-secretly armed Muslim anti-imperialist  freedom fighters for much of the 1980s, was a prequel to later trouble with anti-Western Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and elsewhere. 
But let’s not get ahead of the story. Before the blowback, after all, a mighty blow for freedom was struck by a congressman with an alleged fondness for snorting blow. And let’s not be too quick to dismiss the wisdom of his sidekick, a C.I.A. operative with a bad temper and a worse haircut: “If you’re gonna do this, you might as well have fun with it.” 
Fun is this movie’s unlikely and persuasive motto. If it’s the best politically themed movie to come around in a while, that may be because the director, Mike Nichols, and the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, grasp that politics, for all its seriousness, is an essentially comic undertak- ing. Their film is never glib or flippant, but instead shows a lightness of touch and a swiftness of attack — 96 minutes to drink some cocktails, make some deals and send the Russians packing —  that stand in welcome contrast to the plodding, somber earnestness of some recent movies I will tactfully refrain from naming. 
Not that discretion is necessarily the better part of valor. And it’s hard to imagine a hero as indiscreet as Charlie Wilson, a Democrat who represented Texas’s Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. Mr. Wilson, who retired from the House in 1996, is played with sly, rascally charisma by Tom Hanks. It is always a pleasure to see Mr. Hanks play against clean-cut type, and here he has the devilish smile of a middle-aged playboy who has woken up in a long-lost guilt-free sequel to “Bachelor Party.” 
An unapologetic womanizer —  the type whose lechery seems like a higher form of gallantry — Wilson staffs his office with long-stemmed babes and casually seduces a pious constituent’s daughter (Emily Blunt). He’s a sharp political operator all the same, and also a man of conscience, as his patient, all-seeing assistant (Amy Adams) is pleased to discover. 
When we first encounter Wilson, he’s very much in his element: soaking in a Las Vegas hot tub with a Playboy model and a sleazy television producer, among others, his hand wrapped around a glass of Scotch and his mind focused on the consequences of Soviet aggression. God bless America! As understood by Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sorkin, who have filleted George Crile’s fascinating 500-page bestseller into a trim and lively history lesson, Wilson is both an anomaly and a paragon. 
A liberal as well as a libertine, he finds common cause (among other satisfactions) with Joanne Herring, a right-wing Houston socialite who loves Jesus and martinis and hates Communism. She is a splendid American contradiction, standing up for liberty and godliness while getting into bed (literally) with a bachelor congressman and (metaphorically) with President Zia  (Om Puri), the military ruler of Pakistan. 
Julia Roberts, as golden as an Oscar statue, incarnates Ms. Herring as if paying tribute at once to Barbara Stanwyck and to the legions of anonymous Julia Roberts impersonators toiling in drag clubs across the land. I mean this entirely as praise: Not many movie stars have the wit or the moxie to embrace the camp elements of their own personas, and the character is clearly something of a performer in her own right. 
The third player in this high-living, hard-partying jihad  is Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a C.I.A. operative whose first appearance in Charlie Wilson’s office sends the movie tipping, momentarily and deliciously, into pure door-slamming farce. Gust, whose Greek blood and rust-belt background make him something of a misfit among the blue bloods of the Agency, is as frustrated as Charlie is by the refusal of the United States to arm the Afghan resistance, and so the two of them cook up an elaborate scheme involving Israel, Pakistan, a belly dancer and a compliant House Subcommittee chairman (Ned Beatty). 
It’s quite a yarn, and the filmmakers relate it with clarity and verve. The film’s high spirits are inseparable from its sober purpose, which is to present a gentle corrective to the idea that American heroism resides only in square-jawed, melancholy stoicism. That has been the preferred post-9/11 stance, and there is some evident nostalgia in “Charlie Wilson’s War” for the simpler world of the 1980s, when the bad guys flew MIGs and American political life was perhaps a touch less sanctimonious. 
But there is nonetheless a bracing, cheering present-day moral to be found in Charlie Wilson’s story, a reminder that high principles are not incompatible with the pleasure principle. The good guys are the ones who know how to have a good time, and who counter the somber certainties of totalitarianism with the conviction that fun is woven into the fabric of freedom. 
“Charlie Wilson’s War” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, drug references and violence.

‽
‽Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story‽,‽“Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” has a good beat and you can dance to it, though mostly you’ll probably just tap your foot. It’s a cleverly packaged story about a patently phony musician — er, John C. Reilly is Dewey Cox — who conquers the nation’s eardrums with a song in his heart, a guitar in his hands and a million clichés in his DNA. He’s a tuneful pastiche: a little bit country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll, topped off with a pinch of Ray Charles, a dash of Buddy Holly and a whole mess of Johnny Cash as filtered through Joaquin Phoenix’s impersonation and mischievously repurposed through the Judd Apatow laugh factory. 
Mr. Apatow wrote the screenplay with the director Jake Kasdan, though given how close the two follow the recent biopic template some credit rightly belongs to the writers of “Ray” and “Walk the Line.” Like those films, “Walk Hard” tells an upbeat story about a great talent who finds renown, but also stumbles into temptation. “Ray” and “Walk the Line” are soft targets, near-parodies of the form, which suits this film just fine since Mr. Apatow and Mr. Kasdan have no plans to burn down the house. Dewey doesn’t shoot up backstage or beat his woman, much less drown in his vomit or hang himself in the family kitchen, as Ian Curtis does in “Control,” the downbeat version of the same old rock ’n’ roll story. 
Born to be mild, Dewey is cuddly and cute, not Iggy or pop. Partly as a consequence, the film is more funny ha-ha than LOL; it’s a smarty-pants satire that mocks and embraces almost every cliché in the biography playbook. The usual characters enter on cue, hitting their marks and the expected emotional notes, including Ma Cox (the wonderful Margo Martindale) and Pa Cox (Raymond J. Barry), who rear  Dewey in a shotgun shack not far from where Ray Charles played in the dirt before he grew up to become Jamie Foxx and win an Academy Award. Like Ray, Dewey is a musical prodigy, and it isn’t long before he’s making the girls swoon. But by then he’s become Buddy Holly with a child bride more befitting Jerry Lee Lewis. 
Mr. Kasdan is an observant student, and “Walk Hard” glitters with recycled biopic verisimilitude, from the cars to the clothes to the nagging first wife (Kristen Wiig) and especially the music. Written by a team of collaborators, the close to 20 songs jump from early rock ’n’ roll (“Take my ha-ha-hand”) to the Johnny Cash-style anthem of the film’s title and a genius Dylan-esque rune delivered in twanging singsong, in which “mailboxes drip like lampposts in the twisted birth canal of the coliseum,” “fairy teapots mask the temper tantrum/O’ say can you see ’em,” “stuffed cabbage is the darling of the Laundromat,” and 
The mouse with the overbite explained 
how the rabbits were ensnared 
’N the skinny scanty sylph trashed the apothecary diplomat 
Inside the three-eyed monkey within inches of his toaster-oven life. 
Dewey’s “Don’t Look Back” period takes place in the black-and-white 1960s familiar from D. A. Pennebaker’s documentary and now, of course, the Todd Haynes-Cate Blanchett take on that same period in “I’m Not There.” Mr. Kasdan shifts visual styles, or at least color schemes, as often as Dewey changes outfits. But despite the kaleidoscopic twirling, time traveling and a giddy visit with the Beatles in India, “Walk Hard” is surprisingly flat. Part of the problem is that it sticks so close to the films that inspired it that it actually echoes some of their flaws. The June Carter-Reese Witherspoon story in “Walk the Line” was pretty much a drag; the sendup in “Walk Hard,” which features Jenna Fischer as Darlene, is so accurate that it is too. 
The reliably enjoyable Mr. Reilly doesn’t bring any real modulation to Dewey or his phases, just good vibrations. He’s fun to hang around, even though I wish he and the film had made room for madness and not only faithful mimicry. Like all of Mr. Apatow’s films, “Walk Hard” is naughty, but it’s also awfully nice, a word that has no place in rock ’n’ roll. Maybe that’s why I kept waiting (hoping) for the Dewey Cox promised in the film’s poster, which shows Mr. Reilly — in homage to Jim Morrison — wearing only a necklace and a goofy, what-me-worry gape. He still looks more like Alfred E. Neuman than the Lizard King, true, but there he also seems on the actual verge of letting it all hang out. 
“Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.

‽
‽National Treasure: Book of Secrets‽,‽The hyperactive sequel “National Treasure: Book of Secrets” sends its archaeologist hero, Ben Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage, flexing his deadpan), on a globetrotting quest that might have been devised after a long night of Wikipedia surfing. 
Returning characters include Ben’s archaeologist daddy, Patrick Gates (the improbably dignified Jon Voight); Ben’s techie sidekick, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), who extricates Ben from impossible situations and serves up expository softballs; and Ben’s now-ex-girlfriend, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), whose dalliance with the press secretary (Ty Burrell) of the president of the United States enables the gang to hunt for clues in the Oval Office. 
New faces include Patrick’s ex-wife, Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), a scholar of ancient languages, who is sly and sexy even while translating pre-Columbian glyphs; and a rival archaeologist and Confederate sympathizer named Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), who brazenly accuses a Gates ancestor, Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch), of collaborating with Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth. 
Booth just happened to shoot Lincoln on the same night that he and a co-conspirator pressured Thomas Gates into translating a diary page that disclosed the location of Cibola, the fabled lost city of gold. To clear the Gates family name, the good guys must prove the existence of Cibola by finding the long-dispersed fragments of a map, one of which is hidden in a compendium of secrets handed down from president to president. 
To acquire the cleverly named Book of Secrets, Ben plots to kidnap the current president (Bruce Greenwood) and blah, blah, blah purple monkey dishwasher. 
Like its predecessor, “National Treasure,” this sequel amounts to a bunch of crossword puzzle answers stitched together with explosions, chases and displays of intuitive reasoning that the “Twin Peaks” F.B.I. agent Dale Cooper would reject as too right-brained. 
Granted, coherence and plausibility matter as much here as they did in the Indiana Jones films and “North by Northwest” (a film whose Mount Rushmore set piece “Book of Secrets” unwisely invokes). But Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock’s escapist pictures were more than time wasters. They offered dreamily intense predicaments, lived-in relationships (like Indy’s with his estranged father in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”), for which the prickly banter of Ben and Patrick is a pale substitute, and action scenes built from dynamic shots that interlocked like stained-glass window panels. 
As directed (covered, really) by Jon Turteltaub, the “National Treasure” films substitute trivia for poetry and busyness for thrills. The protracted climax of “Book of Secrets,” set in a dimly lighted, waterlogged Cibola (you thought they wouldn’t find it?), plays like a promotional reel for a forthcoming Disney World attraction. A London car chase that should be nerve-racking is merely noisy. 
The best one can say for this franchise is that almost every character is educated and proud of it. Even the brusque Parisian cops who interrupt Ben and Riley’s inspection of the Statue of Liberty in Paris can’t resist joining Ben in a discussion of the Baron de Montesquieu’s role in creating constitutional democracy. 
Such eccentricities are welcome, but they can’t approach memories of Indy outrunning a boulder and Eva Marie Saint dangling near George Washington’s face. 
“National Treasure: Book of Secrets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for bloodless violence and mild innuendo.

‽
‽P.S. I Love You‽,‽It would be easy to dismiss “P.S. I Love You,” about the agonies visited on a young married couple, as the big-screen equivalent of a paperback romance. Certainly the refined critical mind understands that this is the kind of artful emotion machine that the movies have been making since the very first tear slid down an actress’s face, the droplet seen — and experienced — around the world by audiences who answered that bead of dew with a grateful flood of their own. Cry us a river, Mary Pickford! 
Movies that make you bawl were sometimes called five-hankie weepies, a sneery label calculated to insult the film and the teary filmgoer alike. There aren’t a lot of these made anymore in America, mainly because most of our movies now are about men and not women. Even so, there are plenty of covert male weepies, films that transform emotions into actions, including acts of violence. “Michael Clayton” is a male weepy, as is “American Gangster,” which turns a duel between tough guys into a veritable drum circle of two. “P.S. I Love You” is more obviously a weepy, but because it leavens sorrow with laughter, it probably requires no more than three hankies. I wouldn’t know: I just used the back of my hand. 
The film stars Hilary Swank, a square-jawed beauty at once angular and bosomy, vaguely masculine and unequivocally feminine, whose greatest roles — in “Boys Don’t Cry” and in particular “Million Dollar Baby” — have exploited her ambiguous physicality to enormous advantage. Like some of the greatest sob sisters of the big screen — think of Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford — she has a kind of working-class toughness bordering on hardness that makes the eventual cracks in her armature all the more effective. Unlike Stanwyck and Crawford, though, Ms. Swank can come across as intensely, almost desperately eager to please, which invests her with tremulous pathos or makes you feel embarrassed on her behalf. Stanwyck would have booted her offscreen. Crawford would have eaten her for breakfast. 
Perhaps because of this masculine-feminine ambiguity, Ms. Swank has not often been cast as a romantic foil opposite men. She wooed another woman beautifully in “Boys Don’t Cry,” and in “Million Dollar Baby” played the adoring daughter to a surrogate father, a symbolic romance conducted principally inside the confines of a boxing ring. One reason she was so good in Brian De Palma’s convoluted noir “The Black Dahlia,” in which she crept around like poison ivy, is that her performance as a femme fatale is set inside quotation marks. She didn’t register as a toxically dangerous woman but as an idea of that irresistible sexist cliché. She filled out her character’s snug gown as  a drag queen would. 
“P.S. I Love You” looks squeaky clean and utterly straight and very much removed from the shadow worlds in which Ms. Swank has done her best work. Yet as directed by Richard LaGravenese, who shares screenwriting credit with Steven Rogers, it has a curious morbid quality. Ms. Swank plays Holly Kennedy, a 29-year-old New Yorker who, shortly after the story takes off, becomes a widow. Her husband, Gerry (Gerard Butler), however, doesn’t fully disappear. Instead he visibly lingers in her apartment — he seems less like a ghost than like a manifestation of mad grief  — and in the letters he left behind. These letters are full of bossy instructions for Holly on how to grieve and live. They are, in essence, a primer on how to be a widow. 
Mr. LaGravenese, who last directed Ms. Swank in the sympathetic drama “Freedom Writers,” is in sync with his star from the get-go. He puts her in the middle of the frame and in a succession of mostly flattering outfits, and smartly surrounds her with well-ripened second bananas, notably Kathy Bates, as Holly’s protective mother, and Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon, as her best friends. Harry Connick Jr. swings in and out as a possible love interest, as does the temperature-raiser Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a television actor (“Grey’s Anatomy,” “Weeds”) who bears a striking physical resemblance to Javier Bardem. Mr. Morgan’s appearance in “P. S. I Love You” finishes off Mr. Butler (last seen slaughtering Persians in “300”) far more effectively than does Gerry’s terminal illness. 
“P. S. I Love You” won’t win any awards; it isn’t the sort of work that flatters a critic’s taste. It’s preposterous in big and small matters (Holly complains about a Lower East Side apartment that any sane New Yorker would kill for), and there are several cringe-worthy set pieces, some involving Mr. Butler and a guitar. The film is not a beautiful object or a memorable cultural one, and yet it charms, however awkwardly. Ms. Swank’s ardent sincerity and naked emotionalism dovetail nicely with Mr. LaGravenese’s melodramatic excesses: Together the director and his star create a swell of feeling that helps blunt your reservations about being played as an easy mark, a sap or, worse, a girl, even if that’s exactly what you are. 
“P.S. I Love You” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Caution: this film may cause sniffles. 
‽
‽The District‽,‽The Hungarian cartoon feature “The District!” is a last-minute shoo-in for the title of 2007’s most original animated film, no small triumph in a year that also included  the releases of “Persepolis,” “Ratatouille,” “Beowulf” and “Paprika.” 
The movie is a sexually explicit, scabrously funny portrait of multiethnic European urban culture, similar to Ralph Bakshi’s early-1970s adults-only animated movies “Fritz the Cat” and “Heavy Traffic,” but richer and more coherent than either of those. It’s set in contemporary Budapest, where a group of streetwise Hungarian teenagers use a time machine (invented by their school’s resident nerd genius) to travel back to the prehistoric era and bury mammoths beneath what will eventually become their city’s streets. 
They plan to return to the present and drill those spots for oil, but that get-rich-quick scheme is complicated by the attentions of Vladimir V. Putin, Tony Blair and George W. Bush (who, in a bit of satire Michael Moore would enjoy, adds Hungary to his list of oil-rich nations worth attacking). 
Beyond goofy geopolitical riffing, “The District!” also offers a gangsta-flavored, surprisingly heartfelt update of “Romeo and Juliet” filled with loving directorial nods to “West Side Story” and Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing.” The cartoon’s trash-talking hero, Ricsi Lakatos, affiliated with a Gypsy street gang, hatches the time-travel plot, hoping to acquire enough money to win the beautiful but ethnically off-limits Julika Csorba, a Hungarian gang boss’s daughter. 
Their star-crossed romance and the social tension enfolding it are expressed in verbally acrobatic hip-hop numbers, envisioned by Aron Gauder, the director, with a mix of direct-address close-ups and anime-inspired combat poses, complete with blurred backgrounds. 
On top of its other considerable achievements, this is a dazzlingly assured piece of filmmaking. Merging seemingly hand-drawn, two-dimensional characters and deep-focus, intricately shadowed, simulated 3-D backdrops, “The District!” is like a dirty, thrilling pop-up book  you can step into. 
‽
‽The Singing Revolution‽,‽Can singing change history? “The Singing Revolution,” a documentary by James Tusty and Maureen Castle Tusty about Estonia’s struggle to end Soviet occupation, shows that it already has. 
The first part of “Revolution” provides a thumbnail  sketch of 20th-century Estonian history, and it’s not pretty. This small nation was a satellite state of the former Soviet Union for much of  that time, except for a brief period when the Germans controlled it. 
Under the Soviets, especially, Estonian culture was brutishly suppressed, but it welled up every five years in July, when Estonians gathered in Tallinn for the Estonian song festival, which often drew upward of 25,000 people. The  images  of these festivals  are moving already; the force of the singers and the precision of their conductors are stunning to behold. 
But the emotion swells further when Estonians defy their occupiers by singing nationalist songs. This bold act reclaimed Estonian identity and set the stage for a series of increasingly daring rebellions under the Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who advocated glasnost and got more than he bargained for. 
Imagine the scene in “Casablanca” in which the French patrons sing “La Marseillaise” in defiance of the Germans, then multiply its power by a factor of thousands, and you’ve only begun to imagine the force of “The Singing Revolution.”

After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Mamo (Ismail Ghaffari), a famed Kurdish musician living in Iran, gathers his many sons for a trip across the border to Iraqi Kurdistan and a long-planned celebratory concert. Despite failing health and his offspring’s fluctuating commitment to the dangerous enterprise, Mamo is resolute; neither callous border guards nor his own recurring premonitions of disaster will derail the performance. 
Fateful and funny, haunting and magical, “Half Moon” balances delicately between the harsh realities of its location and the mystical power of Mamo’s visions. Shooting mainly in Iranian Kurdistan, the cinematographers Nigel Bluck and Crighton Bone find an unearthly beauty amid the gambling frenzy of a cockfight and the silent ranks of exiled female singers lining the rooftops of a mountain village. As the end of the journey draws near, the line between the natural and the supernatural becomes increasingly difficult to discern. 
Inspired by Mozart’s “Requiem” and commissioned by the New Crowned Hope festival in Vienna, “Half Moon” is an affecting contemplation of resilience in the face of tragedy. When a higher purpose beckons, death itself must take a back seat.

‽
‽I Am Legend‽,‽“Not if you were the last man on earth!” Plenty of guys have heard that line at some point in their lives, but it’s unlikely that Will Smith is one. His irresistible charm has been proved, above all, by his ability to attract audiences to bad movies like “Hitch” and “Wild Wild West,” as well as to better ones like “Ali” and “The Pursuit of Happyness.” In spite of its third-act collapse into obviousness and sentimentality, “I Am Legend” — in which Mr. Smith plays somebody with every reason to believe that he really is the last man on earth — is among the better ones. 
And this star, whose amiability makes him easy to underestimate as an actor, deserves his share of the credit. There are not many performers who can make themselves interesting in isolation, without human supporting players. Tom Hanks did it in “Cast Away,” with only a volleyball as his buddy, foil and straight man. Mr. Smith has a few more companions, including an expressive German shepherd, some department store mannequins and a high-powered rifle. (There are also some flesh-eating, virus-crazed zombies, about which more in a moment.) But it is the charismatic force of his personality that makes his character’s radical solitude scary and fascinating, as well as strangely appealing. 
In this Mr. Smith is helped, and to some degree upstaged, by the island of Manhattan, which the movie’s director, Francis Lawrence, has turned into a post-apocalyptic wilderness. Three years after an epidemic has caused the evacuation and quarantine of New York City, Robert Neville (Mr. Smith) is its sole diurnal human resident, and he spends his days roaming its desolate neighborhoods, at once wary and carefree. The streetscapes he wanders through will be familiar to any visitor or resident, but the way Mr. Lawrence and his team of digital-effects artists have distressed and depopulated New York is downright uncanny. Weeds poke up through the streets, which are piled with abandoned cars, and a slow, visible process of decay has set in. 
A nightmare, of course, but not without its enchantments. In some ways Neville, dwelling in a highly developed urban space that is also a wilderness, experiences the best of both worlds. From his home base in the elegant Washington Square town house he was lucky enough to own (on a government employee’s salary) before the big die-off, he makes daylight forays that are like an adventure-tourist fantasy. He does a little deer hunting on Park Avenue and some indoor fishing at the Temple of Dendur, picks fresh corn in Central Park and smacks golf balls across the Hudson from the deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid. 
Mr. Lawrence, who previously directed the hectic, obnoxious “Constantine” and many music videos, uses elaborate, computer-assisted means to create simple, striking effects. While “I Am Legend,” the latest in a series of film versions of a novel by Richard Matheson, fits comfortably within the conventions of the sci-fi horror genre — here come those zombies! — it mixes dread and suspense with contemplative, almost pastoral moods. And without taking itself too seriously, the movie, written by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich, does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization. 
Neville, a scientist and a soldier, constitutes a civilization of one. His daily routines are at once practical — he wants to find a cure for the virus that wiped everyone else out, and he needs to be home before sundown — and spiritual. Under the streets of the city and in its empty buildings are the infected, transformed by the virus into pale, hairless, light-allergic cannibals. “Social de-evolution appears to be complete,” Neville observes as he makes notes in his basement lab. And his habits are a way not only of protecting himself from the zombies, but also of maintaining the distinction between them and him. 
The zombies, like the rabid dogs that are their companions, nonetheless display rudimentary pack behavior and are even able to set traps and make plans. Once they begin swarming, “I Am Legend” inevitably loses some of its haunting originality, since they look a lot like the monsters in “28 Days Later” (and its sequel, “28 Weeks Later”). They also represent a less compelling application of computer-generated imagery than all those empty avenues and silent buildings. 
And in its last section “I Am Legend” reverts to generic type, with chases and explosions and a redemptive softening of its bleak premise. The presence of the lovely Brazilian actress Alice Braga does seem promising; if she and Mr. Smith were to reboot the species together, Humanity 2.0 would be quite a bit sexier than the present version, as well as friendlier. But really the movie is best when its hero is on his own, and Mr. Smith, walking in the footsteps of Vincent Price and Charlton Heston, who played earlier versions of the Robert Neville character, outdoes both of them. There is something graceful and effortless about this performance, which not only shows what it might feel like to be the last man on earth, but also demonstrates what it is to be a movie star. 
“I Am Legend” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has virus-crazed, flesh-eating zombies.

‽Alvin and the Chipmunks‽,‽Hollywood continues its tired milking of old television properties with “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” a slick updating of the musical-cartoon franchise created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. in 1958. Remodeled over the years on television and recordings, the ’munks have been given a digital coat of paint this time out, but the movie doesn’t skimp — lasso those nostalgic parents! — on the memories of old. 
Jason Lee (doing a perfect “Alvin. Alvin! Alvin!”) plays David Seville, a rejected songwriter who meets the mischievous Alvin, brainy Simon and pudgy Theodore, transplanted tree dwellers who have raided his kitchen. When he discovers their unique vocal harmonies, he’s off to a record executive (a delightfully despicable, movie-stealing David Cross), who whisks the trio away to exploit their talent for all it’s worth. 
As fans of the television series know, Dave is the critters’ surrogate dad, and the film concerns his need to embrace that responsibility and save the boys from a showbiz life they’re too young for. The movie gets mileage out of the chestnuts “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late)” and “Witch Doctor” (you remember: “Oo-ee, oo-ah-ah, ting-tang, walla-walla, bing-bang”), its digs at the music industry and the cheap laughs of the big-beseeching-eye effect of Puss in Boots in the “Shrek” movies. 
But, alas, its animated protagonists are egregiously eclipsed by the live-action characters. Despite its shout-outs to the holiday season, this is essentially airplane fodder, not a perennial. Don’t hold your breath waiting for the sequel. 
“Alvin and the Chipmunks” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some mild rude humor. 
ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS

‽The Perfect Holiday‽,‽In “The Perfect Holiday” Nancy (Gabrielle Union), a divorced mother of two boys and a girl, glumly faces Christmas in New Jersey without a man in her life. Rubbing salt in her wounds is her ex-husband, J-Jizzy (Charlie  Murphy), a preening rap star with whom she is locked in a custody battle. Swathed in chinchilla, he is stymied on his current project, a Christmas album that includes gems like “I Love the Ho Ho Hos.” 
When Nancy’s daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), overhears Mom confiding to a friend that all she wants for Christmas is a compliment from a man, she passes along the wish to the handsome Santa at the local mall. In real life he is Benjamin (Morris Chestnut), a conveniently unmarried, struggling songwriter whose latest opus, a squishy mound of seasonal goo of the sort J-Jizzy could never write, reaches the rapper’s hands at an opportune moment. 
Benjamin, who noticed Nancy at the mall, takes Emily’s cue, tracks down the mother and delivers the requested compliment, then disappears. Nancy and her posse eventually find him, and romance blossoms. The only obstacle to happily-ever-after is Nancy’s older son, John-John (Malik Hammond), who takes an instant loathing to Benjamin. But the chances that Santa is Mr. Right are about as good as those of hearing “Jingle Bells” in a department store during the Christmas season. 
Santa and J-Jizzy each have comic sidekicks. Santa’s is Jamal (Faizon Love), a plus-size elf who, when called upon, has trouble squeezing into a Santa suit, and Jizzy’s is his exasperated manager, Delicious (Katt Williams).  Lurking on the sidelines are Queen Latifah as the unctuous Christmas angel who narrates the story, and Terrence Howard as her troublemaking opposite, Bah-Humbug. 
“The Perfect Holiday,” directed by Lance Rivera, is that most dispiriting product, a formulaic movie that doesn’t believe in itself. The farcical contortions are stiff, the jokes flat, the romance half-baked, the acting rote and the familial bonhomie lukewarm. Watching the movie is like reaching into a Christmas stocking and pulling out handfuls of cheap plastic toys that are broken. 
“The Perfect Holiday”  is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some mildly off-color humor.

‽The Golden Compass‽,‽A fantastic bestiary inhabits “The Golden Compass,” prowling and flapping and slithering and fluttering. The animals, most of which are called daemons and are manifestations of the human soul, hover at the side of their people and near the story’s edge, where their coos and barks mix with the ambient clatter and clang. Every so often, an animal leaps forward, its fur raised in alarm, its feathers fanned in flight. And because these are no ordinary animals, they also offer words of comfort, advice, warning. In this otherworldly realm, humans have no dominion over these creatures, yet they are not merely equals, either. They are one. 
This beastly attitude and the conception of the soul as being somehow separate from its corporeal vessel are, as far as I can tell, the most irreligious conceits in the movie adaptation of “The Golden Compass,” a novel that was first published in Britain as  “Northern Lights.”  Written by Philip Pullman, it quickly became a critical and commercial success for the most obvious of reasons: It’s a charming romp set in a parallel universe stuffed with magical creatures, spooky villains and mythopoetic conceits, and propelled by a young  orphan, Lyra Belacqua, who embarks on the hero’s journey with her shape-shifting daemon, Pantalaimon (Pan for short). The book has attracted voluble criticism for equally obvious reasons: Its army of darkness is a totalitarian institution called “the Church.” 
That ecclesiastical entity is pretty much nowhere evident in the film, which otherwise hews as close to the original source as can be expected from a 114-minute, big-screen translation of a 400-or-so-page novel. Directed by the American Chris Weitz, who wrote the heavily condensed script, “The Golden Compass” has many of the virtues of a faithful screen adaptation and many of the predictable flaws. Agnostics and atheists may, for starters, regret the explicit absence of the Church (others may see lingering traces), but the movies have never been a particularly good pulpit for any gods other than those of cinema’s own creation. It’s a tradition that this film honors with a goddess of icy perfection played by the wickedly well-cast Nicole Kidman. 
As Mrs. Coulter, an emissary of the reigning powers (known only as “the Magisterium” in the film), Ms. Kidman has rarely looked more beautifully and exotically alien. When she first appears, she pours across the screen like liquid gold, her body provocatively shifting inside a shimmering, form-fitting gown, her gilt-blond hair and alabaster skin all but glowing. She’s the film’s most spectacular special effect (her wonderfully vicious little daemon-monkey runs a close second), and for once, the smooth planes of her face, untroubled by visible lines, serve the character. This masklike countenance  helps hide Mrs. Coulter’s malignant designs from Lyra (the newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, spunky and serviceable), who, not long after the story lifts off, falls into her care through a series of complicated developments. 
Mr. Weitz crams so many events, characters (computer-generated and otherwise), twists and turns, sumptuously appointed rooms and ethereally strange vistas into his film that he risks losing you in the whirl. It zips from the Gothic grandeur of Jordan College, the Oxford institution where Lyra has been raised and somewhat educated by her guardians (“Scholars”), to Mrs. Coulter’s swank London home, where the Art Deco touches bring to mind the dreamiest Astaire-and-Rogers cheek-to-cheek. Much like the neo-Victorian aristocrats in Neal Stephenson’s science-fiction novel “The Diamond Age,” the characters in “The Golden Compass” populate a world that resembles our own,  despite being also seductively foreign. In Lyra’s universe zeppelins putt-putt through a period twilight zone, evoking both a knowable past and a possible future. 
Despite the pit stops and lovely clutter, some of it visibly influenced by David Lynch’s “Dune,” the story unwinds in fairly straightforward fashion. Lyra, using a nifty, compasslike device called an alethiometer, must face danger and destiny, along with some hard truths. Among the hardest and headiest are those involving her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), an adventurer who dashes in and out of her life accompanied by an elegant snow leopard for a daemon. Aided and abetted by assorted quirky types and acting legends (Tom Courtenay in person, Ian McKellen in voice), Lyra follows Lord Asriel to the snowy north, where further perils await, along with a creepy intrigue involving stolen children and hints that the book’s two sequels are ready for their big-screen close-ups. 
The sequels are a welcome idea, if only because they might persuade Mr. Weitz and his team to take it slower next time. “The Golden Compass” is an honorable work and especially impressive, given the far smaller, more intimate scale of his last film as a director (with his brother, Paul), “About a Boy.”  But it’s hampered by its fealty to the book and its madly rushed pace, which forces you to dash through the story like Lord Asriel. 
Among other things, I would have liked to spend some quality time with Lyra’s friend and protector the warrior bear Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Mr. McKellen), a gorgeous creature whose ferocity is, alas, tempered by his resemblance to some familiar cuddly polar bears. It is, I discovered, hard to keep your mind off the concession stand when you are waiting for Iorek to offer Lyra a Coke. 
“The Golden Compass” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some intense scenes involve children in danger and warfare between bears and humans.

‽
‽Juno‽,‽Juno MacGuff, the title character of Jason Reitman’s new film, is 16 and pregnant, but “Juno” could not be further from the kind of hand-wringing, moralizing melodrama that such a condition might suggest. Juno, played by the poised, frighteningly talented Ellen Page, is too odd and too smart to be either a case study or the object of leering disapproval. She assesses her problem, and weighs her response to it, with disconcerting sang-froid. 
It’s not that Juno treats her pregnancy as a joke, but rather that in the sardonic spirit of the screenwriter, Diablo Cody, she can’t help finding humor in it. Tiny of frame and huge of belly, Juno utters wisecracks as if they were breathing exercises, referring to herself as “the cautionary whale.” 
At first her sarcasm is bracing and also a bit jarring — “Hello, I’d like to procure a hasty abortion,” she says when she calls  a women’s health clinic — but as “Juno” follows her from pregnancy test to delivery room (and hastily retreats from the prospect of abortion), it takes on surprising delicacy and emotional depth. The snappy one-liners are a brilliant distraction, Ms. Cody’s way of clearing your throat for the lump you’re likely to find there in the movie’s last scenes. 
The first time I saw “Juno,” I was shocked to find myself tearing up at the end, since I’d spent the first 15 minutes or so gnashing my teeth and checking my watch. The passive-aggressive pseudo-folk songs, the self-consciously clever dialogue, the generic, instantly mockable suburban setting — if you can find Sundance on a map, you’ll swear you’ve been here before. 
But “Juno” (which played at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals, not the one in Park City, Utah) respects the idiosyncrasies of its characters rather than exaggerating them or holding them up for ridicule. And like Juno herself, the film outgrows its own mannerisms and defenses, evolving from a coy, knowing farce into a heartfelt, serious comedy. 
A good deal of the credit for this goes to Ms. Page, a 20-year-old Canadian who is able to seem, in the space of a single scene, mature beyond her years and disarmingly childlike. The naïveté that peeks through her flippant, wised-up facade is essential, since part of the movie’s point is that Juno is not quite as smart or as capable as she thinks she is. 
It’s not simply that she has impulsive, unprotected sex with her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), or that she decides, against the advice of parents and friends, to have the baby and give it up for adoption. These, indeed, are choices she is prepared to defend and to live with. Rather, Juno’s immaturity resides in her familiar adolescent assumption that she understands the world better than her elders do, and that she can finesse the unintended consequences of her decisions. 
The grown-ups, at first, seem like familiar caricatures of adolescent-centered cinema: square, sad and clueless. But Juno’s father (J. K. Simmons) and step-mother (Allison Janney) turn out to be complicated, intelligent people, too, and not just because they are played by two of the best character actors around. Ms. Cody’s script and Mr. Reitman’s understated, observant direction allow the personalities of the characters to emerge slowly, and to change in credible and unpredictable ways. 
This is especially true of Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), the baby’s potential adoptive parents. The audience’s initial impression of them, like Juno’s, is of stereotypically smug yuppies trapped in rickety conventions of heterosexual domesticity. Vanessa is uptight and materialistic, while Mark tends the guttering flame of his youthful hipness, watching cult horror movies and trading alternative-rock mix CDs with Juno. 
Juno is, on the surface at least, a familiar type, surrounding herself with and expressing herself by means of kitschy consumer detritus (she calls the clinic on a hamburger phone) and pop cultural ephemera. She could be the hero of a Judd Apatow comedy (like, say, Mr. Cera, the boneless wonder of “Superbad” and a purely delightful presence here). Except, of course, that she’s female. Ms. Cody, Mr. Reitman and Ms. Page have conspired, intentionally or not, to produce a feminist, girl-powered rejoinder and complement to “Knocked Up.” Despite what most products of the Hollywood comedy boys’ club would have you believe,  it is possible to possess both a uterus and a sense of humor. 
“Juno” also shares with “Knocked Up” an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood. It follows its heroine — and by the end she has earned that title — on a twisty path toward responsibility and greater self-understanding. 
This is the course followed by most coming-of-age stories,  though not many  are so daring in their treatment of teenage pregnancy, which this film flirts with presenting not just as bearable but attractive. Kids, please! Heed the cautionary whale.  But in the meantime, have a good time at “Juno.” Bring your parents, too. 
“Juno” is,  somewhat remarkably,  rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations, obviously, but no nudity or violence and not much swearing.

‽We Pedal Uphill‽,‽Applying a microscope to 21st-century America, “We Pedal Uphill: Stories From the States 2001-2008” sees a country mired in paranoia, injustice and intolerance. 
Arranged in 13 fictional vignettes, each unfolding in a different state, the movie slides smoothly from racism in Tennessee to election fraud in Ohio, from corporate greed in Oklahoma to railroad chicanery in Nebraska. The performances are across-the-board solid (most of the cast is theater-based), and although the quality of the segments varies, the thoughtfulness of the writing (by Roland Tec, who also directs) does much to atone for the monochromatic palette and rudimentary camerawork. 
As a concerned overview of the post-Sept. 11 political landscape, “We Pedal Uphill” balances the heavy-handed (a liberal talk-radio host looking beneath his car for explosives) and the delicate (a camera tracking backward through an abandoned factory, while the voices of long-gone employees chatter eerily on the soundtrack). 
In the film’s most compelling story, a Massachusetts librarian discovers the perils of resisting the Patriot Act, and it’s well worth straining your eyes to see the title of the book she’s reading in the final scene. 
Neither self-righteous nor bombastic, these wide-ranging mini-tales coast on a gently insistent tone of regret. Without pointing fingers or naming names, Mr. Tec reminds us that change does not happen overnight.

‽Pageant‽,‽“Pageant” goes behind the scenes, dreams, breakdowns, freakouts, sequins, glitter and fabulous falsies of the Miss Gay America pageant, an annual competition for female impersonators who are every bit as dedicated (and hysterical) as mainstream beauty queens. 
And they are also, within the context of drag, just as traditional as their scepter-wielding sisters. Not for these divas the punk-inflected stylings you find on the cutting edge of the drag scene. This is female impersonation of the old school: lip-synching, Hollywood glamour, Liza, Judy and Fosse, Fosse, Fosse! 
This classicism is not without its charm, and it’s touching, in a goofy sort of way, to see how seriously everyone takes it. Directed by Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern, “Pageant” follows a manicured handful of fiercely committed drag masters with their eyes on the prize: a tiara, scepter, seven grand in cash and the priceless claim on bragging rights as America’s queen supreme. 
Supported by family, friends and leopard-print stilettos, the hopefuls primp and tuck and rehearse their routines en route to the 34th competition in Memphis. The location inspires one contestant to call for a moment of silence for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but for the most part the festivities are more in line with the pantomime by a plus-size diva (“Call me Pork Chop — everybody does!”) to an inevitable round of “And I Am Telling You.” Dream, girl, dream.

‽The Curious Case of Benjamin Button‽,‽“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” which occupies around 25 pages in the collected works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a slender piece of whimsy, a charming fantasy about a man who ages in reverse, descending through the years from newborn senescence to terminal infancy. As Fitzgerald unravels it, Benjamin’s story serves as the pretext for some amusing, fairly superficial observations about child rearing, undergraduate behavior and courtship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
From this odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source. “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” more than two and a half hours long, sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist’s condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald. 
While the film’s plot progresses, with a few divagations, in a straight line through the decades of Benjamin Button’s life, the backward vector of that biography turns this “Curious Case” into a genuine mystery. And the puzzles it invites us to contemplate — in consistently interesting, if not always dramatically satisfying ways — are deep and imposing, concerning the passage of time, the elusiveness of experience and the Janus-faced nature of love. 
Above all, though, “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is a triumph of technique. Building on the advances of pioneers like Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and Robert Zemeckis — and on his own previous work adapting newfangled means to traditional cinematic ends — Mr. Fincher (“Fight Club,” “Zodiac”) has added a dimension of delicacy and grace to digital filmmaking. While it stands on the shoulders of breakthroughs like “Minority Report,” “The Lord of the Rings” and “Forrest Gump” (for which Mr. Roth wrote the screenplay), “Benjamin Button” may be the most dazzling such hybrid yet, precisely because it is the subtlest. While he does treat the audience to a few grand, special-effect showpieces, Mr. Fincher concentrates his ingenuity on the setting and the characters, in particular — and most arrestingly — on the faces of his stars, Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt. 
Ms. Blanchett is Daisy, a dancer, bohemian and all-around free spirit who ages gracefully, before our eyes, into a stately modern matron and then into a wasted, breathless old woman. Mr. Pitt, for the most part, plays Benjamin, who is born, looking like a man in his 70s, into a prominent New Orleans family in 1918. I say for the most part because near the end of the movie Mr. Pitt is replaced by younger and younger children and also because, at the beginning, he is evoked by an uncanny computer-generated confection that seems to have been distilled from his essence. This creature, tiny and wizened, is at once boy and man, but in every scene the ratio is readjusted, until the strapping figure of a familiar movie star emerges, gradually and all but imperceptibly. 
The inner life of Benjamin Button, abandoned at birth by his stricken father (Jason Flemyng) and raised by the infinitely kind caretaker of a nursing home (Taraji P. Henson), is harder to grasp than his outer appearance, in part because Mr. Pitt seems more interested in the nuances of reticence than in the dynamics of expression. It’s true that Benjamin’s condition imposes a certain detachment: he is at once innocent and ancient, almost never who he appears to be. 
But even though Mr. Pitt’s coolness is a perfectly defensible approach to this character, his elusiveness, from one film to the next, is starting to look more defensive than daring. His recent performances have been devoted mainly to the study of his own magnetism, a quality he earnestly explores in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” and playfully subverts in “Burn After Reading.” It goes without saying that Mr. Pitt has charisma to burn, and he is a capable and inventive actor, but he will only be a great one if he risks breaking himself open on screen as he did, briefly, in “Babel.” 
And so, while Benjamin’s progress through life drives the narrative of “The Curious Case,” he is (as the title suggests) more an object of contemplation than a flesh-and-blood (or bit-and-byte) candidate for our empathy. His jaunt through the 20th century is certainly fun to watch, with an episodic rhythm that recalls old movie serials or, even more, the endlessly dilated adventures of newspaper comic-strip heroes. After some initiation into the pleasures of the flesh and the bottle in the city of his birth, Young Button (Old Button) hires onto a tramp steamer. He tarries a while in Russia, sampling caviar and adultery (with a superbly soignée Tilda Swinton) before World War II intrudes. 
Later there will be sailboats and motorcycles as the ambient light turns gold along with Mr. Pitt’s hair. There will not be much in the way of big events or public happenings — Benjamin Button is, finally, no Forrest Gump — and though he is a white Southerner raised by a black woman, he seems untouched by racial turmoil or by much of anything beyond the mysteries of his peculiar destiny. 
But the movie’s emotional center of gravity — the character who struggles and changes and feels — is Daisy, played by Ms. Blanchett from impetuous ingénue to near ghost with an almost otherworldly mixture of hauteur and heat. The story of Benjamin’s life is read to Daisy by her daughter (Julia Ormond) in a New Orleans hospital room in 2005, just as Hurricane Katrina is approaching the city. The imminence of the storm is a superfluous and unduly portentous device, since Katrina brings to mind precisely the hard, real-life miseries the movie has done everything in its power to avoid. 
That power, though, is something to be reckoned with, and it resides in Mr. Fincher’s ability to use his unbelievable skills to turn an incredible conceit into a plausible love story. The romance between Daisy and Benjamin begins when both are chronologically pre-adolescents and Benjamin is, physically, a codger, but the initial element of pedophilic creepiness in the relationship gives way to other forms of awkwardness. Their love is uniquely perfect and enduring. At the same time, like any other love — like any movie — it is shadowed by disappointment and fated to end. In the case of “Benjamin Button,” I was sorry when it was over and happy to have seen it. 
“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scenes of sex and violence.

‽
‽Valkyrie‽,‽There are no discernibly nasty Nazis in “Valkyrie,” though Hitler and Goebbels skulk about in a few scenes, shooting dark, ominous looks at the heroic German Army officer played by Tom Cruise. Perhaps they’re wondering what this Hollywood megastar is doing in their midst, a sentiment that you may come to share while watching Mr. Cruise  —  who gives a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor  —  strut about as one of history’s more enigmatic players. 
That enigma was Claus von Stauffenberg, a count and a colonel   who, though he lost one eye, an entire hand and several fingers while fighting on behalf of the Reich, made several attempts to assassinate Hitler and seize control of the government. At the core of  Stauffenberg’s spectacularly ambitious plot was Valkyrie,  Hitler’s plan  for the mobilization of the home army that  Stauffenberg hoped to hijack in order to quash the SS and its leaders.  It didn’t work, of course, for  complicated reasons, though also because by 1944, as William L. Shirer bluntly puts it in “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,” the conspirators were “terribly late.” 
You don’t learn how belated the  coup d’état was in “Valkyrie,” which might matter if  this  big-ticket production with Mr. Cruise in an eye patch and shiny, shiny boots had something to do with reality. But the director, Bryan Singer (of the “X-Men” franchise), and the writers, Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, aren’t interested in delivering a history lesson: that’s why Ken Burns was born. Slick, facile entertainment is the name of the game here, as it is in all Mr. Singer’s films, including “Apt Pupil” (about a Nazi war criminal and the American boy next door who outs him) and “The Usual Suspects,” an  intricately plotted story with men and guns, secrets and shadows that Mr. McQuarrie wrote. The secrets have already begun swirling by the time “Valkyrie” opens with Stauffenberg, stationed in North Africa, bitterly recording his opposition to Hitler in a diary right before losing various body parts to the war. After his convalescence he meets Maj. Gen.  Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), who, sometime earlier, tries to blow up Hitler with a bomb hidden in bottles of French liqueur. (Russian vodka might have been more effective.) Stauffenberg soon joins the conspiratorial party that includes other British class acts brandishing high military rank and speaking in lightly accented or unaccented English: Bill Nighy as Gen.  Friedrich Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm, Terence Stamp as Gen.  Ludwig Beck and Eddie Izzard as Gen. Erich Fellgiebel. 
Most of the crucial rebellious officers are played by British actors, while some of the Nazi diehards are played by Germans, which wouldn’t be worth mentioning if this cacophony of accents weren’t so distracting. But, as with the casting of Mr. Cruise, whose German voice-over quickly eases into English, this international acting community invokes an earlier studio age, when Peter Lorre and Claude Rains delivered their lines in exotically flavored English and everyone pretended that Rick’s Cafe really was located in Casablanca and not on a back lot. If Mr. Cruise doesn’t work in “Valkyrie,” it’s partly because he’s too modern, too American and way too Tom Cruise to make sense in the role, but also because what passes for movie realism keeps changing, sometimes faster than even a star can change his brand. 
Though Mr. Singer’s old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily. Hitler (David Bamber) doesn’t need spooky music or low camera angles to be villainous: he just has to show up. Mr. Singer’s fondness for exaggeration can even undercut his strongest scenes, as when Stauffenberg visits Hitler to secure approval for the rewritten Valkyrie plan. If implemented, the plan will bring down the Führer who, for his part, seems intent on bringing down the house with leers and popping eyeballs. Mr. Singer appears to have taken cues here from “Black Book,” Paul Verhoeven’s World War II romp, but he’s too serious to make such vaudeville work. 
Stauffenberg, who hated Hitler but worshipped the Reich, sacrificed himself on the dual altar of nationalism and militarism, which makes him a more ambiguous figure than the one drawn in “Valkyrie.” He’s a complex character, too complex for this film, which like many stories of this type, transforms World War II into a boy’s adventure with dashing heroes, miles of black leather and crane shots of German troops in lockstep formation that would make Leni Riefenstahl flutter. It’s a war that offers moral absolutes (Nazis are evil) and narratives (Nazis are evil and should die) that seem easier to grasp than any current conflict. Truly, World War II has become the moviemaker’s gift that keeps on giving, whether you want it to or not. 
“Valkyrie” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Bombs, guns and executions, though little blood.

‽
‽The Spirit‽,‽Out in the blogosphere you frequently run across invocations of Godwin’s Law, which can be paraphrased as stating that sooner or later every argument will come around to a Hitler analogy. A similar axiom, applied to Hollywood, would stipulate that every movie star must eventually dress up in a German war uniform. 
This is not the review of “Valkyrie,” by the way, a film that upholds this rule with respect to the special case of Tom Cruise. I’m just trying to figure out why, somewhere in the middle of “The Spirit,” Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson arrive on screen decked out in swastikas and jackboots. Nothing in the logic of the film explains it, but then, to use the phrase “the logic of the film” when talking about “The Spirit” may be to take the “oxy” out of “oxymoronic.” 
To ask why anything happens in Frank Miller’s sludgy, hyper-stylized adaptation of a fabled comic book series by Will Eisner may be an exercise in futility. The only halfway interesting question is why the thing exists at all. The most plausible answer lies in its pedigree. Eisner, who died in 2005, is worshiped by aficionados of what he called “sequential art” for his graphic brio, literary flair and naughty wit. For his part Mr. Miller occupies a special spot in the modern geek pantheon as the author of high-gloss comics and graphic novels like “Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,” “Sin City” and “300.” 
Though he was involved in the film adaptations of “300” and “Sin City,” “The Spirit” marks Mr. Miller’s first solo effort as a director, and his bold visual style is not well served by his clumsiness as a cinematic storyteller. The movie seems to be trying to combine a knowing, winking sense of pop-culture history with an embrace of the more soulful aspects of that history, but the result is a talky, pretentious stew of film noir poses and crime-fighter clichés. 
Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johansson at least seem to enjoy themselves, which is their prerogative since they are the villains. Gabriel Macht, who plays the fedora-wearing, skirt-chasing, undead hero (a former policeman brought mysteriously back to life as a vigilante), works hard to give off an air of hard-boiled insouciance. Unfortunately whatever natural charisma he may possess is disguised by his  hat, his mask and the murky shadows of the mise-en-scène. 
What is most striking about “The Spirit” is how little pleasure it affords, in spite of its efforts to be sly, sexy, heartfelt and clever all at once. Or perhaps the movie flounders because its multiple ambitions are fundamentally at odds, like the various femmes, fatale and otherwise, who do battle for the hero’s heart. 
The 108 overstuffed, interminable minutes of “The Spirit” yield exactly two memorable moments: when one of Mr. Jackson’s genetically engineered minions (all played by Louis Lombardi) appears as a tiny, hopping foot with a head grafted on to it, supplying an odd, creepy morsel of Surrealism; and when Eva Mendes, playing a character called Sand Saref, sits on a copy machine and presses the button. She produces what may be the only true-to-life image in the movie, as well as the most interesting. 
“The Spirit” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its intense brutality is carefully edited and shaded to emphasize its fantastical nature. 
THE SPIRIT 
Opens on Thursday nationwide.  
Written and directed by Frank Miller, based on the comic book series by Will Eisner; director of photography, Bill Pope; edited by Gregory Nussbaum; music by David Newman; art director, Rosario Provenza; produced by Deborah Del Prete, Gigi Pritzker and Michael E.

WITH: Gabriel Macht (the Spirit), Eva Mendes (Sand Saref), Sarah Paulson (Ellen), Dan Lauria (Dolan), Paz Vega (Plaster of Paris), Eric Balfour (Mahmoud), Jaime King (Lorelei), Scarlett Johansson (Silken Floss),  Samuel L. Jackson (the Octopus) and Louis Lombardi (Phobos). 
‽
‽Bedtime Stories‽,‽Adam Sandler is at that difficult age. Now 42, he’s too old to continue with the bungling, man-child shtick of yore, yet too young to transition to old-fogey infantilism. In “Bedtime Stories” the pain of this artistic limbo is written all over his character, a resentful hotel handyman named Skeeter. Astonishingly, his name is not the source of his umbrage. 
Skeeter’s pique (though he may not know it) is reserved for his dead father, an inept businessman whose cozy motel once occupied the lot where Skeeter’s current employer has erected an upscale resort. Gone, along with the homespun vibe, is Skeeter’s dream of one day running the property; so when his divorced sister, Wendy (a frighteningly taut Courteney Cox), asks him to baby-sit for his young niece and nephew (Laura Ann Kesling and Jonathan Morgan Heit) for a few days, Skeeter is in no mood to play scallywag uncle. 
“I don’t believe in happy endings,” he tells his incredulous charges when story time comes around. Luckily for the tykes, their director, Adam Shankman, loves them, the happier the better. (Even as a guest judge on “So You Think You Can Dance” Mr. Shankman, a popular choreographer, squirmed mightily to avoid delivering a bad critique.) 
Rolling up his sleeves and piling on the digital effects, he labors to whip life into a screenplay (by Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy) so tired even Bugsy, the children’s pop-eyed guinea pig, is moved to tuck himself into bed. 
But Mr. Shankman is not one to give up without a fight. And as the children concoct their own stories, Skeeter and the rest of the cast are dragged through a variety of threadbare fantasies — an Old West showdown, a medieval joust, a chariot race in ancient Greece — in which Skeeter inevitably bests the villain and bags the girl. The adorable Keri Russell, as the unfortunate target of Skeeter’s passive-aggressive affections, is the movie’s soft center and sole pleasure: a locus of calm in a sea of turmoil. 
Faring less well are performers whose tenure in children’s entertainment will, I hope, be brief, including Lucy Lawless as a brittle desk clerk and Russell Brand as Skeeter’s fuzzily written best friend. And if there were an Oscar for miscasting, Guy Pearce’s atrocious turn as the hotel’s pompous manager would be a lock. Mugging beneath a horrendous coif, he makes Basil Fawlty look like a paragon of restraint. 
Almost everyone leaves blood on the floor, but “Bedtime Stories” refuses to be juiced; soured by its enervated star and uninspired writing, the movie offers only tiny moments of joy, like a hailstorm of gumballs that’s unexpectedly magical. 
Clearly, pushing Skeeter’s broom doesn’t agree with Mr. Sandler, who seems impatient with immaturity and anxious to grow up. He was much happier selling novelty toilet plungers in “Punch-Drunk Love,” but the director of that movie, Paul Thomas Anderson, recognized his star’s natural inner rage and how to tap into it, encouraging a revelatory performance unlike anything on his résumé. 
If Mr. Sandler hopes to shift smoothly into more mature roles (as indicated by last year’s “Reign Over Me”), he needs directors who understand his uncommon gifts. The toilet plungers are optional. 
“Bedtime Stories” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). Stampeding horses, angry dwarves and a Booger Monster.  
BEDTIME STORIES 
Opens on Thursday nationwide.  
Directed by Adam Shankman; written by Matt Lopez and Tim Herlihy, based on a story by Mr. Lopez; director of photography, Michael Barrett; edited by Tom Costain and Michael Tronick; music by Rupert Gregson-Williams; production designer, Linda Descenna; produced by Andrew Gunn, Adam Sandler and Jack Giarraputo; released by Walt Disney Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes. 
WITH: Adam Sandler (Skeeter Bronson), Keri Russell (Jill), Guy Pearce (Kendall), Russell Brand (Mickey), Richard Griffiths (Barry Nottingham), Jonathan Pryce (Marty Bronson), Courteney Cox (Wendy), Lucy Lawless (Aspen), Laura Ann Kesling (Bobbi), Jonathan Morgan Heit (Patrick), Teresa Palmer (Violet Nottingham) and Aisha Tyler (Donna Hynde). 
‽
‽Yes Man‽,‽At the beginning of “Yes Man,” Carl Allen is a grouch, a curmudgeon, a wet blanket.  His relentless negativity — his job as a loan officer provides him with plenty of opportunities to say no  — is less a matter of temperament than of circumstance: apparently Carl never recovered from the breakup of his marriage. But then a visit to a self-help seminar led by a guru (Terence Stamp) who preaches the power of yes transforms Carl into a wild, unpredictable fellow, a giddy, spontaneous goofball, a gangling, motormouthed, rubber-faced id. In short, Carl turns into Jim Carrey. 
But “Yes Man,” dutifully directed by Peyton Reed (“Bring  It On,” “Down With Love”) is too sluggish and slapdash a vehicle for its star’s prodigious wackiness. The movie’s premise is not far from that of “Liar Liar,” one of Mr. Carrey’s biggest hits of the mid-’90s, in which he played a chronic dissembler suddenly compelled to tell the truth. That film was a philosophical tour de force compared  with  this one, which arrives at the startling conclusion that while saying no to everything is bad, saying yes to everything is not ideal either. 
Most of us learned at least a rudimentary version of this lesson around the age of  5, and one of the many problems with “Yes Man” is that it is insufficiently infantile. Mr. Carrey looks too grown up, too tired to plunge into the reckless silliness that the story demands, and the story doesn’t really demand enough of it. Once Carl has banished no from his vocabulary, what does he say yes to? Flying lessons. A class in conversational Korean. Every loan application that crosses his desk. 
That last bit has a somewhat unpleasant, if inadvertent, topical resonance, but never mind that. Some of the things Carl does are a bit wilder than learning to play the guitar. He accepts a sexual proposition from an elderly neighbor, which leads to a gag that was already tired when it popped up in “Soul Men” a few months ago. He wraps his head in cellophane tape. He goes on a Red Bull binge. He provokes a fight in a bar after snorting some Tabasco sauce. 
And he falls in love with a pale-eyed, mildly eccentric cutie named Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel, who took on similar waif duties opposite Will Ferrell in “Elf.” The role of Mr. Carrey’s romantic counterpart is never an easy one, given his manic energy and the childish narcissism that is the basis of his shtick. Only Kate Winslet, engaging with a more subdued incarnation of Mr. Carrey in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” has been able to distract him from himself. Ms. Deschanel never really has a chance, and instead functions as a kind of sidekick, breezing through some semi-funny set pieces on the way to an obligatory smiley-teary ending. 
Mr. Carrey has some good moments, as do a few of the supporting performers, notably Bradley Cooper as Carl’s best friend and Rhys Darby as his socially maladroit boss. But “Yes Man” rarely rises to genuine hilarity. It takes no risks, finds no inspiration and settles, like its hero, into a dull, noncommittal middle ground. Should you see this movie? Maybe. Whatever. I don’t care. 
“Yes Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing, sexual references and brief nudity. 
‽
‽The Tale of Despereaux‽,‽Once upon a time there was a charming tale of a wee little mouse with wide-open eyes and ears as large as saucers. Named Despereaux Tilling, the mouse grew up, though not by much, to become a reader of books and the besotted friend of a lovely human princess named Pea. In time he saved the day, battling an army of rats, and won the hearts of millions of readers and eventually a contract with a Hollywood studio. This is how the book “The Tale of Despereaux: Being  the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup, and a Spool of Thread” became a computer-animated movie, though without the rambling subtitle and as many eccentricities. 
Being  a Hollywood story of a mouse, a princess, some soup and thread — not to mention rats, hats and a girl named Mig  with the unfortunate looks of a pig — the movie “The Tale of Despereaux” offers up other changes too. It begins as all fairy tales should, with a narrator (an efficient, somewhat cool-sounding Sigourney Weaver) recounting the story of the pastel-hued Kingdom of Dor, where the peasants were content, the rulers were just,  and the rats scuttled about unmolested. The balm for this peaceable kingdom was soup, a fragrant broth that flowed out of the royal kitchen and into the waiting bowls of the populace. But good times turned to bad when a rat named Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) fell into the queen’s soup, producing a fatal reaction. 
Directed by Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen and written by Gary Ross (who also served as one of the producers), “Despereaux” is a pleasantly immersive, beautifully animated, occasionally sleepy tale. Like most American animated movies, it centers on a plucky hero (softly voiced by Matthew Broderick) who, against the nominal odds (though, really, the odds are always stacked in his favor), overcomes adversity of some kind. 
As in Kate DiCamillo’s enchanting, Newbery Medal-winning book, Despereaux has to triumph over both his home life (he’s far too bold for the other mice) and the forces of darkness shrouding Dor. What’s particularly sweet about his journey is that it begins with a book he was supposed to nibble, not read. 
Reading transforms Despereaux, turning a bold little mouse into a great big hero —  a wonderful moral for any children’s book. The story he reads is a fairy tale about a sad princess and a brave knight, an adventure that periodically springs to expressive life because Despereaux doesn’t merely read this tale, he visualizes it so we see it too. 
Animated in a more graphically bold style than the rest of the movie, the fairy tale becomes a story within a story. And in one clever scene, which finds the mouse describing the exploits of the knight and the princess to a separate character, the fairy tale plays on the wall next to him as if it were being projected like a movie. 
It doesn’t take long for Despereaux to experience the dangerous lows and exultant highs of a knight’s quest. Like many other misunderstood heroes, he suffers for his specialness, which in this case finds him banished from Mouseworld, an orderly Lilliput, to Ratworld, a menacing purgatory filled with bones and introduced with a flourish of Middle Eastern flute  music. (The casbah vibe thankfully fades fast.) 
There he meets Roscuro, and together they embark on the road to redemption,  with justice and a happily ever after for all, including the princess (Emma Watson) and Mig (Tracey Ullman), a peasant whose porcine qualities suggest that ugliness is destiny. But “The Tale of Despereaux” is on the side of kindness, not cruelty, and it encourages smiles if not the book’s flights of fancy. 
The movie has a fine sense of pictorial detail — the mouse’s delicate whiskers, the images of soup ladles carved into the palace stairs — and an agreeable gentleness. It deviates from its source material in generally modest and unobtrusive ways; for instance, by reorganizing the book’s fragmented, parallel story lines into a linear whole. 
The main difference between the source and its adaptation is that while the book exudes charm, the movie leans toward cute, a substitution that largely speaks to the influence of Disney on animation. In the movie Despereaux wears a red cap that makes him look more like a well-dressed bunny than like a mouse. But at least he’s not wearing Mickey’s gold clodhoppers and bottom-line grin. 
“The Tale of Despereaux” is rated G (General audiences). Some children and city-raised adults might find all the hungry, scurrying rats a bit (or very) creepy.

‽
‽Seven Pounds‽,‽“Seven Pounds,” which reunites Will Smith with Gabriele Muccino (who directed him in “The Pursuit of Happyness”), begins with a series of riddling, chronologically scrambled scenes. A man calls 911 to report his own suicide. He badgers a blind call-center employee — whom we suspect will be a significant character, since he’s played by Woody Harrelson — with complaints and insults. He embraces a lovely woman in an even lovelier beach house. He visits a nursing home where he terrorizes an administrator and comforts a resident. 
For a while it is pleasant enough to contemplate these loose ends, and to tease from them the possible contours of a story. It is never unpleasant to watch Mr. Smith, who likes to play peekaboo with his charm, hiding it now and then behind fleeting shadows of anguish or malice. The music (Angelo Milli’s score and a handful of emotive pop songs) combines with the deep colors of Philippe Le Sourd’s cinematography to summon up intensities of sentiment not yet arrived at by the narrative, creating an interesting frisson of suspense. After a while, though, as the pieces of the puzzle snap together, curiosity gives way to incredulity. 
Near the end of “Seven Pounds” a carefully laminated piece of paper appears, on which someone has written, “DO NOT TOUCH THE JELLYFISH.”  I wouldn’t dream of it, and I’ll take the message as a warning not to divulge the astonishing things that happen, not all of them involving aquatic creatures. 
Frankly, though, I don’t see how any review could really spoil what may be among the most transcendently, eye-poppingly, call-your-friend-ranting-in-the-middle-of-the-night-just-to-go-over-it-one-more-time crazily awful motion pictures ever made. I would tell you to go out and see it for yourself, but you might take that as a recommendation rather than a plea for corroboration. Did I really see what I thought I saw? 
And I wish I could spell out just what that was, but you wouldn’t believe me, and the people at Sony might not invite me to any more screenings. So instead of spelling out what happens in “Seven Pounds,” I’ll just pluck a few key words and phrases from my notes, and arrange them in the kind of artful disorder Mr. Muccino seems to favor (feel free to start crying any time): 
Eggplant parmesan. Printing press. Lung. Bone marrow. Eye transplant. Rosario Dawson. Great Dane. Banana peel. Jellyfish (but you knew that already). Car accident. Congestive heart failure. 
Huh? What the ... ? Hang on. What’s he doing? Why? Who does he think he is? Jesus! That last, by the way, is not an exclamation of shock but rather an answer to the preceding question, posed with reference to Mr. Smith. Lately he has taken so eagerly to roles predicated on heroism and world-saving self-sacrifice — see “I Am Legend” and “Hancock” — that you may wonder if he has a messiah clause in his contract. Which is not to say that he doesn’t show range in these films, in which he credibly plays a research scientist, a dissolute superhero and, in this latest one, an I.R.S. agent. 
An I.R.S. agent who wants only to help people. This is a nice, small joke that provides a few grace notes of levity in what is otherwise a lugubrious exercise in spiritual bushwa.  For all its pious, earnest air, “Seven Pounds” cries out to be remade as an Asian horror movie, so that the deep, creepy grotesqueness of its governing premise might be allowed to flourish, rather than to fester beneath the surface. 
As it is, the movie is basically an inverted, twisted tale of revenge. Ben Thomas, Mr. Smith’s character, is in essence a benevolent vigilante, harassing, stalking and spying on unsuspecting citizens for their own good, and also to punish himself. Why such misery should also be inflicted on an innocent, affirmation-hungry audience — and also on the marvelous Ms. Dawson, who plays one of Ben’s victim-beneficiaries — is another matter entirely. 
But maybe I’m approaching this in the wrong way. Maybe “Seven Pounds” isn’t a spiritual parable about redemption or forgiveness or salvation or whatever, but rather a collection of practical lessons. Don’t drive while using a BlackBerry. Fertilize your rose bushes with banana peels — sorry, that was a spoiler. But please, whatever you do, don’t touch the jellyfish. 
I’m serious. Don’t. 
“Seven Pounds” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Swearing. Soulful sex by candlelight. Car  accident. Eggplant parmesan.

‽Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi‽,‽In the last few years Hindi films have become slicker and faster, full of dizzying camera moves and blink-and-you’ll-miss-it editing. The technical exuberance is almost always impressive, but it’s starting to seem like its own cliché. 
How refreshing, then, to settle into “Rab Ne Bana di Jodi” (“A Match Made by God”), a love story   that has a different pace and feel than the recent crop of action thrillers. “Rab,” which reteams the director Aditya Chopra and Shahrukh Khan, Bollywood’s reigning superstar, is “soft, sweet and slow,” in the words of one of its songs. It deftly blends comedy,  the ruling tone of the new Bollywood, with melodrama, the ruling tone of the old. 
Mr. Khan sports glasses and a cheesy little mustache as Surinder Sahni, a shy self-described geek who works for Punjab Power in Amritsar. Surinder is gaga for his wife, Taani (the newcomer Anushka Sharma), who, because of various tragedies in the film’s first few minutes, may have lost the ability to love or be happy. 
To win Taani’s heart — or just to see her smile — Surinder gets an extreme makeover and disguises himself as Raj, a swaggering goofball who favors tight jeans and T-shirts with slogans like “Bad Boy.” Raj becomes Taani’s partner in a dance competition (“First time in Amritsar!”), and boy meets girl all over again. 
Mr. Chopra’s 1995 film, “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” starring Mr. Khan, remains a touchstone of contemporary  Bollywood, and the two do excellent work again here.   The Surinder/Raj dual role seems tailor-made (probably was) for Mr. Khan, who gets to show off his twin talents: he suffers nobly and entertains with panache. And Mr. Chopra demonstrates how a director can master technology without being mastered by it. For him, storytelling comes first. (The plot has its flaws, but they’re not deadly.) 
“Rab” is suffused with God talk and movie talk; religion and films are how the characters learn lessons about life and love. The best and most joyous sequence here is a song-and-dance number that pays witty tribute to Bollywood and Hollywood styles through the decades. It’s a lesson that goes down easy.

‽The Day the Earth Stood Still‽,‽Long after we are gone, science fiction movies about our impending extinction will instruct whoever comes next that we were a strange, neurotic species indeed. We could not — cannot — get enough of fantasies of destruction, meant at once to inflame and soothe our fear of vanishing altogether, whether through war, ecological catastrophe, disease or alien invasion. 
We know we have it coming, and a movie like “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” either in its 1951 version or in the “reimagining” that opens Friday, invites us to feel fleetingly bad about that even as we are encouraged to laugh it off. The laughter — at the earnest reckoning occasioned by a weary-looking extraterrestrial and his giant robot; at the panic and distress their visit provokes — serves as a necessary balm. Like other overwhelming emotions, the fear of apocalypse becomes more palatable when it is turned into camp. 
The old “Day,” made early in the atomic age, has long inspired this kind of laughter. It has also, in part because of its expressive, shadowy black-and-white cinematography, retained a measure of haunting, unsettling weirdness. 
Any hope that the new “Day,” directed by Scott Derrickson from a script by David Scarpa, might also someday rise above its pulpy, corny, somber silliness rests mainly on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves. Those shoulders are perfect for filling out a dark, narrow suit, just as Mr. Reeves’s deadpan basso and permanently perplexed features make him an ideal Klaatu, as the space visitor is called. Klaatu’s job is to assist, calmly and methodically, in the extermination of the human race, a task he tries, with evident fatigue, to explain to his hysterical, violent would-be victims. 
Only one will listen:  Dr. Helen Benson, played with a bit too much ennui by Jennifer Connelly. Helen, an expert in astrobiology, is part of a team of scientists taken into government custody by force when a giant orb seems about to crash into the Earth. Instead it lands in Central Park, disgorging that giant metal Cyclops robot (a near replica of the one from the earlier movie) and poor Klaatu. 
The secretary of defense (Kathy Bates, with Hillary Clinton’s demeanor and Sarah Palin’s hair) responds with military force, which only speeds the process of humanity’s annihilation and demonstrates that our executioners may have a point. We’re such a brutal, dumb, incorrigible life form that the only way the planet can survive is if we’re no longer on it. (In 1951 the case against us was mainly pacifist. Now the anti-militarism has a more urgent and explicit ecological dimension.) A metastasizing swarm of metal bugs — the best special effects in a movie that often looks cheap and bedraggled — is dispatched to eat us and everything we’ve made, or at least everything on the New Jersey Turnpike. 
But wait, Helen pleads. We can change! To provide evidence of this transformative potential she takes Klaatu to see her mentor,  Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese), a scientist who listens to Bach and was awarded a Nobel Prize for “altruistic biology.” Apparently this is the Swedish Academy’s euphemism for pimping: the good doctor’s advice to Helen about how to approach Klaatu is to “persuade him not with your reason, but with yourself.” 
Still, any movie that awards a former Monty Python cast member a Nobel Prize in anything cannot be all bad. And “The Day the Earth Stood Still” could be worse. Its scenario and many of its scenes feel ripped off rather than freshly imagined — why do aliens always seem to end up in New Jersey? — and the relationship between Helen and her stepson, Jacob (Jaden Smith), does not quite add the necessary element of heart-tugging sentiment. 
After “Wall-E” and “I  Am Legend” and the dozens of apocalypse flicks since the last “Day the Earth Stood Still” we can surely do better. Even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, much as he did back when we knew him as Neo. 
“The Day the Earth Stood Still” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). We’re doomed!

‽Nothing Like the Holidays‽,‽The gnarly dead tree in front of the Rodriguez house in Humboldt Park, a working-class Latino neighborhood of Chicago, will not be processed into kindling. As the Rodriguez menfolk, gathered for Christmas, attack it with chain saws, their incompetence with power tools makes them look like fools. Even when they try to drag it out of the earth with ropes and chains attached to a car, it refuses to budge. 
That old dead tree is an unwieldy metaphor for family solidarity in “Nothing Like the Holidays,” an efficient home-for-Christmas ensemble comedy trimmed with plastic teardrops. But the tree might also stand for a wooden holiday genre in which uplift follows tumult as surely as Christmas morning follows Christmas Eve. The only distinguishing characteristic of this mildly agreeable variation of a worn-out formula is that the boisterous family under examination is Puerto Rican, and the screenplay includes a smattering of Spanish. 
In its early scenes the movie, which has as many underdeveloped subplots as characters, threatens to be another melodrama about a returning soldier.  The glum Jesse (Freddy  Rodriguez), home from Iraq, is picked up at the airport by his neighborhood pals; sunglasses cover deep scratches around one eye that suggest he has had a set-to with a riled-up house cat. 
But “Nothing Like the Holidays,” directed by Alfredo de Villa (“Washington Heights”) from a screenplay by Alison Swan and Rick Najera, has neither the time nor the inclination to explore Jesse’s malaise in any depth. Although he harbors guilt about the death of a friend in combat, what really bugs him is that Marissa (Melonie Diaz), the girlfriend he dumped, has happily settled down with another man. 
No sooner has the Rodriguez clan gathered around the dinner table than the mother, Anna (Elizabeth Peña, who is at least a decade too young for her role), announces she is divorcing Eddy (Alfred Molina), her husband of 36 years, who owns a bodega; he allegedly cheated. The notion that a family-loving matriarch would make such a surprise announcement (even Eddy is ambushed) at a festive holiday reunion is simply bizarre. 
Dinner, of course, is ruined. The taciturn Eddy, who urges a reluctant Jesse, the younger of his two sons, to go into the family business, has his own secret torment. (Hint: It’s medical.) 
Anna, as written, is a disagreeable piece of work.  She badgers her non-Hispanic daughter-in-law, Sarah (Debra Messing), a yuppie banker, to give her a grandchild and mutters nasty things about her in Spanish, which Sarah can’t understand. The movie appears to take Anna’s side. Sarah is married to Anna’s oldest son, Mauricio (an unconvincing John Leguizamo in expensive eyewear), a successful lawyer. 
Also on hand is a daughter, Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito), a struggling television actress living in Hollywood who is waiting for a call from her agent about a part. Will Roxanna hook up with her hunky but shady childhood friend Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who carries a gun along with a potentially lethal grudge against a neighbor? Ms. Ferlito and Mr. Hernandez lend the movie a smidgen of heat. 
The most engaging moments of “Nothing Like the Holidays” are the festive party sequences in which the characters throw off their troubles to dance in the bodega and pour into the street in their Christmas finery. Their troubles momentarily forgotten, the residents of Humboldt Park really know how to enjoy themselves. 
 “Nothing Like the Holidays” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a little violence and sexual situations.

‽
‽Doubt‽,‽The air is thick with paranoia in “Doubt,” but nowhere as thick, juicy, sustained or sustaining as Meryl Streep’s performance as a distrustful nun in John Patrick Shanley’s screen adaptation of his stage play. Wearing flowing black robes, a  bonnet  that squats on her head like an upside-down Easter basket and the kind of  spectacles Mr. Pickwick probably wore to read his papers, Ms. Streep blows in like a storm, shaking up the story’s reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy. The performance may make no sense in the context of the rest of the film, but it is — forgive me, Father — gratifying nunsense. 
Although the play, which pivots on accusations of child molestation, was first staged  in 2004 —  two years after the Roman Catholic Church  sex-abuse scandals erupted in America —  it unfolds at a  historical remove in 1964. Sister Aloysius (Ms. Streep), the principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx, comes to suspect that her supervisor, Father Flynn (a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest or worse in one of their charges, Donald (Joseph Foster II), the school’s first and only black student. Shored up by the tentative suspicions of a younger nun, Sister James (an unsteady Amy Adams), Sister Aloysius begins circling Father Flynn, going in for the kill. Sister James has doubts. Sister Aloysius has, well, none. 
As its title announces, “Doubt” isn’t about certainty, but ambiguity, that no man’s land between right and wrong, black and white. This gray zone paradoxically can be  easier to grapple with on the stage, where ideas sometimes range more freely because they are not tethered to representations of the real world. Mainstream moviemaking, with its commercial directives and slavish attachment to narrative codes, by contrast, isn’t particularly hospitable to ambiguity. It insists on clear parameters, tidy endings, easy answers and a world divided into heroes and villains, which may help explain why Mr. Shanley’s film feels caught between two mediums and why Ms. Streep appears to be in a Gothic horror thriller while everyone else looks and sounds closer to life or at least dramatic realism. 
Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, “Doubt” essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach. So does Father Flynn, a character who for a long stretch appears above reproach: a good, caring, forward-thinking man whose only crime seems to be tolerance. When he suggests that the school add a secular song to its Christmas lineup as a way of reaching out to the community, Sister Aloysius reacts as if he had suggested  human sacrifice instead. That he seems to embody the spirit of reform handed down by Second Vatican Council, which ended in 1965,  makes him all the more sympathetic. 
Directing from his own script, Mr. Shanley chips away at this sympathy, pulling the story and your feelings this way and that. One of the most eccentric moments in the film occurs when Father Flynn, after admonishing some male students about their dirty fingernails, shows off his long, carefully manicured nails. Mr. Shanley complicates this feeling of gender ambiguity   later when Father Flynn, having gone to Sister Aloysius’s office for a meeting, sits behind her desk without asking permission, an assertion of power that opens a fissure in his easygoing facade and says more about the church and gender than any of their increasingly heated exchanges. Mostly, though, the characters talk, and Mr. Shanley throws a frame around  their heads. 
Words make the world go ’round  here through repetitions, indirection, allusion as well as a cunning deployment of the barely said and the flat-out unspeakable. (The word “pedophilia” is never uttered.) When Sister James tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn has “taken an interest” in Donald, the words reverberate like a struck bell. Later, when Donald’s mother (Viola Davis, shaking the film up with a few extravagantly mucousy minutes) explains to Sister Aloysius why she wants to keep her son at school, no matter what the truth about the priest, her words resonate partly because they remain veiled by shame, propriety, fear, inequality, pain. What are you telling me? Sister Aloysius demands of the stunned mother, though it’s clear they both know the answer. 
Mr. Shanley has nothing deep to say about the church and its sex scandals, and he’s still largely using words and more words, despite the tilted camera angles and pretty pictures. But the words are good, solid, at times touching. His work with the actors is generally fine, though it’s a mystery what he thought Ms. Streep, with her wild eyes and an accent as wide as the  Grand Concourse, was doing. Her outsize performance has a whiff of burlesque, but she’s really just operating in a different register from the other actors, who are working in the more naturalistic vein of modern movie realism. She’s a hoot, but she’s also a relief, because, for some of us, worshiping Our Lady of Accents is easier on the soul than doing time in church. 
“Doubt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Intimations of child sexual abuse.

‽
‽Delgo‽,‽In the fictional land of Jhamora, the earthbound Lockni natives have come to distrust the winged Nohrin immigrants (a shared fondness for the silent “h” notwithstanding). So when a Lockni lad named Delgo (voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr.) develops a crush on the Nohrin princess Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt), her resemblance to Paula Abdul and his to a mottled potato are the least of their problems. 
Plundering the imaginations of Anne McCaffrey, Peter Jackson, George Lucas and Shakespeare, this barely animated fantasy suffers from more than just a lack of originality. Dreary battles and apathetic voice work — only Eric Idle, as a malaprop-prone servant, earns his fee — conspire in a sedition-oriented plot that not even six writers (including the directors, Marc F. Adler and Jason F. Maurer) are able to invigorate. 
Too leaden for adults and too baffling for kids (a gambling soldier whines about “the vig”), “Delgo” has a lumbering, prehistoric vibe fueled by dinosaur-derived creatures and images of intimidating density. Louis Gossett Jr.’s dignified baritone, emanating from the Nohrin king — whose bone structure recalls the alien played by Mr. Gossett in “Enemy Mine” — is no match for Chris Kattan’s grating contribution as Delgo’s shrieking sidekick, Filo. If only the evil empress Sedessa had crushed him beneath her heel instead of that innocent Lockni baby. 
“Delgo” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A wicked aunt, an endless war and unnecessarily tight unitards.

‽
‽Adam Resurrected‽,‽With his dark whirlpool eyes and sensual clown’s mouth, Jeff Goldblum has always suggested an actor poised to reveal a thousand faces, many of them nightmarish apparitions. In “The Fly” we saw a few of them; more emerge in the Holocaust survivor drama “Adam Resurrected.” The movie’s unsettling opening image is a close-up of his character, Adam Stein, in clown makeup, rolling his left eye while keeping the right stationary. 
In no particular order Mr. Goldblum’s shape-shifting character is an imperious circus magician and knife thrower, a dog whisperer, a wily seducer, a raging drunk and a traumatized observer of genocide. Mr. Goldblum’s tour-de-force performance, alas, is not enough to transmit a steady emotional current through the movie, directed by Paul Schrader from Noah Stollman’s adaptation of a 1968 novel by an Israeli, Yoram Kaniuk. 
A charismatic Jewish circus performer in 1930s Berlin, Adam survives the Holocaust by exploiting his skills as an entertainer. As the film goes on to explore his extreme case of survivor’s guilt after the war, it poses familiar questions about who is sane  in an insane world and assumes that simply reiterating those questions will suffice. The film is so flat that it leaves you wondering if Mr. Kaniuk’s book is ultimately untranslatable to the screen. 
The novel, which won extravagant critical acclaim and earned comparisons to “Catch-22” and the magical realism of Gabriel  García Márquez, takes the concept of being treated like a dog to its absurdist limits. After Adam is scooped up by the Nazis, he is forced to accept a Faustian arrangement: he lives in comfort at a concentration camp as the pet dog of Commandant Klein (Willem Dafoe), a Nazi officer who remembers  Adam’s nightclub animal act. 
This human dog is expected to amuse his owner by doing what David Letterman might call stupid  human tricks,  which distract Klein from the gruesome business at hand. Spending days on all fours, begging, rolling over and seizing hunks of meat with his teeth from the mouth of the commandant’s German shepherd  — with which he forms an animal bond —  Adam is a “good dog.” When not a pet, Adam is forced to play the violin and serenade his fellow prisoners, including his wife and daughter, as they are marched to the gas chambers. The scene in which they pass him on the way to the crematorium is one of the  potentially wrenching moments that the film throws away. 
The movie leaps around in time, from the 1930s and ’40s (in black-and-white sequences) to the 1950s and early  ’60s (color), when Adam is the star patient at a psychiatric treatment center for Holocaust survivors in the Negev desert. In these madhouse scenes Adam, much like McMurphy in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” has the run of the place. He swills booze out of the bottle and carries on an affair with the head nurse (Ayelet Zurer), who is so besotted with him that she eagerly grovels on all fours and barks for attention. 
The dog phobia Adam has had since his concentration camp days begins to dissolve and then to change into fatherly concern with his discovery of David (Tudor  Rapiteanu), a wild child sequestered in the hospital. Chained to his bed, clutching a sheet with eyeholes through which he peers like a Halloween ghost, David believes he is a dog. As Adam and David develop a bond, the boy takes his first lurching steps on two feet and begins to make human sounds. He becomes the vehicle for Adam’s “resurrection” to sanity. 
I can understand why Mr. Schrader and Mr. Stollman would resist milking these scenes for tear-jerking empathy, since the fable’s sardonic final twist is its suggestion that sanity, whatever that may be, robs existence of its divine fire. 
Savage gallows humor might have substituted for pathos. But “Adam Resurrected” feels so detached that there is not a laugh, nor even a wicked smirk of nihilistic glee, to be gleaned. 
 “Adam Resurrected” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of physical and emotional cruelty and sexual situations.

‽
‽Cadillac Records‽,‽In “Cadillac Records,” Darnell Martin’s rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues in its hectic golden age, Jeffrey Wright plays the singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. This feat is made even more impressive and interesting when you reflect that in the same movie season Mr. Wright has portrayed another notable real-life African-American, the former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in Oliver Stone’s “W.” The man is equally credible as a statesman and a bluesman. If that’s not range, what is? 
Much more than racial typecasting or clever mimicry is at work in these performances. Mr. Wright can hardly be said to bear a strong physical resemblance to Muddy Waters or Mr. Powell — or, for that matter, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom he played in the HBO film “Boycott,” or to the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, so brilliantly impersonated in “Basquiat.” 
Rather, Mr. Wright, as protean and serious an actor as any working in American movies, seems to be writing his own version of “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man,” the literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s collection of essays on various styles of African-American manhood. 
In each case, whether playing a former soldier or a tormented artist, Mr. Wright directs our attention away from the familiar, public face of the character in question toward a private zone where ambition struggles with anxiety, and where what seems to be at stake is nothing less than the integrity and viability of the self. And so, in his Muddy Waters, we see pride, ambition and uncertainty cohabiting with musical genius, sexual appetite and stubborn professionalism. 
“Cadillac Records” is by no means Mr. Wright’s film alone, and his work is enriched by the skill and verve of a prodigious ensemble. The film is not — thank goodness — another dutiful musical biopic, but rather the group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists, including Little Walter (Columbus Short), Chuck Berry (Mos Def), Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles), Howlin’ Wolf (Eamonn  Walker) and Willie Dixon, the bassist and songwriter who narrates in the mellow, countrified voice of Cedric the Entertainer. 
These musical innovators are gathered together — promoted, exploited and given shiny new Caddies with heavy strings attached — by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody), a Jewish entrepreneur in postwar Chicago who sees “race music” as a potential gold mine. That it also turns out to be an agent of wholesale cultural transformation — an old song observes that the blues had a baby, and they called it rock ’n’ roll — does not faze him in the least. 
Few subjects are as encrusted with legend, hyperbole and sheer bunk as the history of American popular music, and there will no doubt be pedants who will object to some of the liberties “Cadillac Records” has taken with the literal truth. At times Leonard Chess seems so stressed out by running the record company bearing his name that you wish he had, say, a brother to share the burden. The real Leonard Chess did, but for now Phil Chess will have to join Nesuhi Ertegun, brother of Ahmet, in the ranks of music industry siblings neglected by Hollywood. 
In any case, Ms. Martin, who wrote as well as directed “Cadillac Records,” does not need to lean too heavily on the historical record, or on the dreary conventions of pop-culture hagiography,  because she has a clear and complicated set of ideas about her characters and a deep appreciation of the music they made. It is, sadly, all too rare for a movie about important musicians to pay intelligent attention to the sounds and idioms that make their lives worth dramatizing in the first place. 
But in “Cadillac Records” you hear most of the important advances and developments that defined urban blues in the 1940s and ’50s. When Muddy Waters, newly arrived in Chicago from Mississippi, plugs his guitar into an amplifier, a new sonic mutation occurs. Then Chuck Berry comes along, playing in a speedier, country-inflected style that makes him the first major star to cross from the R&amp;B to the pop charts. 
“Cadillac Records” would be worth seeing for the music alone. Mr. Wright’s renditions of Muddy Waters’s signature songs are more than respectable, while Ms. Knowles’s interpretations of Ms. James’s hits — “At Last” and “I’d Rather Go Blind,” in particular — are downright revelatory. 
And so, it should be said, is Ms. Knowles’s performance. In her previous film roles she has seemed guarded and tentative, as if worried that her charisma would melt from too much emotional heat. Here, playing a needy, angry, ferociously talented and fantastically undisciplined woman, she is as volcanic and voluptuous as an Italian movie star. Or, more to the point, a real soul diva of the old school. 
The music is also a window into history, and “Cadillac Records” is an uncommonly astute treatment of race in America at the end of the Jim Crow era. Its dense, anecdotal narrative is built around the sometimes uneasy friendship between Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters, his first big star. Chess is devoted to his artists, but he also profits from their art, and Mr. Brody shows him to be neither a paragon of racial enlightenment nor a predator. 
“His job is to make money off you,” Howlin’ Wolf says to Muddy Waters, who is hurt by what he sees as Chess’s double-dealing. “You’re from Mississippi. I thought you would have known that.” 
The rivalry between those two bluesmen is another source of intrigue in “Cadillac Records,” which sustains a remarkable number of dramatically important relationships, any one of which could have been a movie in its own right. Muddy Waters is also a mentor to Little Walter — a troubled, reckless, brilliant harmonica player — and a steadfast (if unfaithful) husband to Geneva (Gabrielle Union). Chess, meanwhile, though he is married (his wife, Revetta, is played by Emmanuelle Chriqui) is nearly undone by his passion for Etta James. 
So much passion, so much pain, so much tenderness and violence. If you dig up an album from the heyday of Chess Records, you’ll find all that and more. And “Cadillac Records” is nearly as good as one of those albums, which is saying a lot. This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that’s just fine. Like those big, boxy Caddies (and like Howlin’ Wolf, if he did say so himself), it’s built for comfort, not for speed. It hums, it purrs and it roars. 
“Cadillac Records” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has smoking, swearing, sex and mayhem in excess, which is just the right amount.

‽Nobel Son‽,‽At some point Randall Miller, who has directed one movie about ballroom dancing and another about the wine trade — apparently decided he wanted to become a tough guy, or at least flex his genre muscles. Thus “Nobel Son,” an aggressively noisy exercise in style over substance about nasty people doing nasty things to one another in (sigh) Southern California. Like many contemporary genre flicks, the new movie features a hyperactive visual style that owes its tricks and tics, smeared images and staccato cuts to art-house exploitation like “City of God” and latter-day Tony Scott, but without the commensurate technical finesse. 
Alan Rickman plays Eli Michaelson, who shortly after the story chugs to a start has won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, a milestone that delights no one save for him. A world-class heel and adulterer, a lousy father (to Bryan Greenberg’s Barkley) and worse husband (to Mary Steenburgen’s Sarah), Eli, with his monstrous ego, would be enough for a lot of movies but turns out to be merely the warm-up act for a chaotic plot involving a violent kidnapping, a distant suicide, murky secrets and outright distortions. Mr. Greenberg, whose character is writing a dissertation about cannibalism (he appears to be pro), somehow crosses paths first with Eliza Dushku and then with Shawn Hatosy, both of whom are better than their material. 
Mr. Miller is clearly slumming in “Nobel Son” (it was shot before his recently released “Bottle Shock”), which wouldn’t be a problem if he seemed to be interested in playing with genre rather than condescending to it, as he does here. But from story to casting, “Nobel Son” feels designed for mockery, from the stunt casting (Danny DeVito as a dim-bulb neighbor, Ted Danson as a bow-tied academic) to the lazy parodies of coffeehouse poetry readings to the treatment of poor Ms. Dushku, who, as a wild-eyed poet who sleeps with the nominal hero, not only has to play the crazy woman and a hack artist but also has to brandish her thong underwear. Isn’t being young and female in Hollywood punishment enough? 
There’s a bit more, mostly a throbbing techno score and a showy, disappointing performance from the almost always welcome Mr. Rickman. (He and Bill Pullman, who has a small role in this film as the requisite rumpled cop, were the headliners in “Bottle Shock.”) As Eli, Mr. Rickman oozes from scene to scene doing a fair approximation of a lizard with a little Joan Crawford thrown in for good (or bad) measure. Although it’s amusing to watch him point his nose in the air while taking aim at the ostensibly nicer characters, all of whom are even more tedious than Eli, the performance grows thin fast. Even lizards and villains need a perch, something more solid than noise and smears from which they can do their slithering. 
“Nobel Son” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). One scene features the very bloody, nonsurgical removal of a thumb.

‽Let Them Chirp Awhile‽,‽Having heard once too often that his outfit is kind of lame, Bobby (Justin Rice), a useless East Village hipster, tucks into the American Apparel store on Houston Street and picks out a baby blue T-shirt with some help from Charlotte (Charlotte Af Geijerstam), a failed actress in hot pants and leg warmers. Later they meet for a drink and commiserate about their boring, complacent, privileged lives. 
“The old city,” Bobby muses, “like the one that I dreamed about, the one from the movies. It’s not there anymore. Maybe we’re both just maladjusted, you know, like we’re living in the past.” 
And thus, for one brief moment, does “Let Them Chirp Awhile” acknowledge the source of its painfully unsympathetic take on postcollegiate New Yorkers who think themselves artists but don’t have an original thought in their heads. 
Written and directed by Jonathan Blitstein, the movie really does live in an imaginary past, the one immortalized in classic Woody Allen films. How else to explain why Bobby and his circle of friends name-drop Chekhov, pontificate on Bergman, crack tired jokes about Los Angeles and spend all their time either failing at relationships or kvetching  about their inadequacies while whimsical jazz coos on the soundtrack? 
This sort of thing was indulgent enough the first time around; transplanted to the mumblecore milieu, it’s intolerable.

‽Punisher: War Zone‽,‽“Who punishes you?” someone asks Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson), better known as the Punisher, in the punishing new entertainment called “Punisher: War Zone.”  It’s a fair enough question, but the one I had as I sat through 107 bloody, grinding minutes was a little different: What did I ever do to deserve this? 
Dumb question, I know. It’s silly to take the brutality of “Punisher: War Zone,” which is based on a comic book with a devoted following, seriously or personally. Guys get their heads blown off, or severed, or pierced with chair legs, or pulverized with fists, because that’s what they have coming and that’s what the fan base will pay money to see. But does it have to be so witless, so stupid, so openly contemptuous of the very audience it’s supposed to be pandering to? 
More dumb questions! I understand that the picture, directed with grisly intensity by Lexi Alexander, is a big, bloody cartoon. At its center is a grim, humorless avenger whose nemesis is a onetime mobster named Jigsaw (Dominic West), so called because his face was disfigured in a recycling accident. Jigsaw has a crazy brother named Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) — but, really, why bother? You will see this movie or not, and it will make about as much sense to you either way. There is, however, one line that is, if not quite clever, at least relevant for the purposes of concluding this review. As the Punisher says to a bad guy he’s about to waste, “I guess I’ll put you out of my misery.” 
“Punisher: War Zone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing and extremely graphic killing.

‽Repo Chick‽,‽Repo Chick 
Opens on Friday  in Manhattan.  
Directed by Alex Cox 
1 hour 25 minutes; not rated 
The problems with “Repo Chick,” Alex Cox’s extreme satire for the age of foreclosure, begin with Jaclyn Jonet’s personality-free portrayal of its heroine, Pixxi De La Chasse, a mouthy Paris Hilton-like celebutante who is disinherited by her wealthy family. To earn a living, Pixxi becomes a repossessor who hunts and terrorizes “main-line mortgage abusers.” Her ultimate assignment, however, is to collect a million-dollar bounty for some antique railroad cars. All the while, she is being filmed by her punk posse for a reality show to appear on closed-circuit television in a Dubai hotel. 
Pixxi eventually finds herself imprisoned while aboard those elusive railroad cars during a fake publicity junket organized by eco-terrorists who threaten to blow up Los Angeles with missing Soviet growler bombs (stored in the caboose) from the Communist era. The city will be spared only if the president criminalizes golf and the government turns vegan. By this time, “Repo Chick” has deteriorated from a clotted comic mess into a leaden thriller spoof. 
The movie’s title is its only real connection with Mr. Cox’s 1984 cult favorite, “Repo Man,” to which it is definitely not a sequel. Shot almost entirely on a soundstage against a green screen, “Repo Chick” might be described as a toy movie. Its cast includes several alumni of earlier films by Mr. Cox, including Chloe Webb, who played Nancy Spungen in “Sid and Nancy.” 
Much of the wit, such as it is, can be found on roadside billboards that read “God loves golf,” “Eat meat,” and “A is for apathy, B is for boredom, and C is for clinical depression.” You may find yourself in the C state if you subject yourself to this comic mishap, whose satire already feels out of date. STEPHEN HOLDEN  Breaking and Entering 
Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.   
Directed by Benjamin Fingerhut 
1 hour 28 minutes; not rated 
The only significantly false note in “Breaking and Entering” is its overly clever title, which doesn’t give you much of a clue that it’s a film about people obsessed with getting their names in the Guinness Book of World Records. Otherwise, Benjamin Fingerhut’s documentary is a brisk and absorbing tour of the human ego. 
Mr. Fingerhut keeps his narration-free film (the only voices we hear belong to the record seekers and their family and friends whom they haven’t driven away) moving at such a fast pace that you may not notice how it’s been stitched together. Three stories — of a grape catcher, an endurance stationary cyclist (symbolically racing to nowhere) and a pair of marathon jogglers — are covered in some depth, but the film also drops in on a banjo picker, a concrete-block breaker, a whip cracker, a ball spinner, a finger snapper and a telephone-book-ripping couple, among many others. Apparently Mr. Fingerhut never met a record seeker he didn’t like. 
“Breaking and Entering” never mocks or questions its subjects; the more introspective of these obsessive record chasers take care of that themselves. There’s definitely no place for mockery in the case of the jogglers Michal Kapral and Zach Warren, who can each run a marathon, juggling three balls the entire route, in under three hours. When you can do that, who needs Guinness? MIKE HALE  
A Somewhat Gentle Man 
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.  
Directed by Hans Petter Moland 
 In Norwegian, with English subtitles 
 1 hour 43 minutes; not rated 
Like its glum antihero, “A Somewhat Gentle Man” takes a little time to find its feet. Until it does, you may struggle to care about Ulrik (Stellan Skarsgard), a middle-aged murderer newly released from prison. Beefy and slow-moving, quiet and ponytailed, Ulrik seems content to observe freedom rather than embrace it. His former boss (a strutting Bjorn Floberg) expects him to kill the snitch who put him away for 12 years, but Ulrik is done with violence — or so he thinks. 
A story about old men bobbing in the wake of a young man’s profession (among Ulrik’s former associates, diabetes, stroke and a colostomy have taken their toll), this Norwegian entry in the deadpan gangster comedy genre finds its mournful tone in Patsy Cline’s tunes and Mr. Skarsgard’s doleful puss. Surrounded by truculent women and ridiculous men — all of them sporting lank hair, dingy skin and homeless-shelter fashions — Ulrik accepts a job as a car mechanic and enjoys the steamed cod and sexual favors of his guillotine-faced landlady (Jorunn Kjellsby). In lieu of pillow talk, they watch the Polish version of “Dancing With the Stars.” 
Patiently directed by Hans Petter Moland, Ulrik’s journey back to life slowly draws you in. As he tentatively reaches out to his estranged son (Jan Gunnar Roise) and an emotionally fragile co-worker (Jannike Kruse), his complexion visibly warms. When, in the film’s beatific final moments, Ulrik beams for the first time, it’s what we’ve been waiting for all along. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS   
Plastic Planet 
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.  
 Directed by Werner Boote 
 In English and German, with English subtitles 
 1 hour 39 minutes; not rated 
From pantyhose to Porta Potties, plastic — the catch-all term for a wide variety of synthetic materials — has infiltrated virtually every aspect of modern life. For the Austrian filmmaker Werner Boote, it’s personal: plastic is, quite literally, in his blood. As we discover in “Plastic Planet,” it’s probably in ours, too. 
And not just because of our addiction to Tupperware. Among the film’s many fascinating and ultimately alarming claims is that, for most of its roughly 500-year life expectancy, plastic slowly releases molecules of maleficence into the food chain, many of them linked to sexual abnormalities in fish and infertility in humans. 
There’s more than enough material here for a meaty exposé, but Mr. Boote (the grandson of a plastics manufacturer, now deceased) is less focused than a kitten in a yarn store. Hugging a plastic globe from China, he zips through no fewer than 14 countries to interview plastic lovers and haters, scientists and citizens. 
An appealingly eccentric guide, Mr. Boote trots from an environmental dispute in Venice to a rubbish dump in India, and meets a Japanese sculptor  and an American plastic surgeon. Sniffing and licking as he goes, and pausing to rub his face vigorously with bioplastics, the director favors a peripatetic style that staves off boredom but is frustratingly shallow. 
Sometimes things get a little weird, as Mr. Boote questions a woman on the sensations caused by her breast implants, and later — channeling Michael Moore — visits a trade show grasping a megaphone. 
“You will get big breasts,” he warns the attendees, noting the possible hormonal disruptions caused by their products. And while these digressions lighten the film’s mood, “Plastic Planet” does little but raise an alarm, then leave it jangling. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS  
‽
‽Mugabe and the White African‽,‽Lucy Bailey and Andrew Thompson’s “Mugabe and the White African” is a documentary account of the efforts of Mike Campbell and his son-in-law, Ben Freeth, to hold onto their farm. It tracks their precedent-setting lawsuit against Robert Mugabe, the authoritarian Zimbabwean president, in a regional African court, as well as events on the ground in Zimbabwe: intimidation, threats and violence against the white farmers still holding out after a decade of  land seizures by the government. 
Many viewers will leave “Mugabe and the White African” thinking that they have seen few, if any, documentaries as wrenching, sad and infuriating, and those feelings will be justified. What has happened (and continues to happen) to the Campbells, the Freeths and some of their white neighbors is not only unjust but also a horrifying, slow-motion nightmare.  That sensation is reinforced by the movie’s political-thriller style, partly a result of the covert filming methods necessary in a country where practicing journalism can get you thrown in jail. 
It should be pointed out, though, that Ms. Bailey and Mr. Thompson achieve their results largely through the narrowness of their focus. Almost the only voices we hear are those of the farmers, their families and their lawyers. Other viewpoints are limited to a rant by the man, a government minister’s son, to whom the farm has been promised, and Mr. Mugabe’s recorded voice, including his notorious line that he doesn’t mind being seen as a Hitler by the West. 
It’s possible to honor the suffering of the Campbells and the Freeths and to revile the actions of the Mugabe government and, at the same time, to be uneasy with the emotions the film stirs and to feel that its one-sidedness and its nearly complete lack of historical and cultural context are problems. The farm’s black work force is frequently on screen and is presented as sympathetic to its employers, but the workers rarely speak. It’s impossible to know what their true, probably complex and contradictory feelings are. 
Mr. Freeth asks why being a white African should be any different than being a white American or a white Australian. It’s a good sound bite, but a moment’s reflection tells you that the comparison doesn’t hold water: the courses of colonialism and racial strife were radically different in America and Australia than they were in Africa. That doesn’t make Mr. Freeth’s cause any less just, but it does mean that “Mugabe and the White African” needs to be approached with care. 
‽
‽Living in Emergency‽,‽At one point in “Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders,” Mark Hopkins’s new documentary about that Paris-based humanitarian group, an Australian doctor stationed in Congo, his tongue loosened by a lot of local beer, unloads his scorn for Unicef and other, similar organizations. They approach mass suffering, he says, by way of theories, meetings and high-minded statements of principle, whereas he and other Doctors Without Borders physicians meet the consequences of war, epidemic and natural disaster one patient at a time. 
The organization, also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, was founded in France in 1971 and is devoted to the simple idea that its doctors should go where they are desperately needed without regard for political considerations or long-term agendas. Though the film spends a little time at the organization’s headquarters, it basically adheres to this ground-level approach, following a few volunteers in the field as they treat the sick and wounded and try to uphold modern standards of care in rough and sometimes horrifying circumstances. 
A more conventional kind of documentary might have delved deeper into the history and philosophy of the organization, one of whose founders was Bernard Kouchner, a former leftist militant who is now foreign minister in France’s right-of-center government. (A fascinating account of Mr. Kouchner’s career can be found in Paul Berman’s book “Power and the Idealists.”) And, similarly, if “Living in Emergency” had stuck more closely to the conventions of movies that seek to raise Western awareness of terrible situations elsewhere in the world, it would have explored what is going on in Liberia and Congo, where most of the film takes place. 
But that kind of contextualization would have been antithetical both to the organization’s mission and to Mr. Hopkins’s own interest, which is in the particular challenges faced by individual doctors who sign up for six-month tours in what they routinely describe as some of the worst places on earth. What we know about Liberia, for the purposes of the film, is that it recently emerged from a long, unimaginably brutal civil war of the kind that Congo is still suffering. This means that the devastation the medical volunteers find in Liberia is leavened by hope, and that the superior facilities that seem to exist in Congo are under constant threat of violence. 
Doctors in Congo treat gunshot and machete wounds, whereas their counterparts in Liberia deal with infectious diseases, malnutrition and the effects of poor sanitation. And while some of the drama in “Living in Emergency” comes from the tension of specific cases — will the boy with the head wound survive? what is causing that child’s face and belly to swell? — the film, just like any good hospital television series, is really about the curious psychology of the medical profession. It is, most affectingly, a series of portraits depicting men and women who, while they are undeniably selfless, brave and hard-working, can also be vain, jealous, self-righteous and, from time to time, drunk. 
Mr. Hopkins gravitates toward four  doctors in particular: Tom Krueger, a surgeon from Tennessee; Chris Brasher, an Australian who has given most of his career to the organization, and whose work for it fills his nomadic life with novelty, danger and meaning; Chiara Lepora, who is Italian and oversees the group’s activities in Liberia; and Davinder Gill, another Australian, who works virtually alone at a clinic in a remote, rural part of that country. Dr. Lepora likens Dr. Gill to Kurtz in Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness,” going slowly mad in the bush, but he is also furious at the lack of logistical and moral support coming from her. 
These doctors are hard on themselves and on one another, and as “Living in Emergency” chronicles their small triumphs and large frustrations, a larger picture emerges, almost despite the film’s avowedly local emphasis. Doctors Without Borders, for all its global prestige, is a small organization, and since it cannot be everywhere at once, it must often leave places like Liberia just as things are starting to improve. The extent of the need around the world is so enormous and overwhelming that the efforts of the doctors in this sobering film seem both vitally necessary and woefully inadequate.

‽
‽Mine‽,‽One from the heart, the documentary “Mine” relates yet one more wrenching, infuriating story about Hurricane Katrina and the devastation wreaked both by the storm and by human error and indifference. While many victims in the movie will look familiar — whether waving from their New Orleans rooftops after the levees broke in 2005 or talking about their ruined lives and homes afterward — the majority of the victims here have usually been seen only in the background, forlornly howling and wagging their tails. 
Directed by Geralyn Pezanoski, making a fine feature debut, “Mine” tells the story of the pets, mostly dogs and cats, left behind during the storm when their humans were forced to flee. Like much of the rest of the world, Ms. Pezanoski followed the news in horror as a natural disaster morphed into a larger catastrophe. What caught her eye, however, and clearly also her emotions, were the impromptu animal-rescue teams that sprang into action and, from across America, descended on New Orleans. She flew to the inundated city and with a small team spent six weeks following rescuers as they broke into homes, clambering through windows and crawl spaces to save masses of frightened, starving animals. 
Smartly, Ms. Pezanoski didn’t stop shooting once the waters retreated and the excitement and political controversy died down. Realizing that the rescued animals were now separated from companions who were scattered around the country and, importantly, were at first forbidden to return to New Orleans (and their pets), she kept her attention fixed and her digital video camera running. Those who tracked this story know what happened next, which doesn’t lessen its impact. By the time some New Orleans pet owners returned to the city, their animals had been shipped out of state, where they were sometimes placed in foster homes and even adopted. New Orleans residents like Malvin Cavalier, a dapper octogenarian who made a jaunty pair with his fluffy white dog, Bandit, were robbed of their homes and closest friends. 
Go ahead and get a tissue to wipe your tears. I did. “Mine” isn’t fully successful — it’s a bit ragged and, at 81 minutes, far too short for the scope of its ambitions — but it’s smart, sincere and affecting. The emotional impact deepens as Ms. Pezanoski begins to narrow her focus, interviewing residents like Mr. Cavalier, along with Jessie Pullins and Gloria Richardson, two other pet owners who were separated from their animals. Mr. Pullins named his cute mutt J. J., as in Jessie Jr., and hangs onto memories of his dog as if the animal were hope itself. Ms. Richardson is an elderly woman who was forcibly removed from her home, even after she insisted on not being separated from her Labrador, Murphy Brown. (All the separation stories are about dogs.) 
As is true of every Katrina story, race and class play significant roles in “Mine,” which grows more disturbing as the weeks melt into years. The animal rescue world can be an eccentric battlefield, a place where pets matter more than their people, and Ms. Pezanoski registers its admirable and unsettling elements fairly. When a white lawyer chides a black woman for abandoning her dog — the woman says she had her hands full rescuing her children and wheelchair-bound mother — it’s hard not to flash back to those commentators who wondered why the poor inhabitants  of New Orleans didn’t just leave in their nonexistent cars. Ms. Pezanoski can only offer a gloss on this world of pain, but she does so with compassion and admirable patience.

‽Garbage Dreams‽,‽Following on the grimy heels of “Marina of the Zabbaleen” (released here in September) comes “Garbage Dreams,” a second documentary about a poor community of trash recyclers on the outskirts of Cairo. But in the hands of the director and photographer Mai Iskander, this new film digs deeper into the politics of a life that few would choose but many depend on. 
With no official sanitation services, Cairo’s 18 million residents have for decades relied on zabbaleen (Arabic for “garbage people”) to collect their waste, which the zabbaleen do with enviable thoroughness   and an 80 percent recycling rate. Filming over four years, Ms. Iskander highlights three charismatic youths as they face competition from foreign companies with more mechanized, if significantly less green, methods. 
Expertly weaving personal fears, family tensions and political action (the zabbaleen don’t whine; they strive to modernize), “Garbage Dreams” records the tremblings of a culture at a crossroads. At no point is this more evident than when two of the young men, sponsored by a Welsh recycling group, travel to a sleek recycling plant in Wales. One moment they’re on a mound of rubbish in Cairo, picking through plastic and shards of glass, the next they’re surrounded by Welsh pastures and humming conveyor belts. 
Nabil, 18, is unimpressed. “Here there’s technology but no precision,” he snorts, appalled at the plant’s recycling rate of around 20 percent. To the zabbaleen, machines are useful, but ancient knowledge is priceless.

‽Old Partner‽,‽Animals are hardly rare on film these days, but most  are bred in digital laboratories and given voice and charisma by movie stars. The inscrutable dignity of actual beasts is less often captured and may even seem strange when encountered in a documentary like “Old Partner,” the first feature directed by Lee Chung-ryoul. 
To call an ancient, slow-moving, nameless ox the hero of the film would be a slight distortion, since the only actions he performs are the ones that have defined his daily existence for more than 30 years. He ruminates. He pulls a plow and occasionally a cart, moving with exquisite slowness as the world goes rushing by. His body is bony and massive, and his face is a perpetual enigma, expressing steadfastness, resignation or, more likely, a state of bovine consciousness beyond the ken of humans. 
Not that this ox, thought to be the oldest in South Korea, is a stranger to people. On the contrary, he is the longtime companion of an elderly farming couple, Choi Won-kyun and Lee Sam-soon. Older than most of their nine children, the ox has shared their daily round of work and rest, a utilitarian arrangement that turns out to be surprisingly complicated. In his quiet, unassuming way, the animal sits at the apex of a love triangle, serving Mr. Choi as a helpmate  and confidant and representing, to Ms. Lee, a rival for her husband’s devotion. 
Mr. Choi, frail and partially deaf, one of his legs withered by a long-ago accident, is cantankerous and impatient with his wife and tenderly solicitous of his beast of burden. He prepares special fodder, and keeps his fields pesticide-free. When, late in the film, he reluctantly agrees to sell the ox at an agricultural fair, he is shocked at  the low  offers. It is  also possible that he has set his asking price high enough to make a sale unlikely. 
Ms. Lee, meanwhile, who has no grudge against the ox (though she seems to prefer a younger heifer), peppers her husband with complaints that sound both sincere and habitual. She works hard, she’s tired and she has wasted her life on the wrong man. Mr. Choi tunes her out, but  he is quick to respond whenever the ox seems to need something. 
Still, the condition these three  share can  be described only as happiness, though it is not the kind of material comfort often associated with that word. Rather, like the French farmers in Raymond Depardon’s documentaries on rural life or the shepherds in the recent Kazakh film “Tulpan,” they represent an old and difficult way of life that seems to be fading  before our eyes. The  elderly couple’s relationship with the animal who has shared their lives may seem odd, charming and a bit absurd, but the deep and poignant insight of Mr. Lee’s film is that such complicated interspecies bonds are perfectly natural.

‽
‽Sherlock Holmes‽,‽Early in “Sherlock Holmes” — and also again, later on — the famous sleuth demonstrates his ratiocinative powers in a way undreamed of by his creator, Arthur Conan Doyle. Observing a thug standing guard over a horrible crime in a dimly lighted church, Holmes calculates just how to surprise the man, disarm him and beat him senseless. The audience follows his thought process through slow-motion pre-enactment, observing how the laws of anatomy and physics will be used to snap bones, gouge organs and turn flesh into pulp. Then, having seen it diagramed once on screen, we see it all again, with more noise, in real time. Elementary! 
Doyle’s Holmes, who arrived in Victorian pop culture in 1887 (with the publication of “A Study in Scarlet”), has adapted since then to changes in taste and entertainment technology. He was a proto-superhero, amenable to all kinds of elaboration and variation, and even a measure of mockery, as long as the basics of the brand were respected. For most of his existence he has lived at 221B Baker Street, smoking a pipe, playing the violin and sticking faithfully to bachelorhood and his belief in the functional elegance of the deerstalker hat. 
But Holmes has never been much for physical violence, and the chief innovation of this new, franchise-ready incarnation, directed by Guy Ritchie and played by Robert Downey Jr., is that he is, in addition to everything else, a brawling, head-butting, fist-in-the-gut, knee-in-the-groin action hero. 
A smart one, for sure, and as played by Mr. Downey, with his characteristic twitchy wit and haggard insouciance, he has more intelligence than the movie knows what to do with. (His Holmes has also lost the deerstalker, favoring battered porkpie- or bowlerlike headwear, perhaps in homage to Charlie Chaplin, another character Mr. Downey has played.) 
Of course intelligence has never ranked high among either Mr. Ritchie’s interests or his attributes as a filmmaker. His primary desire, most successfully realized early in his directing career, in “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and “Snatch,” has always been to be cool: to make cool movies about cool guys with cool stuff.  Yes, “Sherlock Holmes” is kind of cool. But that’s not really a compliment. 
Still, it’s Christmas, and the teenage boys in the house have fructose in their bloodstreams and time on their hands, so let’s call it half a compliment. There are worse things than loutish, laddish cool, and as a series of poses and stunts, “Sherlock Holmes” is intermittently diverting. 
The visual style — a smoky, greasy, steam-punk rendering of Victorian London, full of soot and guts and bad teeth and period clothes — shows some undeniable flair. And so do the kinetic chases and scrapes that lead us through the city, as Holmes and his pal Watson (Jude Law) scramble to unravel a conspiracy so diabolical that it fails to be  interesting. Best of all is the banter between Mr. Downey and Mr. Law, who is looser and more mischievous than he’s allowed himself to be in quite some time. The mustache suits him. 
Speaking of which: the beard is Rachel McAdams. She is inserted into the picture in a pretty, flouncy red dress to add a splash of color and dispel a few hints of homoerotic subtext. Holmes and Watson are longtime roommates, with an Oscar-and-Felix routine of quarrelsome affection. Watson’s engagement to a page of half-written dialogue named Mary (Kelly Reilly) sends Holmes into a snit of jealousy, which loses some of its interesting implications when Ms. McAdams shows up as a luscious thief named Irene Adler. I wonder: is she an ancestor of Jake and Jane Adler, the main characters of “It’s Complicated,” which also opens on Friday? Or does a movie opening on Christmas need to have a character named Adler in it for some reason? 
Ms. McAdams, in any case, is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene, though she figures in a few of Conan Doyle’s stories, feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something for the ladies — who, according to airtight Hollywood corporate logic, are more likely to see a movie like this one if there’s a feisty woman in it — and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls. 
Just like Holmes and Watson! They really do, in spite of the barely sublimated physical passion they manifest for each other in nearly every scene. I’m sure Warner Brothers would like me to change the subject and tell you about the amazing diabolical conspiracy that tests Holmes’s ingenuity, along with his faith in the supremacy of reason. 
It seems that an evil aristocrat (Mark Strong), executed for a series of murders, returns from the dead to mobilize an ancient secret society that he may have time-traveled into a Dan Brown novel to learn about. Doesn’t that sound fascinating? I thought not. But there will be a sequel, for which this frantic, harmless movie serves as an extended teaser, and it looks as if it might feature Holmes’s literary archnemesis, Professor Moriarty. No doubt Holmes will break a chair over Moriarty’s head, kidney-punch him and kick him in the face. Wittily, though, like the great detective he is. 
  
“Sherlock Holmes” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of fighting and not too much girl stuff.

‽
‽It's Complicated‽,‽In the pleasurable, daffy if at times daft “It’s Complicated,” Meryl Streep plays Jane Adler, a successful restaurateur who’s about to nest happily alone in an upscale Southern California coastal community, or so it seems. Divorced with three adult children who enjoy her company (the middle one is just moving out), Jane lives in a large house on a lush sprawl surrounded by trees and no visible neighbors. It’s such a bucolic vision you half expect a few deer, a couple of bunnies and the bluebird of happiness to swing by for a visit and a quick song. Instead you get Rita Wilson trilling support as one of Jane’s close friends. 
“It’s Complicated” was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, a Hollywood filmmaker who makes female-specific indulgences that, at their irresistible best, are testaments to the power of fairy tales. Like her finest film, “Something’s Gotta Give” (2003), this new one revolves around a woman in late middle age, who, after years of going it alone in bed and out, suddenly becomes sexually and romantically involved with two very different men. What kinks up “It’s Complicated” ever so slightly is that one of the two suitors here is Jane’s former husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin), an unreconstructed womanizer now married to the much-younger Agness (Lake Bell), a hard-bellied beauty with abs and smiles of steel. 
Those intimidating abs are as important to Agness’s outsider status in the story as the kooky spelling of her name, which stands out next to the reassuringly ordinary Jane, Jake and the fourth wheel, Adam (Steve Martin), who also catches Jane’s eye. Agness enters belly first, sashaying into the opening scene as the camera and Jane both fix on Agness’s stomach, an image that underscores her fertility while also reducing her to a body part (and lopping off her head). “Something’s Gotta Give” opens on a similar thematic note with images of sylphlike young beauties striding across the screen, their legs slicing the frame. We have met the enemy, Ms. Meyers seems to be suggesting, and she is firmer  —  and younger. 
Younger, perhaps, but never better, at least in Meyersland. One of the most interesting things about Ms. Meyers’s romances is that they are pitched at a niche demographic, by which I mean women over 40. Ms. Streep looks sensational, but she and her crinkles also look close enough to her real age (60) to reassure you that she hasn’t resorted to the knife. That may sound grotesque and petty. But in an industry in which actresses whittle themselves down to nothing so they can have a little screen space only to fade away once they hit a certain age, there’s nothing trivial about a movie that insists a middle-aged woman with actual breasts and hips and wrinkles can be beautiful and desirable while also fully desiring. 
Jane’s lust (and lustiness) kicks in after she and Jake land in New York to attend the college graduation of their youngest, Luke (Hunter Parrish). After a coincidental meeting at a bar, the parents end up drinking and dancing the night away, capping their giddy evening with an off-screen bout between the sheets. Afterward a grinning Jake enthuses over the encounter, a recap that a stunned-looking Jane answers by vomiting. But if Jane has doubts, which she shares through Ms. Meyers’s customary stream of babble, the heart or maybe the head wants what it wants. Whatever the case, Jane and Jake continue their affair back home, sneaking around while their children, as well as Agness and Adam remain oblivious. 
Ms. Meyers and her interviewers like to invoke the comedies of Ernst Lubitsch (“The Shop Around the Corner”) as one of her inspirations. But watching a Grand Prix race doesn’t make you a Formula One champion. Her cinematographers tend to be first rate (John Toll shot this one), yet Ms. Meyers doesn’t have her own visual signature. What she does have is a kind of upmarket taste and the means to translate it onto the screen. Here, as in the other films she has directed, the camera is little more than a machine that takes nicely lighted pictures of the designer items, the actors included, which she has amassed and, with the exacting attention of an interior decorator, prettily arranged inside the frame. 
At the same time there’s no doubt that she is an auteur, in that the films she has directed, including “What Women Want” and “The Holiday,” express a personal vision. Being an auteur isn’t simply a matter of what you do with the camera and why; among other things, pacing also counts (and Ms. Meyers has very good comic timing when it comes to banter) as do the performances. The movie’s best moments may be, to borrow a thought from Andrew Sarris, appreciated as exquisite whimsy (he was talking about a 1935 romantic comedy), but even in such whimsy, Mr. Sarris reminds us, a  director’s touch can be “immortalized as a figure of style.” 
Ms. Meyers’s vision can be maddeningly narrow and not only because her movies take place in cosseted, largely white worlds where the help is discreetly out of view. Both “It’s Complicated” and “Something’s Gotta Give” center on an independent woman whose life, despite all its personal and professional markers, immediately expands — even as it shrinks — once a man starts rocking her bed and head. Before her first adulterous night with Jake, Jane is a melancholy solo act, whether she’s weeping in her kitchen after her daughter moves out or trading somewhat desperately raunchy sex jokes with her girlfriends. Jake’s attentions give Jane snap, vibrancy, some color in her cheeks and, most important, a comic foil. Jake, in other words, turns her into a Nancy Meyers character. 
In “It’s Complicated” Ms. Meyers transforms a divorced couple into a romantic couple, which suggests a belief in love enduring even after a marriage dies. That sounds wonderfully romantic or a prescription for pathology, maybe both. Whatever the balance between madness and madcap, classic screwball comedies involve a woman and a man meeting on the battlefield or in a newspaper office and sparring their way into coupledom. Ms. Meyers wants, as her title implies, to complicate that formula. But no matter how liberating some of her conceits, notably the older heroine, her embrace of sexist stereotypes, including male characters as agents of narrative change, keep her and her female characters down. 
And yet ... much as Diane Keaton did in “Something’s Gotta Give,” Ms. Streep, mugging wildly if winningly, takes this character and makes you love her, just as Mr. Baldwin does with Jake, who, with his shark smiles and thrusting gut, beautifully conveys male vanity in its twilight. Jane may be too perfectly dressed, coiffed and housed to be plausible. But Ms. Streep makes you believe in Jane, or rather makes you want to believe in her, from her casually chic wardrobe to the indulgent smiles she bestows on her children and lovers, all of whom need nurturing. The truth is that everyone needs a little coddling, which could be the key to Ms. Meyers’s peculiar talent: She pampers her audience shamelessly. 
“It’s Complicated” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Some tame nuzzling and a little pot smoking.

‽Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel‽,‽In the final scene of “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,” Alvin and his two brothers bed down for the night just a few feet away from three singing female chipmunks. Chipmunks are not exactly known for their restraint, which leads us to some depressing math. 
The Eastern chipmunk can produce two litters a year, with up to five young each. Thus within a decade, since cartoon chipmunks never die, there will be thousands of talking, singing chipmunks running around the animation universe, far more than the ecosystem can tolerate. They will begin showing up everywhere: stampeding through “The Simpsons,” mucking up Japanese anime, driving Clifford the Big Red Dog bonkers. Earplug sales will soar as they sing their electronically manipulated heads off. 
Anyway, the latest adventures of Alvin, Simon and Theodore find them pursuing the rock-star careers they began in the 2007 “Alvin” film (which, like this one, mixes live action and computer-generated imagery). Their human handler, Dave, ends up in traction within the first minutes of the movie, which somehow results in the boys’ being enrolled in school, which they inexplicably begin at the high school level. Or something like that. 
The school’s music program is about to be cut, so the boys enter a talent contest, planning to use the $25,000 prize to save the music department. Whichever of the writers credited here thinks $25,000 is enough to finance a high school music program needs to go to a few more school budget meetings. In any case, a girl chipmunk group, the Chipettes, is also in the hunt, providing the plot, such as it is. 
The earlier “Alvin” movie made more than $217 million just in the United States. It’s hard to imagine this somewhat confused sequel doing as well. 
“Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for a small bit of rude humor.

‽
‽Avatar‽,‽With “Avatar” James Cameron has turned one man’s dream of the movies into a trippy joy ride about the end of life — our moviegoing life included — as we know it. Several decades in the dreaming and more than four years in the actual making, the movie is a song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an Emersonian exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with Cameronian rock ’em, sock ’em pulpy action. Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the movie — one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump — is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged. 
The story behind the story, including a production budget estimated to top $230 million, and Mr. Cameron’s future-shock ambitions for the medium have already begun to settle into myth (a process partly driven by the publicity, certainly). Every filmmaker is something of a visionary, just by virtue of the medium. But Mr. Cameron, who directed the megamelodrama “Titanic” and, more notably, several of the most influential science-fiction films of the past few decades (“The Terminator,” “Aliens” and “The Abyss”), is a filmmaker whose ambitions transcend a single movie or mere stories to embrace cinema as an art, as a social experience and a shamanistic ritual, one still capable of producing the big  WOW. 
The scale of his new movie, which brings you into a meticulous and brilliantly colored alien world for a fast 2 hours 46 minutes, factors into that wow. Its scope is evident in an early scene on a spaceship (the year is 2154), where the passengers, including a paraplegic ex-Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington, a gruffly sensitive heartthrob), are being roused from a yearslong sleep before landing on a distant inhabited moon, Pandora. Jake is woken by an attendant floating in zero gravity, one of many such aides. As Jake himself glides  through the bright cavernous space, you know you’re not in Kansas anymore, as someone soon quips (a nod to “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Cameron’s favorite film). You also know you’re not in the gloom of “The Matrix.” 
Though it’s easy to pigeonhole Mr. Cameron as a gear head who’s more interested in cool tools (which here include 3-D), he is, with “Avatar,” also making a credible attempt to create a paradigm shift in science-fiction cinema. Since it was first released in 1999, “The Matrix,” which owes a large debt to Mr. Cameron’s own science-fiction films as well as the literary subgenre of cyberpunk, has hung heavily over both SF and action filmmaking. Most films that crib from “The Matrix” tend to borrow only its slo-mo death waltzes and leather fetishism, keeping its nihilism while ditching the intellectual inquiries. Although “Avatar” delivers a late kick to the gut that might be seen as nihilistic (and how!), it is strangely utopian. 
It doesn’t take Jake long to feel the good vibes. Like Neo, the savior-hero of the “Matrix” series played by Keanu Reeves, Jake is himself an avatar because he’s both a special being and an embodiment of an idea, namely that of the hero’s journey. What initially makes Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part-alien, part-human body that he controls, like a puppeteer, from its head to its prehensile tail. Like the rest of the human visitors who’ve made camp on Pandora, he has signed on with a corporation that’s intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium, a great whatsit  that is an emblem of humanity’s greed and folly. With his avatar, Jake will look just like one of the natives, the Na’vi, a new identity that gives the movie its plot turns and politics. 
The first part of Jake’s voyage — for this is, above all, a boy’s rocking adventure, if one populated by the usual tough Cameron chicks — takes him from a wheelchair into a 10-foot, blue-skinned Na’vi body. At once familiar and pleasingly exotic, the humanoid Na’vi come with supermodel dimensions (slender hips, a miniature-apple rear); long articulated digits, the better to grip with; and the slanted eyes and twitchy ears of a cat. (The gently curved stripes that line their blue skin, the color of twilight, bring to mind the markings on mackerel tabby cats.) For Jake his avatar, which he hooks into through sensors while lying in a remote pod in a semiconscious state, is at first a giddy novelty and then a means to liberation. 
Plugging into the avatar gives Jake an instant high, allowing him to run, leap and sift dirt through his toes, and freeing him from the constraints of his body. Although physically emancipated, he remains bound, contractually and existentially, to the base camp, where he works for the corporation’s top scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, amused and amusing), even while taking orders from its head of security, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a military man turned warrior for hire. A cartoon of masculinity, Quaritch strides around barking orders like some intransigent representation of American military might (or a bossy movie director). It’s a favorite Cameron type, and Mr. Lang, who until this year had long been grievously underemployed, tears into the role like a starved man gorging on steak. 
Mr. Cameron lays out the fundamentals of the narrative efficiently, grabbing you at once with one eye-popping detail after another and on occasion almost losing you with some of the comically broad dialogue. He’s a masterly storyteller if a rather less nimble prose writer. (He has sole script credit: this is personal filmmaking on an industrial scale.) Some of the clunkier lines (“Yeah, who’s bad,” Jake taunts a rhinolike creature he encounters) seem to have been written to placate those members of the Michael Bay demographic who might find themselves squirming at the story’s touchier, feelier elements, its ardent environmentalism and sincere love story, all of which kick in once Jake meets Neytiri, a female Na’vi (Zoë Saldana, seen only in slinky Na’vi form). 
Mr. Cameron has said that he started thinking about the alien universe that became Pandora and its galactic environs in “Avatar” back in the 1970s. He wrote a treatment in 1996, but the technologies he needed to turn his ideas into images didn’t exist until recently. New digital technologies gave him the necessary tools, including performance capture, which translates an actor’s physical movements into a computer-generated image (CGI). Until now, by far the most plausible character created in this manner has been slithery Gollum from Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” cycle. The exotic creatures in “Avatar,” which include an astonishment of undulating, flying, twitching and galloping organisms, don’t just crawl through the underbrush;  they thunder and shriek, yip and hiss, pointy teeth gleaming. 
The most important of these are the Na’vi, and while their movements can bring to mind old-fashioned stop-motion animation, their faces are a triumph of tech innovation, with tremors and twitches that make them immediately appealing and empathetic. By the time Neytiri ushers Jake into her world of wonders — a lush dreamscape filled with kaleidoscopic and bioluminescent flora and fauna, with pink jellyfishlike creatures that hang in the air and pleated orange flowers that snap shut like parasols — you are deep in the Na’vi-land. It’s a world that looks as if it had been created by someone who’s watched a lot of Jacques Cousteau television or, like Mr. Cameron, done a lot of diving. It’s also familiar because, like John Smith in “The New World,” Terrence Malick’s retelling of the Pocahontas story, Jake has discovered Eden. 
An Eden in three dimensions, that is. In keeping with his maximalist tendencies, Mr. Cameron has shot “Avatar” in 3-D (because many theaters are not equipped to show 3-D, the movie will also be shown  in the usual 2), an experiment that serves his material beautifully. This isn’t the 3-D of the 1950s or even contemporary films, those flicks that try to give you a virtual poke in the eye with flying spears. Rather Mr. Cameron uses 3-D to amplify the immersive experience of spectacle cinema. Instead of bringing you into the movie with the customary tricks, with a widescreen or even Imax image filled with sweeping landscapes and big action, he uses 3-D  seemingly to close the space between the audience and the screen. He brings the movie to you. 
After a few minutes the novelty of people and objects hovering above the row in front of you wears off, and you tend not to notice the 3-D, which speaks to the subtlety of its use and potential future applications. Mr. Cameron might like to play with high-tech gadgets, but he’s an old-fashioned filmmaker at heart, and he wants us to get as lost in his fictional paradise as Jake eventually does. On the face of it there might seem something absurd about a movie that asks you to thrill to a natural world made almost entirely out of zeroes and ones (and that feeds you an anticorporate line in a corporately financed entertainment). But one of the pleasures of the movies is that  they transport us, as Neytiri does with Jake, into imaginary realms, into Eden and over the rainbow to Oz. 
If the story of a paradise found and potentially lost feels resonant, it’s because “Avatar” is as much about our Earth as the universe that Mr. Cameron has invented. But the movie’s truer meaning is in the audacity of its filmmaking. 
Few films return us to the lost world of our first cinematic experiences, to that magical moment when movies really were bigger than life (instead of iPhone size), if only because we were children. Movies rarely carry us away, few even try. They entertain and instruct and sometimes enlighten. Some attempt to overwhelm us, but their efforts are usually a matter of volume. What’s often missing is awe, something Mr. Cameron has, after an absence from Hollywood, returned to the screen with a vengeance. He hasn’t changed cinema, but with blue people and pink blooms he has confirmed its wonder. 
“Avatar” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun and explosive violence, death and despair.

‽
‽Nine‽,‽“My husband makes movies,” sings Marion Cotillard, with upswept Audrey Hepburn hair and an air of resignation. We’ll have to take her word for it, since the husband in question — played in a whirl of smoking, shrugging and bravura suit wearing by Daniel Day-Lewis — seems to be busily doing everything but that. His name is Guido, and while his co-workers and admirers call him Maestro, his mastery is purely notional. He made some great films in the past, apparently, but now, in Rome in the mid-1960s, he finds himself in a professional and personal tailspin just as his new project, the vague-sounding epic  “Italia,” is about to commence shooting. 
“I can’t make this movie,” he sings. Substitute “watch” for “make” and provide your own music. “Nine,” directed by Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Memoirs of a Geisha”) from the Broadway musical  (first staged in 1982 and revived in 2003), is a movie about creative blockage and sexual confusion, but not quite in the way it wants to be. Straining to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos, less a homage to Federico Fellini’s “8 ½” (its putative inspiration) than a travesty. 
The theatrical version was built around a single set — half soundstage, half cathouse — and a handful of musically serviceable, lyrically grueling songs by Maury Yeston. The movie, written by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella, who died in 2008, adds some new numbers and opens up the scenery and the story, taking Guido and his women into the streets of Rome, to a spa on the coast nearby and into flashbacks evocative of other Fellini movies. Mr. Marshall even touches down at Cinecittà’s Studio 5, where the real maestro plied his hectic trade. 
Occasionally a flicker of genuine style emerges from all this busy, gaudy fuss. Mr. Day-Lewis does not overdo the Italian-ness, and the sardonic smile playing around his mouth may be a sign of what he thinks of it all. Ms. Cotillard attains a measure of wounded dignity as Louisa, Guido’s former leading lady and much-betrayed wife. She is not spared the striptease obligations that fall to every other female character, but at least her big song is not splintered by the clumsy, mechanical cross-cutting that seems to be Mr. Marshall’s attempt to fuse choreographic energy with cinematic brio. 
None of the rest of Guido’s ladies are so lucky. It must be said that “Nine” is an impressive feat of casting, with a shocking number of Oscar winners and nominees assembled in the service of its dubious and incoherent cause. Judi Dench is Guido’s costume designer and confidante. Penélope Cruz is his mistress, Carla, a married woman with serious mascara issues. Nicole Kidman is a Nordic actress meant to conjure memories of Anita Ekberg, though sadly she does not walk around with a kitten on her head. Sophia Loren is Guido’s Mamma, and  Kate Hudson is a Vogue reporter who flings herself in his direction. 
Stacy Ferguson, known to pop-music fans as Fergie,  is Saraghina, the village prostitute who provides the boy Guido with a glimpse of forbidden pleasures. Nice for him. The rest of us watch Ms. Ferguson  stomp and gyrate through a number called “Be Italian,” which, like so much else in “Nine,” resembles a spread in a Victoria’s Secret catalog, only less tasteful. Ms. Hudson, for her part, struts through an embarrassing hymn to “Cinema Italiano” — with inane lyrics about “hip coffee bars” and Guido’s “neo-realism” — that recalls not Visconti or Antonioni (or even the Italian sex farces of the 1970s) but rather those lubricious Berlusconi-esque variety shows that baffle and titillate visitors from other countries who turn on their hotel-room television sets. 
Those spectacles at least come by their sleaze honestly. “Nine” dresses up its coarseness  in bogus  prestige, which both kills the fun and exposes an emptiness at the project’s heart — a fatal lack of inspiration. The fear of such a void is what animates the Guido character played by Marcello Mastroianni in “8 ½,” a man whose vanity, tenderness and narcissism mirrored Fellini’s own, and whose anxiety at the prospect of failing as an artist and a man made him a vivid and credible hero. That psychological dimension is missing from “Nine,” which never finds a way to communicate either the romantic ardor or the artistic passion that would make Mr. Day-Lewis’s Guido interesting. 
Instead he just comes off as a jerk, a compulsive liar and seeker of attention — and, in spite of the sports cars, the cigarettes and the occasional run-in with the Roman Catholic Church, not really very Italian at all. The best that can be said about “Nine” is that its affections are sincere, though you could say the same about its hero, who has the misfortune of being in a movie that’s an even worse mess than he is. 
“Nine” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Lingerie and cigarettes, but no real heat.

‽
‽Did You Hear About the Morgans?‽,‽There are barely enough titter-worthy one-liners in Marc Lawrence’s good-natured romantic comedy “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” to prevent it from sinking under the weight of its clichés. Most of the throwaway witticisms drop from the pursed lips of Hugh Grant, playing Paul Morgan, a New York lawyer with Oxonian airs reluctantly transplanted to a tiny Wyoming town as part of the federal witness protection program. 
After he and his wife, Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker), a high-end New York real-estate broker, accidentally see the murder of an international arms dealer and are spotted by the killer (Michael Kelly), they have no choice but to be whisked away to cowboy country under the pseudonyms Paul and Meryl Foster. Their hosts, the laconic, growly voiced United States Marshal Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott) and his rootin’-tootin’ cowgirl wife, Emma (Mary Steenburgen), teach the effete city slickers the simpler, more wholesome ways of the West. They also show these spoiled, high-maintenance neurotics how to have a relationship. Their secret? Just shut up and make it work! 
The sleeping arrangements in the Morgans’ temporary refuge are dicey because of one major complication: Paul and Meryl have separated. Meryl won’t forgive her husband for a one-night stand, despite his pleading and groveling to be taken back. As she harangues him about his breach of trust, you are acutely aware that the shelf life of Carrie Bradshaw and her knockoffs is on the verge of expiration. Despite Ms. Parker’s strenuous efforts to charm, Meryl comes across as a shrill, self-centered middle-aged nag. Behavior that appeared kooky and cute at 34 seems pathologically immature a decade later. 
Mr. Grant is more at ease, possibly because of his previous association with Mr. Lawrence, who wrote and directed “Music and Lyrics” and “Two Weeks  Notice,” in which Mr. Grant also starred. In the work of Mr. Lawrence, whose other credits include collaborating on the screenplays of the two “Miss Congeniality” films, you know what you’re getting: comedy with mostly likable, broadly drawn characters; tart, nonthreatening social satire with sharp enough teeth to leave an impression while not breaking the skin; and well-timed, modestly sophisticated repartee. 
In plunking upscale blue-state urbanites into red-state territory, “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” adroitly avoids condescending to either side. The movie’s sole political reference is its mention of the 14 Democrats in the overwhelmingly Republican town. That statistic is dropped by Wilford Brimley, playing a grouchy geezer at a local cafe who takes offense when Meryl asks him to direct his cigarette smoke away from her table. “We’re not fond of city people telling us how to live,” he grumbles. 
Once in Wyoming, Meryl, a vegetarian and a member of PETA, finds herself surrounded by stuffed animal heads in a house whose refrigerator is crammed with meat. 
Emma, a whiz with a shotgun and an ax, jokes that for her the acronym stands for People Eating Tasty Animals. 
Wyoming nights are so quiet that Paul remarks, “I thought I heard my cells dividing.” Consuming a hearty breakfast of bacon, eggs and pancakes makes him worry that he should have an angiogram. He is pathetically inept at chopping wood. The kickback from shooting a gun sends him to the doctor. Such jokes come with enough regularity that just as the movie seems about to fall asleep, a mild comic jolt wakes it up. 
“Did You Hear About the Morgans?” belongs more to the Wheelers than to its title characters. Mr. Elliott, 65, is everybody’s senior-cowboy fantasy: the Marlboro man three decades later, still oozing laid-back virility. Ms. Steenburgen’s Emma suggests an older, wiser, more grounded Sarah Palin type, comfortable in her skin and her Western gear. 
“Did You Hear About the Morgans?” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

‽
‽Ricky‽,‽There is no indication in the early scenes of François Ozon’s “Ricky” that the movie, which begins as a harshly realistic portrait of working-class parenthood in the gritty mode of a Dardenne brothers film, will turn into a magical-realist fable. Even after its metamorphosis, its notion of a baby who  sprouts wings and flies is no cutesy Disney fantasy of an infant Superman confidently zooming hither and yon. Like a moth involuntarily drawn to the light, Ricky (Arthur Peyret), the child of Katie (Alexandra Lamy) and Paco (Sergi Lopez), both highly stressed assembly-line workers in a French cosmetics factory, bumps into walls, hurls himself at windows and is in continual peril. 
Even for a filmmaker as gifted as Mr. Ozon (“Swimming Pool,” “Under the Sand”), the transition from one style to another a third of the way into the movie is almost impossible to carry off seamlessly. But that may be the point. Even in the happiest families, parenthood, for all its joys, brings no end of anxiety and unwelcome surprise. No child is exactly like any other. For all the rules that have been laid down, child rearing is still largely a matter of playing it by ear. 
As the movie, freely adapted from “Moth,” a short story by Rose Tremain, set in an American trailer park, rubs its genres together, it creates a sense of discomfort. In the first part, the equilibrium of a family of two — Katie and her 7-year-old daughter, Lisa (Mélusine Mayance) — is disturbed when Paco, the gruff, good-hearted Spaniard with whom Katie first hooks up in a factory lavatory, moves into their apartment in a housing project. 
The movie becomes a microscopic examination of shifting family dynamics with the birth of their child, Ricky, a noisy, demanding boy who takes attention away from Lisa, who in one scene is shown secretly clipping his wings. The camera stares fixedly at the visceral side of infancy, the baby suckling and soiling himself, the biological mother-child bond, the father’s sleeplessness and irritation, the sibling rivalry and the underlying parental fears for the baby’s safety. Where most films about children coo, giggle and turn misty-eyed, “Ricky” is pointedly unromantic. 
The first signs of the wings that will sprout from Ricky’s shoulder blades are what appear to be bruises, which Katie notices after leaving him in Paco’s care. Your heart sinks when she accuses him of abusing the child; he denies it and stalks out of the house. 
The wings that grow are not snowy angel’s wings but birdlike appendages, much like the bony chicken wings that are Lisa’s favorite part of the fowl when a roast is served. After Ricky is discovered perched high on a shelf, a blanket is put over his crib to keep him safe. But his drive to be airborne is unstoppable. He becomes a public curiosity after Katie takes him to a supermarket,  and he breaks free to career wildly among the fluorescent lights while the shoppers ogle him, and police officers, firefighters and television crews rush to the scene. 
At this point “Ricky” chooses to play down the unending media frenzy that would greet the phenomenon of a flying baby. One concerned, not terribly aggressive doctor who insists that Ricky needs special care is allowed to stand for the medical profession. 
The deeper “Ricky” plunges into allegory, the shakier its grasp of the material. Paco is eager to exploit Ricky for money and achieve a better life for the family. But having brought up the commercialization of Ricky, the movie abandons the issue. When Ricky flies away after Katie accidentally lets go of the string holding him during an outdoor television interview, the film disappears with him.

‽
‽Invictus‽,‽It may not seem obvious at first, but Clint Eastwood’s “Invictus,” a rousing true story of athletic triumph, is also that director’s latest exploration of revenge, the defining theme of his career. It is hard to think of an actor or a filmmaker who so cleanly embodies a single human impulse in the way that Mr. Eastwood — from “Pale Rider” to “Mystic River,” from Dirty Harry to “Gran Torino” — personifies the urge to get even. 
He has also, of course, taken a critical view of the drive for vengeance, investigating its tragic roots and terrible consequences. A movie like “Unforgiven,” most famously, suggests that violent revenge is regrettable. But rarely, in the world of Mr. Eastwood’s films, is it avoidable. 
“Invictus” is to some degree an exception, a movie about reconciliation and forgiveness — about the opposite of revenge — that gains moral authority precisely because the possibility of bloodshed casts its shadow everywhere. The film, based on John Carlin’s book “Playing the Enemy,” takes place in South Africa in the mid-1990s, just after Nelson Mandela’s election as the country’s first black president. Many of the whites in the film —  most of them Afrikaner nationalists still attached to a system that kept their black compatriots poor, disenfranchised and oppressed  —  brace themselves for payback as  Mandela assumes power. Quite a few of the president’s black supporters expect it, too, as their due after decades of brutality and humiliation under apartheid. 
But Mandela, played with gravity, grace and a crucial spark of mischief by Morgan Freeman, knows that score-settling would be a disastrous course for a new and fragile democracy. Passing by a newsstand on the morning after his victory, he spots a headline in Afrikaans. He has shown that he can win an election, it says, but will he show that he can govern? His bodyguards bristle at a pre-emptive low blow from a hostile press, but Mandela shrugs. “It’s a fair question,” he says. 
And a perennially urgent one in any democracy. Mr. Eastwood and the screenwriter, Anthony Peckham, are too absorbed in the details of the story at hand to suggest historical analogies, but “Invictus” has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss. It’s an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership. 
But much of the ingenuity in Mr. Freeman’s performance lies in the way he conveys that idealism and the shrewd manipulation of symbols and emotions are not incompatible, but complementary. Taking power a few years after being released from 27 years of incarceration, Mandela is already a larger-than-life figure, an idol in South Africa and around the world. His celebrity is something of a burden, and also an asset he must learn to use; his moral prestige is a political weapon. 
But he is preoccupied, to the dismay of loyalists in his movement, with finding some kind of concord — not friendship, necessarily, but at least a state of non-enmity — with the people who hate and fear him: the whites who see him as a terrorist, a usurper and a threat to their traditions and values. Mandela’s overtures to the Afrikaners — starting with his refusal to dismiss white members of the presidential staff and security detail — arise partly out of Gandhian principle, and partly out of political calculation. They are a powerful force in the army, the police and the South African economy. 
Mandela’s aides — in particular Brenda Mazibuko (Adjoa Andoh) — are baffled when he takes up the cause of the South African rugby team, a symbol of stiff-necked Afrikaner pride despised by most blacks. The team’s Springbok mascot, named for a kind of gazelle, and its green-and-gold uniforms are nearly as loathsome as the apartheid flag, and when Mandela insists that the colors be retained, it seems almost like a betrayal of his life’s cause. South Africa, a pariah in the world of international sports for a long time (“the skunk of the world,” as Mandela puts it), is preparing to host the Rugby World Cup, and Mandela decides that if the nation is to find unity and self-respect the underachieving Springboks must win the championship. 
And so an alliance develops between the president and François Pienaar, the Springbok captain, played with crisp, disciplined understatement (and utter mastery of a devilishly tricky accent) by Matt Damon. Pienaar’s struggle to keep control of his team, and also to persuade them to accept some perplexing new social realities, is a microcosm of Mandela’s larger project. And he quietly accepts Mandela, who shares with Pienaar the Victorian poem that gives the movie its title, as a mentor. 
Beyond the politician, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Eastwood allow us glimpses of a complicated and somewhat melancholy man, carrying the loneliness of his long imprisonment with him and estranged from much of his family. He is gracious and charming in small groups, a stiff but compelling public speaker and a boss whose authority is buttressed by a phalanx of devoted, sometimes skeptical aides. 
But if “Invictus” is predominantly an absorbing character study of one of the most extraordinary characters of our time, it is also fleshed out with well-sketched minor players and subplots that illuminate the progress of racial rapprochement in its comic human dimension. The black bodyguards and their white colleagues proceed from hostility to wary tolerance to guarded warmth in a way that is pointed without being overstated. And that, for the most part, characterizes Mr. Eastwood’s direction, which is always unassuming, unhurried and efficient. In this film he tells a big story through a series of small, well-observed moments, and tells it in his usual blunt, matter-of-fact way, letting the nuances take care of themselves. 
And once again, as in “Letters From Iwo Jima” — a tragic rather than heroic inquiry into the nature of leadership — they do. “Invictus” is more sprawling than that film, and more willing to  risk hokiness. That is a chance Mr. Eastwood is often happy to take, and no genre is more susceptible to it (or earns it more honestly) than the victorious-underdog team-sports movie. That the sport is as alien to most Americans as it is to black South Africans presents its challenges, but by the end you might care about rugby more than you thought you would, even if it remains harder to understand than politics. 
The convergence of the two provides an occasion for some potent, intelligent filmmaking — a movie that hits you squarely with its visceral impact and stays in your mind for a long time after. 
“Invictus” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing, the threat of violence and brutal sports action. 
INVICTUS 
Opens on Friday nationwide.  
Directed by Clint Eastwood; written by Anthony Peckham, based on the book “Playing the Enemy” by John Carlin; director of photography, Tom Stern; edited by Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach; music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens; production designer, James J. Murakami; produced by Mr.  Eastwood, Lori McCreary, Robert Lorenz and Mace Neufeld; released by Warner Brothers Pictures. Running time: 2 hours 14 minutes. WITH: Morgan Freeman (Nelson Mandela), Matt Damon (François Pienaar) and Adjoa Andoh (Brenda Mazibuko).

‽Hannah Free‽,‽In “Hannah Free,” a clanking, sudsy tear-jerker about longtime lesbian lovers languishing in the same Michigan nursing home in the 1990s, Sharon Gless plays Hannah, a cantankerous resident prevented by the staff from visiting her partner, Rachel, who lies in a coma after a stroke. 
But Ms. Gless, 66, is much too young and vital to be playing a character who is probably 20 years older (Hannah and Rachel were childhood friends in the 1920s, before Rachel married and had children.) Her broad, hammy portrayal of a free-spirited butch lesbian bridling against authority conveys the same punchy heartiness she brought to Debbie Novotny, the mother of a gay son in “Queer as Folk.” 
The movie, directed by Wendy Jo Carlton, began life as a play by Claudia Allen, who adapted it for the screen. Scenes in which Hannah converses at length with the younger incarnation of Rachel (Ann Hagemann) make no attempt to disguise their origins on the stage. 
In flashbacks, Rachel, already a widow, continually berates the younger Hannah (Kelli Strickland) for repeatedly leaving to see the world. Rachel is happy to stay in the same small Michigan town where the two women grew up amid raised eyebrows and whispers. 
“Hannah Free” is what used to be called a problem play. The issues it addresses include the condescending treatment of the elderly and Christian proselytizing to the bedridden, the generational divide in attitudes toward homosexuality, the attempts of strait-laced family members to freeze out a same-sex partner at the end of life, and the final decisions for patients on life support. 
An angelic rescuer appears in the person of Rachel’s great-granddaughter Greta (Jacqui Jackson), who helps Hannah defy the rules laid down by Rachel’s puritanical daughter Marge (Taylor Miller). Greta represents an enlightened younger generation for whom sexual orientation is no big deal. 
HANNAH FREE

‽Transylmania‽,‽“Transylmania,” a vampire-hunter, college road trip sex comedy, has a problem: someone has drained all the laughs out of it. It’s destined to spend a short and painful life in theaters and then join the ranks of the DVD and late-night-cable undead. 
The directors David and Scott Hillenbrand, who were  responsible for the National Lampoon “Dorm Daze” movies, and the screenwriters Patrick Casey and Joshua Miller  (known as Worm Miller) have stuffed this cabbage with doltish and buxom students, sadistic dwarfs, severed heads, serial vomiting, sheep testicles, a priest with Tourette’s syndrome and horse flatulence. (That’s a “Young Frankenstein” homage: the horses let loose whenever someone says the name of the Transylvanian university where the action is set.) The Romanian vampires and the actors playing the American undergrads are both, in their own ways, long in the tooth. 
The plot concerns vampire possession, mistaken identity, medieval sex techniques and the dangers of meeting Eastern European women online. (A tip: make sure you see her back before you buy the plane ticket.) It’s an excuse for a long series of jokes, almost none of which deliver. “Call me a nurse while you’re at it,” an impaled student tells a dishy vampire hunter. 
“O.K., you’re a nurse,” she replies. That’s actually one of the funnier moments in the film, along with a truly tasteless bit involving Siegfried, Roy and a tiger puppet. Beyond that, the only things to look forward to are the snippets of “Bad Moon Rising” on the soundtrack. 
“Transylmania” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Female breasts and male buttocks.

‽
‽Armored‽,‽“There’s no bad guys here,” says Matt Dillon early in “Armored,” a blunt and unpretentious action thriller too unassuming to show itself in advance to critics. Since the trailers have promised mayhem, and since this is Mr. Dillon in his whispery, hollow-cheeked, sinister mode, we have reason to doubt his word. And sure enough, before too long the guns come out, and what was supposed to be a clean, bloodless crime turns foul and messy. 
But Mr. Dillon’s character, an armored-truck guard named Mike Cochrane, is not entirely off base. He and his colleagues, who plan to steal $42 million from one of their company’s vehicles, are not the kind of evil geniuses who usually plot and scheme in a movie like this. They are, all in all, fairly ordinary guys, just desperate and dumb enough to turn mean when things go wrong. 
In addition to Cochrane, the senior members of this miscreant crew are Quinn (Jean Reno), a cool customer, and Baines (Laurence Fishburne), a boisterous hothead. There is also a nervous,  skinny guy named Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich) and a brooding Bible reader named Palmer (Amaury Nolasco). 
The weak link, the pivot on which the story turns — and the mostly good guy who needs Cochrane’s reassurance that they aren’t bad guys — is Ty Hackett (Columbus Short), whose troubles make it hard for him to say no to the prospect of easy money. An Iraq veteran with a shoulder full of scar tissue, a younger brother to care for (their parents are dead) and a battered house that the bank is threatening to seize, he reluctantly goes along with the heist and immediately comes to regret his decision. 
“Armored,” from a script by the first-timer James V. Simpson, was directed by Nimrod Antal,  whose interest in working men and their vehicles was demonstrated in his debut film, the Hungarian-language “Kontroll,” about Budapest subway workers.  It is blessedly short, simple and sincere, with no great ambitions to pursue or statements to make. 
The norm in the crime-and-violence genre is bloated, cruel, empty nonsense like “Law-Abiding Citizen.”  “Armored” not only has a lower body count, but it is also in possession of a conscience and a soul, like Ty, its battered hero. The movie makes you feel the weight of the greed and brutality it depicts, and it does not take killing lightly. 
Ty’s circumstances resonate because they are the picture’s premise rather than its point, just as the abandoned factory where much of the action takes place is a mute emblem of industrial decline and economic blight. When one of the robbers sees the bundles of fresh cash, he leans down and inhales deeply, describing what he smells as “freedom.” 
He’s not joking, and there is something very sad at the core of “Armored,” a bleakness captured in the cinematography of Andrzej Sekula (whose other credits include “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction”). This is decidedly not an earnest, award-soliciting drama about a soldier’s return or a working-class family facing foreclosure, but it incorporates some hard facts of contemporary life with quiet passion and conviction. 
Not to worry, though; there is plenty of noise. Mr. Antal, classically trained at the Hungarian Academy of Drama and Film, has an old-fashioned, functional style. He knows how to crash a truck, and also how to build tension out of elemental situations and economical camera movements. He has made an unabashed B movie: basic, brutal and sometimes clumsy, but far from dumb, and not bad at all. 
“Armored” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Fairly restrained language and violence, given the story.

‽
‽Leonard Cohen: Bird on a Wire‽,‽The brilliant poet, novelist, musician and singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, who died in November at 82, became a superstar as a senior. He brought his earnest voice and moody guitar into the 1960s counterculture when he was in his early 30s, and he made a substantial impact musically well into the 1970s. In that time, he was a cult artist on a very large scale, so to speak. But after the explosive popularity of his oft-covered 1984 song, “Hallelujah,” and a management swindle that obliged him to become a road dog to restore his income, he became an arena-filling legend and, to his hard-core fans, a prophet. 
Mr. Palmer captures all this with a keen eye. The movie is a worthy time capsule and a must for Cohen devotees. Its occasional meanderings into artiness, which take the form of interpolation of outside footage (war atrocities and home movies, mainly) are emblematic of the time it was made and mercifully brief. 
‽
‽General Orders No. 9‽,‽“General Orders No. 9” is a tone poem laid over 72 minutes’ worth of images, many of them lovely, and is, as its press material says, “unlike any film you have ever seen.” The concept seems bold on first look, but if you stop and break down the ideas that Robert Persons, the writer and director, seems to be presenting, they’re actually rather retro. 
Mr. Persons has written a poem (William Davidson is the narrator) centered on Georgia, looking back to when it was pristine landscape unmolested by people. He spends a good deal of time serving up pastoral images, making generous use of cross-dissolves, and you begin to think this is a mere ode to nature. 
But about 27 minutes in, an interloper shows up: the highway. “The interstate does not serve, it possesses,” the poem says. “It has the power to make the land invisible to our attention.” 
Then Mr. Persons makes his way from rural to urban landscape, and he’s not happy about it. “The city is not a place, it’s a thing,” the poem says. “It has none of the marks of a place, but all of those of a machine.” 
Yet the urban images he presents are missing the thing that makes any city come alive: human beings. You begin to suspect that Mr. Persons hates humanity. This makes “General Orders No. 9,” for all its sheen of sophistication, rather simplistic: people bad, nature good. 
GENERAL ORDERS NO. 9 
Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.

‽
‽Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?‽,‽Answering its own question, Taggart Siegel’s revelatory documentary “Queen of the Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?” would like us to know that its fuzzy subjects are starving, sick and stressed out. Examining the alarming phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder, Mr. Siegel buzzes around the globe and deep into the hive; what he finds is an insect done in by human insult. 
“Their crisis is our crisis,” an organic beekeeper says. (One of the film’s frequent surprises is that there are almost as many species of beekeeper as honeybee.) Because nearly half of our food production depends on bee pollination, the fate of this 100 million-year-old insect is intimately linked to our own. And with millions of bee colonies already lost in America alone, the dire predictions of Rudolf Steiner seem about to be fulfilled. 
Pointing the finger at pesticides, single-crop farming (requiring that the tiny creatures be forcibly shuttled around the country for pollination) and the industrialization of beekeeping itself (including inbreeding and injections of high-fructose corn syrup), “Queen of the Sun” offers a glimpse into imminent beepocalypse. 
But Mr. Siegel is no Cassandra: retaining the waggish tone of his previous documentary, “The Real Dirt on Farmer John” (released in 2007), he balances the doom-talking heads with cute animation and characters like Yvon Achard, a French “bee historian” who caresses the swarm with his elaborately styled facial hair. 
“They like!” he announces gleefully, though it’s difficult to tell. What is clear, though — thanks to the film’s tropically saturated cinematography and crystalline lighting — is that their honey has never looked so delicious. Or so precious.

‽
‽Hadewijch‽,‽Bruno Dumont’s austere, grimly luminous film “Hadewijch” takes its title from the name of a 13th-century poet, Hadewijch of Antwerp, whose work “The Paradoxes of Love” describes the agony and ecstasy of her 21st-century French namesake. A virginal 20-year-old theology student who is first seen in a monastery where she is preparing to take her vows, Hadewijch, as she is called by the nuns, spends much of her time on her knees, praying before a cross on the wall above her bunk bed in a bare, cell-like room. 
Refusing to eat or to dress for the cold, she is so fanatically devout that the Mother Superior takes her aside, sternly admonishes her for her “self-love,” describes her as “a caricature of a nun” and expels her from the convent until she has more experience in the world. In tears, Hadewijch, whose secular name is Céline, returns to Paris, where she lives with her parents —  a cabinet minister she describes as “a jerk” and his wife —  in chilly, palatial splendor. 
The film is a profound exploration of the paradoxes described in the poem, as experienced by Céline (Julie Sokolowski), who struggles to resolve her simultaneous sense of intimate connection with God and infinite distance from him. In the lines from Mother Columba Hart’s translation of the poem, which accompanies the production notes, “Her despair is assurance;/Her sorest wounding is all curing.” 
The film repeatedly seeks to evoke that contradictory sense of connection and alienation, not only in fervent Christianity but also in Islam, and it examines how the relentless pursuit of ultimate faith drives people to violent acts that are public manifestations of self-mortification. 
Like all of Mr. Dumont’s films, “Hadewijch” conjures the strange electricity (you might call it auras) around people, as if peeling away an outer layer of reality. The movie studies faces and bodies to locate the essence of humanness, especially in the eyes, behind which it finds both bestial and spiritual impulses and locates a primal isolation, as well as a lurking violence. One long-held shot of Céline has the transfixing power of a psychic or spiritual X-ray in which you sense her entire being. 
This cosmic view of humanity is so harsh and penetrating that it allows for little if any humor. And viewers who are not on Mr. Dumont’s wavelength tend to dismiss his work as pretentious, glum and boring. Those who follow him, however, will find themselves in the rarefied territory of Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson and Carl Dreyer. 
Every shot in the movie is an exquisitely rendered tableau that conveys the mysteries of life as contemplated by Céline. A repeated image of a church atop a hill, seen from below, suggests the spiritual distance she must travel without ever reaching it: a lofty, faraway destination in a landscape whose very beauty awakens an ineffable longing. If “Hadewijch” is Mr. Dumont’s most overtly religious film, it is not pro-faith in any specific way, although the director clearly respects the religious impulse. 
Céline, having returned to secular life, is befriended by Yassine (Yassine Salime), a young Arab layabout who lives with his older brother, Nassir (Karl Sarafidis),  in the projects on the fringe of Paris. Her curiosity about Islam prompts Nassir to invite her to a discussion group on “the notion of the invisible,” and they embark on a protracted dialogue on religious faith in which Nassir speaks abstractly of violence and “the fight.” 
Typical of a film by Mr. Dumont, “Hadewijch” makes sudden leaps without filling in the details. After Céline rebuffs the advances of Yassine, who calls her “nuts,” Nassir becomes her spiritual mentor, and they travel to an unidentified Middle Eastern country (the sequence was filmed in Lebanon), where they arrive just after a bombing. Céline is shown having tea with the members of what appears to be a terrorist group and swearing to carry out some unspecified mission. Then she is back in France. 
Periodically, the movie focuses on David (David Dewaele), a gaunt young parolee working on the monastery property who observes Céline’s comings and goings. His presence remains mysterious until the very end, when he becomes an ambiguous redemptive symbol who “saves” Céline after she has committed two desperate acts. 
“Hadewijch” and the forthcoming “Of Gods and Men” (shown at this year’s New York Film Festival) suggest that for all the talk of France’s metamorphosis into a secular society, powerful religious and spiritual fires still burn there.

‽Gulliver's Travels‽,‽To: A. O. Scott 
From: Jonathan Swift  [stellasdude@gmail.com] 
Subj: Gulliver’s Travels 
Esteemed Sir: 
On my return from the recent shewing of “Gulliver’s Travels,” whereat I was sufficiently fortunate to pass a choice moment on the Red Carpet in the charming Company of Miss Emily Blunt, I find it politick to communicate with yourself on the topick of this Motion Picture. Surely I state what can only be apparent to any man not a Jackass when I observe that it bears little relation to my original Work. Perhaps you construe that my intent in this epistle is to thunder against a grievous misappropriation of my Book, but please be assured that I have no such complaint. An Apple is but an Apple, while an Orange is some other thing. 
Apples, it should be noted, figure prominently among the Products attractively displayed in the course of this Entertainment, which passes, if you will permit me to say so, Swiftly enough — not unlike a small, unvexing Kidney Stone. Much display is also made of other Intellectual Properties belonging, like “Gulliver’s Travels,” to The News Corporation, at whose Fox News Channel I have vainly sought a berth for many years, believing that my publick embrace of Conservative Principles and my long service to the Church might find preferment there. But no. Apparently I am viewed in those quarters as a Tory in Name Only, and an Elitist to boot. Nor have Mr. Colbert’s people replied to my earnest entreaties. 
But such unhappy Matters need not detain us here. Indulge, rather, my views on “Gulliver’s Travels,” which somewhat cleverly converts my great Satire into a gaudy, puerile Toy. My avowed purpose in composing that text, as any swot who has suffered the Duty and Dullness rampant in our Schools must know, was to employ my modest pen as a scourge against human Folly and the vanities of the Age. Having deemed itself unable to defeat those foes, this rendition of “Gulliver’s Travels” chuses rather to join them. 
The purveyors of the Amusement have superadded to the Spectacle a third dimension, the main Effect of which is to expand the already extensive Belly and Buttocks of Mr. Jack Black, a rotund Clown charged with the task of impersonating Lemuel Gulliver. My storied Voyager is thus converted to yet another fellow of slack Ambition and ample Gut, toiling at a Loser Job and pining for his Stella (or Darcy, as she is here called), a woman of quick Intellect and slender Frame, in whose League he is so totally not. Though of course we never are permitted to doubt that this Stella will smile upon him in the end, and do so moreover with the glorious and gleaming Teeth of Miss Amanda Peet. 
Only a few of the true Gulliver’s journeys, to Lilliput and, briefly, to the land of the Brobdingnags, fall within the narrow Compass of this Narrative, which has been transported from my Time to yours. Withal, the Lilliputians are, in some wise, much as I had envisioned them — tiny creatures, indeed, but also proud and ingenious. They are ruled by the noted comickal personage Billy Connolly, whose daughter the Princess is portrayed by the fetching Miss Blunt, upon whom your correspondent must confess he has no inconsiderable Crush. So too, and more to the point of the tale, do the arrogant Soldier embodied by Chris O’Dowd and a local fellow of slack Ambition, etc., etc., performed by Jason Segel. Perhaps you wish to venture a prophecy as to which of them will, at the last, receive the favor of the Princess. 
Now, my good Sir, I hope I do not err in venturing a Comparison. Perhaps you are familiar with “Night at the Museum”? Indeed, I observe that you have offered learned Commentary on its second Episode, “Battle of the Smithsonian” — though I confess that I was unable to discern from your Prose whether it met with your full Approbation. To put the matter briefly: This is more or less like That (which also issued from the mighty hand of The News Corporation) insofar as it offers agreeable Novelties and inoffensive jests. 
For myself, I was but seldom inspired to peals of true laughter, though I did relish that part when Mr. Black, confronting a fire raging in the Palace of Lilliput, douses the blaze through heroic use of such means as Nature has provided him. This was, indeed, the only moment at which it seemed that the temperament of the Picture corresponded, in some degree, to my own. 
To grumble further would be, as the saying goes, akin to pointing my Water toward the Wind. I note that Mr. Black has, in other endeavors, proved himself a Mocker after my own heart, but I can hardly begrudge him the greater emolument that issues from cavorting in the mildly naughty manner of an overgrown tot. I can further suppose that a Child of average Wit or even moderate Dullness — a boy of Nine, let us say, who can be coaxed away from the Wii of a Christmas afternoon — might pass a pleasant interval chuckling at the absurd incongruities that arise when something very large is placed beside something very small. Nor will this notional child’s elder companion be subject to inordinate Anguish, much as he might wish himself in the place of those unencumbered souls thronging the adjacent Room to see “True Grit.” 
As for your correspondent, since a further encounter with the charming Miss Blunt seems altogether improbable, I will decline to undertake a second voyage to “Gulliver’s Travels,” chusing instead to devote myself to the preparation of my customary Holiday Feast, a delectable Stew made from the flesh of Irish Babies. (JK! ROTFL!) 
I remain, Sir, your most hmble &amp; obdt svt,J. Swift. 
Post Scriptum: It is suggested that children attend this Motion Picture under the Guidance of Parents, as a few mild oaths are uttered, and the humor is at moments more Salty than Sweet.

‽
‽Secret Sunshine‽,‽“Secret Sunshine” — a 2007 film by Lee Chang-dong now making a tardy but welcome American debut — takes place in a South Korean town called Miryang, described by one of its residents  as “just like every other place.” This is true enough, and Mr. Lee is certainly attentive to the routines and rhythms of everyday life. But there is nothing ordinary about this movie, or about the story it tells. 
On its surface the transparent and horrifying tale of a mother’s grief, “Secret Sunshine” has the kind of emotional depth and thematic complexity that rewards repeat viewings. Mr. Lee, a distinguished novelist before he turned to filmmaking (he has also served as South Korea’s minister of culture and tourism), composes the cinematic equivalent of prose that is clear, elegant and lyrical. The experience of watching his films is not always pleasant: more than a few scenes in “Secret Sunshine” (and in the more recent, equally amazing “Poetry,” a highlight of this year’s New York Film Festival) are excruciating in their raw depiction of souls in torment. And yet his quiet and exacting humaneness infuses even the most dreadful moments with an intimation of grace. 
At its most literal, the title of “Secret Sunshine” refers to an old meaning of the word Miryang.   At the beginning of the movie, Lee Shin-ae (Jeon Do-yeon), recently widowed, moves to the town with her young son, Jun. Miryang was her husband’s  childhood home, but Shin-ae is nonetheless very much a stranger. Befriended by Kim Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), an amiable mechanic who tows her broken-down car into town, she goes about the business of making a new life for herself and Jun. She gives piano lessons, chats politely with local shopkeepers, and stoically endures the nosiness and coldness of some of the townspeople while cautiously welcoming the kindness of others. The place seems, for a while, to live up to its name, insofar as its warmth is not always immediately apparent. 
Then something happens that both upends Shin-ae’s fragile sense of control and turns the film from a quiet comedy of provincial life into a tour of parental hell. There are trailers online that make it pretty clear, and a cursory search of what has been written about “Secret Sunshine” since its premiere in Cannes more than three years ago will supply plenty of spoilers. But I’m still reluctant to say too much, since the full impact of this film is perhaps best experienced if its shocks are uncushioned by foreknowledge. Shin-ae, after all, has no idea what horrors await her in Miryang, and Mr. Lee has a remarkable ability to refrain from foreshadowing. The ribbon of his narrative bends and loops, but it does not twist. 
In the wake of tragedy, Shin-ae looks for solace in routine — scolding her recalcitrant students with renewed rigor — and then in religion. She begins attending revival meetings at a local evangelical church, embracing its gospel of boundless love and ready forgiveness. But further disappointments and devastations lie in store, as the film, without succumbing to glib cynicism, refuses any easy route toward comfort or redemption. 
How do you make a movie about an unbearable experience that is not itself unbearable? The answer will come close to a sturdy and time-tested definition of art, one job of which is to give intelligible and therefore consoling form to the agonies of human life. And therefore, also, to discern within the worst of what people can inflict and endure at least a hint of brighter possibilities. The title of “Secret Sunshine” thus becomes both its moral and a description of its curiously illuminating qualities. Conjuring a picture of absolute darkness, it nonetheless casts a beam of light. 
Some of this comes from Ms. Jeon, who started out on South Korean television and who deservedly won the award for best female performance in Cannes for this role. Shin-ae, though a victim of terrible and cosmically unfair circumstances, is not entirely innocent or sympathetic. But of course nobody really is, and the inconsistencies Ms. Jeon finds in her character’s personality are evidence of the coherence of her performance. There is nothing to do but believe in her. 
And yet the sheer, fearless intensity Ms. Jeon brings to “Secret Sunshine” would overwhelm the film were it not balanced by Mr. Song’s relaxed geniality.  Kim’s relentless pursuit of Shin-ae — always eager to help, he follows her everywhere she goes, including into the arms of the Lord — is sometimes creepy, sometimes pathetic, but it also provides her with a consistent and supportive human presence. Kim is described, in a conversation with one of his friends, as a character more at home in comedy than in melodrama, which describes his role in Shin-ae’s life, and Mr. Song’s in the film, almost too perfectly. 
To praise the perfection of “Secret Sunshine” would be to risk misrepresenting its main virtue, which is its attention to minor infelicities and inconveniences as well as to unspeakable crimes and intolerable heartaches. It is a great movie, by a major figure in world cinema.

‽
‽True Grit‽,‽That old-time American religion of vengeance runs like a river through “True Grit,” a comic-serious tale about some nasty, brutish times. Beautifully adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen from the parodic western novel by Charles Portis, it turns on a 14-year-old Arkansas girl who hires a “one-eyed fat man” to hunt down her father’s killer. First published in 1968, Mr. Portis’s tall tale was brought to the screen the next year custom-fitted for John Wayne, who rode the role of that fat man, Rooster Cogburn, straight to an Oscar. Now it’s the thinner scene-stealer Jeff Bridges who sits and sometimes drunkenly slumps in the saddle. 
Much as he did in the raucously entertaining original film directed by Henry Hathaway, Rooster enters on his best behavior, seated in a courtroom amid a fog of cigar smoke and conspicuous lies. The pale, ghostly light comes courtesy of the Coens’ frequent cinematographer, Roger Deakins, while many of the twisty, funny sentences have been plucked by the filmmakers right from the novel. A deputy United States marshal, Rooster has attracted the interest of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld, in a terrific film debut), a half-pint who, with her bloodlust and severely braided hair, is an authentic American Gothic. As she listens to Rooster recount his bloody deeds and high body count, her eyes shine with a true believer’s excitement. 
Avenging her father and keeping close track of her family’s expenses are what preoccupy Mattie, a richly conceived and written eccentric, as memorable on the page as she is now on screen. Softened for the first film (in which she was played by a  21-year-old Kim Darby, in a bob), she has been toughed up again by the Coens so that she resembles the seemingly humorless if often unintentionally humorous Scripture-quoting martinet of Mr. Portis’s imagination. At times she brings to mind D. H. Lawrence’s famed formulation that “the essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.” At other times, as when she wears her dead father’s oversize coat and hat, she looks like a foolish child left to perilous play. 
Those dangers are telegraphed early by the public hanging that occurs soon after the story opens. Mattie, along with a family worker, Yarnell (Roy Lee Jones), has traveled from her Yell County home to Fort Smith, Ark., to identify her father, who has been gunned down by another worker, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). After doing so, she sends Yarnell home and gets down to business, first by settling her father’s accounts. She then hires Rooster because she hears that he has “true grit,” a quality that mostly seems to entail a disregard for preserving the lives of his prisoners. It’s no wonder she watches the hanging with such avidity, and no wonder too that she takes off after Chaney, armed with Rooster and her father’s heavy gun. 
Their journey leads them into Indian country (with few Indians) and increasingly tense and violent encounters featuring corpses, severed fingers and a bad, bad man (Barry Pepper, spewing fear and spittle). On occasion a Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who calls himself LaBeef, joins in the search. Wearing jangling spurs and a luxurious mustache that sits on his lip like a spoiled Persian cat, LaBoeuf hopes to bag Chaney for a large reward. Dead or alive, everyone in this story — snaggletooth thief or boardinghouse owner — has a price either on his head or in mind, usually in the form of the dollars and cents one person hopes to extract from another. “Why do you think I am paying you,” Mattie asks Rooster, “if not to have my way?” 
The Coens deliver that line with a touch so light you might not even notice its sting. They have been surprisingly faithful to the tone and idiomatic tang of Mr. Portis’s novel, perhaps because its worldview suits their ironic purposes. The whiskey-soaked Rooster still likes to “pull a cork,” as he does in the book, and the Coens and Mr. Bridges get into the boozy spirit of things with slurs and pratfalls. 
Despite Mr. Bridges’s showy turn, the movie opens and closes with Mattie’s voice-over, which shifts the story away from Rooster and back to her. The Coens also restore the novel’s framing device: “True Grit” isn’t just the story of a gutsy 14-year-old; it is her story as called from the memory of the woman (Elizabeth Marvel) she became. 
The Coens opened their last film, “A Serious Man,” about a 1960s Minneapolis professor  who endures trials worthy of Job, with an enigmatic short story about  a 19th-century tale involving a possible dybbuk. That story is prefaced with a quotation attributed to the medieval Jewish scholar Rashi (“Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you”) that appears in a 19th-century comic story, “The Gilgul, or The Wandering Soul,” about a dybbuk, or restless spirit, that inhabits a person. In “True Grit” the Coens switch to Solomon, opening the film with the first half of Proverbs 28:1  (“The wicked flee when none pursueth”), a line Mattie quotes early in the novel. Like Mr. Portis, they notably omit the second line: “But the righteous are bold as a lion.” 
Mr. Portis’s book hit in 1968, in the midst of a pop-cultural cycle that, partly fueled by the Vietnam war, was revisiting the cowboy myth with degrees of cynicism and nostalgia. “True Grit” sticks to the western template, but with characters who, at least initially, fall far short of the heroic ideal of the type that Wayne himself embodied for decades. Yet no matter how roguish (and laughable) in the novel, Rooster can’t help registering as a larger-than-life hero on screen because the legend who played him, by then a survivor of cancer and countercultural assaults (for the jingoistic “Green Berets”), had played his role for so long. When Wayne won best actor for “True Grit,” it was for playing John Wayne. 
The first “True Grit” opened in New York in early July 1969,  a week after “The Wild Bunch,” the Sam Peckinpah western that’s widely seen as a metaphor about interventionist follies like Vietnam and that remains an enduring evisceration of the genre. The Coens, who like to play with genre, often with giggles and winks, haven’t mounted an assault on the western. But in Mattie they have created a character whose single-minded pursuit of vengeance has unmistakable resonance. In the first “True Grit,”  when Rooster watches Mattie cross a river on horseback, he jocularly says, “She reminds me of me.” The line isn’t in the remake, but from the long, hard look Rooster gives her now, it’s clear that she still does, for better and worse. 
In classic Coen style, the brothers punctuate the image of Mattie riding to dry ground with a cutaway to a slack-jawed Rooster, his mouth agape in wonder. By the time the scene ends, the mood has switched again, and Rooster has drawn his gun on LaBoeuf in deadly seriousness. (Mr. Damon plays the designated clown with grace, as Mr. Bridges slides between buffoonery and malice.) 
In some ways, much like Charles Laughton’s “Night of the Hunter,” which the Coens quote both musically and visually, “True Grit” is a parable about good and evil. Only here, the lines between the two are so blurred as to be indistinguishable, making this a true picture of how the West was won, or — depending on your view — lost. 
“True Grit” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Three severed digits and several holes to the head.

‽
‽Little Fockers‽,‽Apparently, because all the good jokes were used up in the first two “Fockers” movies, the wisenheimers behind the latest installment in this unnecessary trilogy decided to bring in some spew, opening a sick toddler’s mouth like a fire hydrant and letting it rip. 
The mortification of the body has always played a part in the “Fockers” franchise, which hinges on the uneasy, at times violently contentious relationship between a male nurse, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and his father-in-law, Jack (Robert De Niro), a former C.I.A. operative. But at their best and funniest, those mortifications were intrinsic to the story’s meaning. 
Part of what made the first movies work as well as they did — “Meet the Parents” hit in 2000,  and its sequel, “Meet the Fockers,” followed four years later  — was the cultural clash that dare not fully speak its name. Initially, the series only broadly winked at the reasons for Jack’s slow-burning tsuris. Was that a bagel in Greg’s pocket, or was he just glad to see his shiksa girlfriend and then wife, Pam (Teri Polo)? But when the second movie brought in Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman to play Greg’s parents, any residual anxiety about the characters’ nominal cultural differences gave way to the spectacle of two legends playfully batting around the Jewish stereotypes that the stars themselves struggled against and transcended. 
How do you top Ms. Streisand and Mr. Hoffman playing at being the happy, sexy hippie couple for easy jokes? You don’t. Apparently, you don’t even try, as is evident from the new movie’s lack of wit and surplus of lazy scenes. 
Directed by Paul Weitz (Jay Roach did better with the first two), “Little Fockers” reunites all the principal actors, this time to greatly diminished returns in a story that turns on Jack’s decision to anoint Greg the family patriarch. Time is passing, if not quickly enough in this movie, and fears of mortality are nipping at Jack’s heels and clutching at his heart. The ensuing tension — or rather, slackly stitched-together chain of misunderstandings — centers on whether Greg is worthy of this honor. 
Are we there yet? No, because first Jessica Alba has to show up and throw off her clothes and then her body at Mr. Stiller, a story line that has everything to do with his star muscle and nothing to do with Greg. This leads to some matrimonial static that draws the series closer to the kind of deadly dull domestic comedy that the “Fockers” franchise previously managed to avoid becoming. 
Exhaustion partly explains why, though it also seems clear that Mr. Stiller, who in the 10 years since the first “Fockers” has become a Hollywood powerhouse, isn’t interested in being the butt of anyone’s joke. Mr. De Niro might not mind making mincemeat of his own legacy, as a painful bit with a grinning Harvey Keitel suggests. (Somewhere, Martin Scorsese is lighting a votive candle.) But Mr. Stiller is no longer in a laughing mood. 
“Little Fockers” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The usual bodily liquids and penis jokes. 
LITTLE FOCKERS 
Opens on Wednesday  nationwide.  
Directed by Paul Weitz; written by John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey; director of photography, Remi Adefarasin; edited by Greg Hayden, Leslie Jones and Myron Kerstein; music by Stephen Trask; production design by William Arnold; costumes by Molly Maginnis; produced by Jane Rosenthal, Robert De Niro, Jay Roach and Mr. Hamburg; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes. 
WITH: Robert De Niro (Jack Byrnes), Ben Stiller (Greg Focker), Owen Wilson (Kevin Rawley), Blythe Danner (Dina Byrnes), Teri Polo (Pam Focker), Jessica Alba (Andi Garcia), Laura Dern (Prudence), Colin Baiocchi (Henry Focker), Daisy Tahan (Samantha Focker), Dustin Hoffman (Bernie Focker) and Barbra Streisand (Roz Focker). 
‽
‽Yogi Bear‽,‽There’s exactly one thing about the misbegotten big-screen “Yogi Bear” that might make you think back with any fondness to the Hanna-Barbera cartoons on which it’s based. That would be Justin Timberlake’s charming performance as the voice of Boo-Boo Bear, a fitting tribute to the original Boo Boo, Don Messick (who also voiced Scooby-Doo and the Jetsons’ dog, Astro). 
Otherwise this mostly live-action film is a bland 21st-century family comedy without a single moment that captures the wit, energy or sophistication of the original, which by now dates back more than 50 years. After some early picnic-basket stealing, the story expands into a battle to save Jellystone Park from loggers and corrupt politicians, with a romantic subplot involving Ranger Smith and a cute documentary maker. 
We’ve seen this kind of talking-animal ecological parable quite a few times already, and this one is so generic, it wouldn’t pass muster on Saturday-morning television. 
Dan Aykroyd gives a glum and largely personality-free reading of Yogi, while the human actors who signed on to fill the space around the computer-animated bears — including Tom Cavanagh as Ranger Smith, Anna Faris as the environmentally minded filmmaker and Andrew Daly as the nasty mayor — are pretty much helpless. 
It’s especially painful to watch Ms. Faris, so perversely funny in films like “Smiley Face” and “The House Bunny,” reduced to big smiles and false heartiness. 
The director, Eric Brevig, is a visual-effects specialist, and he and his crew have done an excellent job of integrating their animated bears into some majestic scenery (filmed in New Zealand).  
“Yogi Bear” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for jokes about marking territory and scratching backsides.

‽How Do You Know‽,‽In “How Do You Know,” a romantic comedy about missed opportunities, scripted and otherwise, Reese Witherspoon wears an industrial-strength smile and a laser twinkle that looks as if it’s set on kill. Although she’s routinely cast in frothy fare, Ms. Witherspoon comes with a hard, intimidating edge that most directors ignore. Maybe she prefers light and lovely over dark and dangerous. But as she showed in Alexander Payne’s 1999 comedy, “Election,” in which  she played a ferocious high-school climber in a dazzling performance that has hung over her career like an unmet dare, she can be a beautiful menace. 
In “How Do You Know,” an airless, sometimes distressingly mirthless comedy written and directed by James L. Brooks, Ms. Witherspoon plays Lisa, a softball player with world-class   aspirations who fails to make the cut, an unfortunate story line for a movie with the same problem. 
The bad news arrives not long into the movie, furnishing her with a potential existential dilemma — she’s a 31-year-old athlete without obvious prospects — that Mr. Brooks has little interest in exploring. So instead, he dries her tears and piles on the romantic complications, loading her with smiles and sighs, exits and entrances, and cramming this busy yet uneventful movie with the kind of laugh lines built for laugh tracks. 
Lisa’s romantic complications come in two flavors: vanilla and butterscotch. She almost samples the first, a pale, soft-serve businessman working in some vague capacity named George (Paul Rudd), after a mutual friend tries to hook them up. George has his own troubles, including a federal investigation and an overbearing father (an alarmingly unhealthy-looking and wheezing Jack Nicholson) who’s also his boss. 
George is a nice guy, or so the movie insists, again and again. By the time he calls her, Lisa already seems under the spell of Matty (Owen Wilson), a major-league pitcher with lots of dough and a softly cracked attitude toward life. So George strikes out and strikes out  again, though of course not for long. 
As it happens, Mr. Brooks has more predictable taste in men than his female characters do. Albert Brooks’s flop-sweating reporter might have been perfect for Holly Hunter’s motor-mouthed television producer in the filmmaker’s most successful comedy, “Broadcast News,” but it was William Hurt’s dry-look anchor who (temporarily) got the girl. Once again, Mr. Brooks (the filmmaker) tips the scales, mostly because he seems to have mistaken the appealing, featherweight Mr. Rudd for a romantic lead. Mr. Wilson might not have the seriousness (or self-seriousness) of a William Hurt, but he holds your interest with his idiosyncratic, off-rhythm charm and delivery. He’s a live wire, and when he’s onscreen the movie jumps. 
For the most part, though, it just sits there, idling in neutral, as lines are delivered and bodies listlessly moved. The generic quality of the title — yes, indeed, how does anyone know — extends to every other facet in the production. The three main characters talk and talk, save for one dinner of cutely enforced quiet between Lisa and George, and generally sound as if they just got out of therapy: they process rather than converse. Yet perhaps because Mr. Brooks doesn’t want to get too heavy, even when the story lists toward the weighty, much of the dialogue comes in tiny, epigrammatic bites not much bigger and certainly no deeper than the affirmations that Lisa has scribbled on Post-its and stuck on her bathroom mirror. 
“How Do You Know” is so wan and disconnected to anything that feels like real life or, just as good, a screwball interpretation of it that it’s hard to know what Mr. Brooks was really after, other than passing the time with some talented movie people. This lack of urgency and purpose proves toughest on Ms. Witherspoon, who, partly because she’s the strongest or most obviously determined actor in this little group, seems incapable of goofing her way through the movie. Mr. Rudd and Mr. Wilson have no such problem. Curiously, all three are outshone by a pair of character actors — Kathryn Hahn, who plays George’s secretary, Annie, and Lenny Venito, as her boyfriend — who, in an overworked, overwritten hospital scene, show you what love looks like simply by, surprise, good acting. 
“How Do You Know” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some naughty words. 
HOW DO YOU KNOW

Brooks; director of photography, Janusz Kaminski; edited by Richard Marks and Tracey Wadmore-Smith; music by Hans Zimmer; production design by Jeannine Oppewall; costumes by Shay Cunliffe; produced by Mr. Brooks, Julie Ansell, Paula Weinstein and Laurence Mark; released by Columbia Pictures.

‽
‽Mundane History‽,‽Merging astronomy, Buddhist philosophy, and political and social unrest, “Mundane History” may carry a modest title, but its ambitions are exactly the opposite. A simple, almost spare family drama told through strong, purposeful images, this first feature from the Thai director Anocha Suwichakornpong parallels the emotional dynamic of a single home with the tumult of an entire country. 
That home, a sprawling mansion with separate servants’ quarters, is both shelter and prison to Ake (Phakpoom Surapongsanurak), a recently paralyzed young man whose distant father (Paramej Noiam) barely speaks to him. Ake’s care has been entrusted to a diligent male nurse (Arkaney Cherkham) whose gratitude for the job is constantly tested by a patient seething with bitterness and a household whose occupants, he confides to his wife, seem “soulless.” In this airless, patriarchal fief, everyone except Ake knows his or her place. 
Focusing on the quotidian tasks of caregiving — the feeding and bathing, the necessary intimacies — Ms. Suwichakornpong sketches Ake’s gradual reconnection to life with scenes that swerve from prosaic to psychedelic. It’s not always clear what she’s up to (though at least one of her metaphors is screamingly literal), but her visual imagination and grip on atmosphere are consistently impressive. Scarcely less admirable is her ability to depict nongratuitous full-frontal nudity — a talent more than a few of her Hollywood colleagues could stand to learn.

‽
‽The Fighter‽,‽With the possible exception of the romantic comedy, no film genre is more strictly governed by conventions — or enslaved by clichés, if you prefer — than the boxing picture. Something similar might be said about reviews of boxing pictures, so here goes: 
“The Fighter,” directed by David O. Russell and based on the true story of the junior welterweight Micky Ward, is quick on its feet and packs a mighty punch. With solid bodywork, clever feints and tremendous heart, it scores at least a TKO, by which I mean both that it falls just short of overpowering greatness — I can’t quite exclaim, “It’s a knockout!” — and that the most impressive thing about it is technique. 
By the time this film — which was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson, and shepherded into existence by Mark Wahlberg, who plays Mr. Ward — reaches its rousing and brutal final rounds, it may feel a bit familiar. Not necessarily because the story of Mr. Ward’s career is so well known (his most famous bouts, in particular his three extraordinary meetings with Arturo Gatti in 2002 and 2003, do not fall within the movie’s scope), but rather because the shape of the narrative recalls so many other fight movies. This is yet another tale of an underdog battling long odds and stubborn adversity in search of a shot at the big time. 
It is also a love story, a family melodrama and the chronicle of a close and complicated fraternal relationship. The love of a good woman (the unaffectedly lovable Amy Adams), the rivalry and camaraderie between brothers, the battered face, bruised knuckles and wounded pride — “The Fighter” has it all. 
But the inevitable comparisons arise only in retrospect, when it settles down into the company of “Rocky” and “Raging Bull” and other very good (and Best Picture-nominated) boxing pictures. Mr. Russell, a restlessly — sometimes recklessly — inventive filmmaker, does not try to subvert the genre, but rather, as Clint Eastwood did in “Million Dollar Baby,” to refresh it, to find new insights and angles of vision within the parameters of the tried and true. 
Sticking fairly closely to the facts of Mr. Ward’s story, “The Fighter” also plants itself firmly in his native terrain of Lowell, Mass., immersing the viewer, especially in early scenes, in the sensorium of a hard-luck industrial town left to languish in the backwash of globalization. The voices of the citizens are angry, irreverent and profane. The light is flat and unlovely. You can almost smell the weariness and desperation rising off of the tar that Micky, in his day job as a road paver, spreads on streets lined with sagging three-decker houses and faded storefronts. A city with a distinguished place in American labor and literary history — it was the birthplace of Jack Kerouac — Lowell in the early 1990s, when “The Fighter” unfolds, is blighted by poverty, unemployment and the crack epidemic, which has claimed Micky’s half brother, Dicky Eklund, as a casualty. 
This last bit of information emerges piecemeal, through a scrim of family denial and addict  dissembling, but as soon as we see Dicky, played by a gaunt and antic Christian Bale, we know something is wrong. His eyes dart, his mouth draws back into a nervous rictus, and his shuffling, splayed walk conveys neurological damage. Dicky is also amusing, sensitive and quick witted, a ball of comic charm able, just barely, to juggle his addiction with his commitment to his brother and their mother, Alice (Melissa Leo). 
Mr. Bale’s performance is astonishing, in part because he so completely conquers a daunting set of physical and psychological challenges. Dicky is not only an addict but also an athlete in his own right, a former boxer who clings to, and endlessly relives, a single moment of glory. He tells everyone who will listen that he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, and while the facts of the episode are in dispute, his pugilistic skill and intelligence are never in doubt. 
In a crucial scene, having attempted a remarkably stupid caper, he finds himself fleeing the Lowell police, his long limbs flapping like a cartoon character’s as he high-tails it down the street. Then, as Dicky stops and squares off to throw an ill-advised punch, he snaps suddenly from clown to gladiator. You see that his core of talent and discipline has not been completely destroyed by drugs, even if his judgment and self-respect have. You also see that this funny, exasperating character is really a walking, flailing tragedy, for himself and just about everyone around him. 
It is this rhythm — the light, syncopated footwork of comedy setting up stinging jabs of pathos — that makes “The Fighter” so lively, so surprising and so moving. At least since “Flirting With Disaster,” his breakthrough comedy from 1996, Mr. Russell has exhibited a bracingly kinetic directing style, for better and for worse: “Three Kings” flies like a bullet aimed at the contradictions of American global power, while “I Heart Huckabees” spins manically like a hamster’s wheel, blurring its provocative ideas into tiresome intellectual attitudes. 
Mr. Russell came late to “The Fighter,” hired on after other directors had fallen through, and the project seems at once to have unleashed and reined in his extraordinary energies. He and the cast are confident enough to plunge into the richest contradictions and deepest complications of Micky Ward’s life and milieu. (The Ward-Eklund family cooperated with the filmmakers, and one of their friends, Mickey O’Keefe, plays himself on screen.) 
The American working class, in its Northern and Southern Caucasian manifestations, tends to be portrayed in movies either with glib mockery or with an equally condescending solemnity. Micky and Dicky and their clan — seven sisters and that powerhouse of a mother — are vulgar, vicious, loyal, hilarious and a hundred other things, that is, entirely and sometimes embarrassingly human. To say that this family is dysfunctional would be both to understate its troubles and to narrow the film’s scope, which encompasses ethics, sociology and economics as well as psychology. 
Alice, flanked by those seven Fury-like daughters — and occasionally, weakly challenged by her husband (Jack McGee) — stands out in an increasingly crowded field of monstrous movie matriarchs. (See also Mo’Nique in “Precious,” Barbara Hershey in “Black Swan” and Mother Gothel, voiced by Donna Murphy, in “Tangled.”) She and Dicky, her obvious favorite, are supposedly supporting and promoting Micky, but they always seem to undermine his chances for success, which may be their deeper intention. He can never be allowed to surpass his brother, or to think that he’s better than the rest of the family. 
And “The Fighter,” while it persuasively details Micky’s travails in the ring, is more centrally about the fight between Alice and Charlene, his girlfriend, over control of his destiny. Ms. Leo, smoking and raging, as if preparing either to burn Lowell down or kick it to pieces, is a formidable presence, but she is matched by Ms. Adams, whose soft, sweet features disguise a will of steel. The best and hardest punch in a movie full of flying fists is thrown by her. 
Mr. Wahlberg, for his part, leans back against the ropes and watches, underplaying so gracefully and with so little vanity that you almost forget that the movie is supposed to be about Micky. Everyone else seems to do a lot more fighting than the ostensible title character. But the brilliance of Mr. Wahlberg’s quiet performance is that it so effectively mirrors the deep logic of the story, which is finally about the paradox of a man in a violent profession who is fundamentally passive and who must learn how to find some distance from the people who love and need him the most without abandoning them or betraying himself. 
“The Fighter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violent boxing sequences, drug use, obscenity and a bit of sex, though not enough to sap its strength.

‽The Tourist‽,‽It takes a big man to hold the screen level when Angelina Jolie is around — usually the whole thing just tilts in her direction as soon as she struts into the frame. Her partner in crazy-time fame, Brad Pitt, helped keep the balance in “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” their only film together. And now Johnny Depp tries to do much the same in “The Tourist.” Going for muted, eyeliner- and nearly irony-free, he plays an ordinary American who bumbles into a Continental intrigue, which looks like a film you’ve seen before, because you have. 
You know that movie. It’s the one in which Cary Grant and Grace Kelly don’t just travel by train, they also trade knowing looks in the first-class dining car as the waiter fills their glasses, and a shady type secretly takes their photo. The people behind “The Tourist” would like you to flash back to 1955 — as Ms. Jolie’s wardrobe of long gloves suggests  — a risky strategy, given that you actually might. The truth is that it takes an exceptional director to prevent an entertainment as flimsy as this from collapsing under its own weightlessness. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off with Grant and Kelly in “To Catch a Thief,” a bauble that sparkles like a jewel because of the world-class scenery, its stars included, and because of, well, the directing. 
Stargazing is the only reason bonbons like “The Tourist” are made, dreams of box office bonanzas aside. But stars need just the right setting and a director who knows how to make them shine, as Steven Soderbergh does with Mr. Pitt and George Clooney in the “Ocean’s” franchise. The director also needs to hold his own, which, from the generic look and feel of “The Tourist,” clearly wasn’t the case with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. He does put personality into the occasional scene, including a mysterious, hushed interlude in which Ms. Jolie stands with her back to the camera as Mr. Depp creeps up from behind — lover or stalker, you’re not initially sure which — before pulling her close for a hungry kiss. 
It’s a nice idyll among a wash of clichés that include Russian muscle in service to a big meanie, Shaw (Steven Berkoff), whose quest for stolen loot leads him to Elise Ward (Ms. Jolie). A mystery woman of rare ability (she can pick a lock and wear off-the-shoulder gowns), she eludes Shaw while dodging assorted law enforcement agencies, including Scotland Yard, where Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton curl stiff upper lips. Elise pauses long enough to slide into a train seat opposite Frank Tupelo (Mr. Depp), who, after gulping at his good fortune, explains that he’s a vacationing Wisconsin math teacher (as if!). Dinner leads to drinks leads to complications, including hailstorming bullets and a few sluggish boat chases in the Venice canals. 
Hollywood has a long history of collecting (and devouring) European directors, but Mr. von Donnersmarck was an odd choice for froth like this. A few years ago he attracted some attention for “The Lives of Others,” a 2006 drama about an East German couple being spied on by a Stasi officer. Here, his main job seems to have been to find new and flattering ways to shoot Ms. Jolie as she catwalks from Paris to Venice in soaring heels. He tries to invest this adoration with some self-conscious wit, mostly by having all the men in the movie gawp at Elise as if she were as much a supernova as the one playing her. But all this genuflection — she parts one crowd as  Moses does the Red Sea — feels forced rather than mischievous. 
It must be tough for Ms. Jolie to find roles that fit. Off screen she remains a fascinating presence, but on screen she now tends to overwhelm her roles and even her movies. Like every memorable screen star, she still has a face you can get lost in, with its push-pull of hard, jutting angles and well-endowed lips. It’s a face built for extremes, though early on she could also make it work for somewhat smaller, human-scaled roles that were nonetheless tricky for her. Superheroes and superfreaks have long been her truer calling, one reason that “The Tourist” seemed vaguely promising. When she first appears in a come-hither outfit and a small private smile, she looks ready for liftoff. She never ignites, and neither does the movie. 
Mr. Depp doesn’t fare better with a role that forces him to play meek and disappointingly  mild, despite a few screenwriter-supplied tics. (Mr. von Donnersmarck shares writing credit with Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes.) A brilliant character actor and accidental movie star, Mr. Depp has rarely been persuasive playing average. He likes tunneling into his characters, preferably under a thick smear of makeup and flamboyant threads, which is why he’s never made sense in mainstream romance. There’s no place for him to hide with Frank, so he stands around trying to look hapless as Ms. Jolie grabs the lead. There’s definitely some amusement in watching her come to his rescue, a role reversal the movie only flirts with. But oh how much more fun it would have been if Mr. Depp had really played the girl, eyeliner  and all. 
“The Tourist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bloodless violence.

‽
‽The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader‽,‽Not long before the children’s movie “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” sets sail, you might find yourself hoping for a nor’easter to come and blow this latest and perhaps last installment in the screen version of C.S. Lewis’s series, far, far away. But where would it go? Both Never Land and Wonderland are occupied, courtesy of the Walt Disney Company, which helped produce the first “Narnia” movies, the fairly diverting “Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” and the disappointing “Prince Caspian.” Now 20th Century Fox has taken up the franchise with largely dreary results. 
The series has a new director, the generally reliable Michael Apted, who established his rapport with wee ones years ago with “7 Up!,” the first in a documentary series that has revisited the same group of British men and women in new movies every seven years since 1964, when the participants were squirmy 7-year-olds. Though Mr. Apted brings a few minor idiosyncrasies to “Dawn Treader” — notably with his riskily off-putting direction of the young actor Will Poulter, a “Narnia” newcomer — a strong filmmaking voice was clearly not called for in an entertainment that has been carefully calibrated for maximum blandness. Mr. Apted is aboard to keep the franchise sailing along or at least afloat, which he does. 
Mr. Poulter is by far the most unexpected ingredient in the new adventure, primarily because his aggressive, chatterbox performance digs under your skin, which, as it turns out, is what makes it finally work. First seen in the independent film “Son of Rambow,” Mr. Poulter here plays Eustace Scrubb, a cousin of Lucy and Edmund Pevensie (Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes), who, with their brother Peter and sister Susan discovered Narnia. Three books and several years later, Britain is still at war, and Lucy and Edmund are squirreled away with Eustace’s family, to his loquacious displeasure. As he greedily hoards his sweets and mutters invectives, you can see the next Mike Leigh misanthrope being born before your eyes. 
He keeps up the grumbling even after a maritime painting on a wall turns into a Niagara Falls, flooding a bedroom with imaginative computer-generated water and sweeping him, Lucy and Edmund out to sea. They’re soon rescued by their old comrade in arms, King Caspian (Ben Barnes), who is manning the Dawn Treader with a squeaky clean crew of men and talking beasts, including an armed (and tailed) mouse-kateer, Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg). Backslapping and strained comic bits ensue, including a sword fight between a disbelieving Eustace and Reepicheep, a kind of furry Jiminy Cricket but without the mellifluous pipes. The ship makes a few pit stops on enchanted islands, amid boatloads of exposition, which reinforce the sense that it’s a long way before the series will drop anchor. 
It remains to be seen whether we’ll get there — there are four more books — though it would help if a better balance were struck between the actors, most of whom could use a firmer hand, and the special effects. (This one comes in 3-D, a wasted effort.) Though there are times when the movie turns into a congested mess, as in a climactic battle that washes the screen in gray, there are moments when you also see a quieter, less industrial production. Such is the case after Eustace is turned into a grand, ungainly, unhappy dragon. When he lies forlornly on a beach, or as forlornly as dragons do, and a monstrous-size tear slides down his scaly face, you don’t just see the wizardry magic, you also see the human touch behind it. 
“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” is rated PG. Parental guidance suggested but not essential. 
THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA 
The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 
Opens on Friday  nationwide.  
Directed by Michael Apted; written by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Michael Petroni, based on the book by C. S. Lewis; director of photography, Dante Spinotti; edited by Rick Shaine; music by David Arnold; production design by Barry Robison; costumes by Isis Mussenden; produced by Mark Johnson, Andrew Adamson and Philip Steuer; released by Fox 2000  Pictures and Walden Media. Running time: 1 hour 55 minutes. 
WITH: Georgie Henley (Lucy Pevensie), Skandar Keynes (Edmund Pevensie), Ben Barnes (Caspian), Will Poulter (Eustace Scrubb), Liam Neeson (Voice of Aslan), Simon Pegg (Voice of Reepicheep) and Tilda Swinton (The White Witch). 
‽
‽The Warrior's Way‽,‽There are a lot of different movies jostling for our attention inside “The Warrior’s Way.” In terms of formula, it resembles the chop suey western “Shanghai Noon”: an Asian princess and her protector are transported to the Wild West, where they’re pursued by Americans with guns and Asians with swords. Jackie Chan has been replaced by the  Korean star Jang Dong Gun, and Lucy Liu by a remarkably composed toddler named Analin Rudd. 
On a conceptual level “The Warrior’s Way” is something altogether different and more self-conscious. Set in a fantastical ghost town with a resident circus troupe and filmed on studio sets, it looks like a Sergio Leone epic as staged by Fellini, or by Lars von Trier. The genre-mashing makes sense, given the résumé of the writer and director, Sngmoo Lee, who has a master’s degree in cinema studies from New York University and helped found the film department at the Korean National University of Arts. 
The best way to understand the film, though, is in commercial terms: as an attempt to use Mr. Jang to cash in on the audience that has come out for crossover action hits starring Mr. Chan and Jet Li. Mr. Jang has presence and a movie-star face, but he’s a latecomer to martial arts and swordplay; following a typical South   Korean path, he started out in soap operas and moved into crime and war movies, building a distinguished (and highly profitable) filmography that includes the great action-crime drama “Nowhere to Hide.” 
Generalizing brutally, you could argue that Hong Kong movies require actors trained to be fluid and funny, while South   Korean movies like their male characters stiff and stern, and Mr. Jang doesn’t make the same kind of impression in “The Warrior’s Way” that his Hong Kong counterparts have in their American movies. The film also muffles him by keeping his dialogue to a minimum (even though his English is perfectly acceptable), filling the space with Geoffrey Rush’s narration and the chattering of Kate Bosworth’s logorrheic female sidekick. 
Mr. Jang is not the problem with “The Warrior’s Way,” however. That would be Mr. Lee’s screenplay, a thin and unconvincing gruel of western clichés, martial arts action and forced comedy that wouldn’t make the grade in the graphic novels that have clearly helped form his vision. 
Ms. Bosworth, the phlegmatic Mr. Jang and a ragged, occasionally amusing Mr. Rush  — the good, the sad and the ugly  — face off against a cartoonish brigand (Danny Huston, admirably restrained) and phalanxes of hooded swordsmen led by the usual mystical Chinese warrior (Ti Lung, ditto). The sometimes impressive visual effects make these battles entertaining, in a mindless way, but it’s impossible to work up any feeling about them. The only thing supplying that is the occasional laugh, pout or gurgle by Ms. Rudd. 
“The Warrior’s Way” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for increasingly intense comic-book violence.

‽
‽Black Swan‽,‽A witchy brew of madness and cunning, “Black Swan” tells the story of a ballerina who aches, with battered feet and an increasingly crowded head, to break out of the corps. Played by Natalie Portman in a smashing, bruising, wholly committed performance, the young dancer, Nina, looks more like a child than a woman, her flesh as undernourished as her mind. When she goes to bed at night, a nearby jewelry box tinkling “Swan Lake,” a crowd of stuffed animals watches over her, longtime companions that — as Nina and this dementedly entertaining film grow more unhinged — begin to look more like jailers than friends. 
Crammed with twins — lookalikes, mirrored images, doppelgängers — the story follows that of the “Swan Lake” ballet in broad, gradually warped strokes. It opens with the artistic director of a fictional New York ballet company, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), announcing that the new season will begin with a “visceral and real” version of that old favorite. To that end he dumps his prima ballerina, Beth  (Winona Ryder), and picks Nina to dance the dual role of the swan queen (an enchanted woman in bird form) and her villainous black twin. But as the pressure builds, things fall apart, or Nina does. She stumbles out of a spin and begins scratching at her skin. One day she strips a piece from her finger as lightly as if she were peeling a banana. 
Part tortured-artist drama, “Black Swan” looks like a tony art-house entertainment. (Hey, there’s Lincoln Center!) But what gives it a jolt is its giddy, sometimes sleazy exploitation-cinema savvy. The director Darren Aronofsky is a well-schooled cinéaste, and in “Black Swan” he riffs on Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s ballet masterpiece, “The Red Shoes,” and the pair’s “Black Narcissus,” among other influences. But it’s also likely that Mr. Aronofsky, who was born in 1969 and grew up in Brooklyn, frequented Times Square when it was known as the deuce and lined with movie palaces playing the best and worst in trash cinema. I bet he also caught a few episodes of the “Red Shoe Diaries” on cable. 
That isn’t a knock. One of the pleasures of “Black Swan” is its lack of reverence toward the rarefied world of ballet, which to  outsiders can look as lively as a crypt. Mr. Aronofsky makes this world (or his version of it) exciting partly by pulling back the velvet curtains and showing you the sacrifices and crushingly hard work that goes into creating beautiful dances. Nina doesn’t just pirouette prettily, she also cracks her damaged toes (the sound design picking up every crackle and crunch) and sticks her fingers down her throat to vomit up her food. Mostly, though, she trains hard, hammering her toe shoes into floor much as Jake La Motta  pounded his fists into flesh. She’s a contender, but also a martyr to her art. 
Mr. Aronofsky is happy to see her bleed. A filmmaker who likes to play around with genre while mixing the highbrow with the lowdown and dirty, he has built a small, vivid catalog by exploring human extremes with wildly uneven degrees of visual wow, sensitivity and intelligence. He trawled the lower depths in “Requiem for a Dream” and struggled to scale the metaphysical heights with “The Fountain,” a fable about eternal (as in, when will it end?) love. For his previous  movie, “The Wrestler,” he proved his commercial smarts by taking Mickey Rourke out of deep freeze and dusting off a comeback story that was old when Wallace Beery wiped Jackie Cooper’s runny nose with the script for “The Champ.” 
“Black Swan,” by contrast, surprises despite its lusty or rather sluttish predilection for clichés, which include the requisitely demanding impresario (Mr. Cassel makes a model cock of the walk) and Nina’s ballerina rival, Lily (Mila Kunis, as a succulent, borderline rancid peach). But, oh, what Mr. Aronofsky does with those clichés, which he embraces, exploits and, by a squeak, finally transcends. 
Such is his faith in his ability to surmount the obvious (and the lethally blunt) that he turns Nina’s mother, Erica (a terrific Barbara Hershey), into a smother-mother who out-crazies Faye Dunaway’s Joan Crawford in the mommy dearest department. You don’t know whether to laugh or shriek (both are reasonable responses),     and it is this  uncertainty and at times delicious unease that proves to be Mr. Aronofsky’s sweet spot. 
It’s easy to read “Black Swan” as a  gloss on the artistic pursuit of the ideal. But take another  look, and you see that Mr. Aronofsky is simultaneously telling that story straight, playing with the suffering-artist stereotype and having his nasty way with Nina, burdening her with trippy psychodrama and letting her run wild in a sexcapade  that will soon be in heavy rotation on the Web. The screenplay, by  Mark Heyman, Andrés Heinz and John McLaughlin, invites pop-psychological interpretations about women who self-mutilate while striving for their perfect selves, a description that seems to fit Nina. But such a reading only flattens a film that from scene to scene is deadly serious, downright goofy and by turns shocking, funny and touching. 
With “Black Swan” Mr. Aronofsky has found a surprisingly accommodating vehicle for his preoccupations, including bodies in pain, and his ever more refined technique. Here, working with his usual cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, and largely shooting hand-held in both super-16-millimeter film and digital, Mr. Aronofsky opts for grit over gloss, an ideal strategy for a story with a harsh underbelly. Hand-held cinematography can be lazy shorthand for “reality” (as if life happens in shaky-cam), but here the hand-held visuals work because of their intimacy. The influence of the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne can be seen in the close, tag-along shots of Nina’s head as she hurries off, a point of view that brings you within breathing, at times panting, distance of a character whose behavior can be off-putting. 
Though it had its moments, “The Wrestler” felt like the work of a director who, after proving his street   bona fides and bombing at the box office, decided to try some pandering. It worked: Mr. Rourke was rediscovered, and Mr. Aronofsky’s future was salvaged, in part because he had closed the distance between the fallen star played by Mr. Rourke and the one he himself had become. Ms. Portman’s performance in “Black Swan” is more art than autobiography, and as a consequence more honest, but because it’s so demandingly physical the lines that usually divide actresses from their characters are also blurred. This is, after all, Ms. Portman’s own thin body on display, her jutting chest bones as sharply defined as a picket fence. 
Although Mr. Aronofsky focuses on her head, shoulders and arms, mostly avoiding long shots that might betray a lack of technique, Ms. Portman does most of her own dancing (and plausibly, at least to this ballet naïf). The vision of Ms. Portman’s own body straining with so much tremulous, tremendous  effort, her pale arms fluttering in desperation, grounds the story in the real, as do the totemic Lincoln Center buildings, the clattering subway and the grubby, claustrophobic apartment Nina shares with her mother. Together they create the solid foundation of truth that makes the slow-creeping hallucinatory flights of fantasy all the more jolting and powerful. Much like the new version of “Swan Lake” that Thomas creates, “Black Swan” is visceral and real even while it’s one delirious, phantasmagoric freakout. 
“Black Swan” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bedroom gymnastics  and graphic violence.  
BLACK SWAN 
Opens on Friday  in New York, Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Plano, Tex., San Franciso, Washington and Los Angeles.  
Directed by Darren Aronofsky; written by Mark Heyman, Andrés Heinz and John McLaughlin, based on a story by Mr. Heinz; director of photography, Matthew Libatique; edited by Andrew Weisblum; music by Clint Mansell; ballet choreography by Benjamin Millepied; production design by Thérèse DePrez; costumes by Amy Westcott, ballet costumes by Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte; produced by Mike Medavoy, Arnold W. Messer, Brian Oliver and Scott Franklin; released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.

‽
‽Hollywood to Dollywood‽,‽The optimism and good humor of John Lavin’s crude, endearing documentary “Hollywood to Dollywood” are so unquenchable that its disturbing underlying theme — growing up gay in the South is no picnic — is partly obscured by its openheartedness. The subjects, Gary and Larry Lane, are gay identical twins in their mid-30s from a Southern Baptist background who grew up in a small North Carolina town and moved to Los Angeles a decade ago. 
The film follows them on a road trip in an RV named Jolene from Southern California to Dollywood, the Pigeon Forge, Tenn., theme park whose namesake is the twins’ idol, Dolly Parton. As part of a celebration of the park’s 25th anniversary, Ms. Parton is scheduled to perform there and appear in a parade. During the festivities they hope to hand her a screenplay they have been working on for five years, with a role written for her. 
Talk about diva worship! To the Lane brothers, Ms. Parton looms as more than a glamorous star from humble Southern roots. She is a virtual saint, whose common-sense wisdom and compassion are inspirations. 
The brothers’ stories of rejection by their mother would be heartbreaking and infuriating if related by less resilient people. But perhaps because they have each other, as well as long-term boyfriends — Gary’s partner, Mike Bowen, travels with them — they are more saddened than devastated. 
The brothers came out to each other when they were 16. They were 25 when they told their mother; Larry remembers her asking him to put his hand on a Bible and swear he wasn’t gay. He refused, and she later fell apart. Even now, the brothers say, residents of their hometown don’t know about their sexuality. 
As they make their way through northern Texas in tornado weather to Nashville, which is still recovering from a catastrophic flood, they tell their stories, visit friends and chat about Ms. Parton with everyone they meet. You realize the degree to which Ms. Parton, a Tennessee mountain native, now 66, is a folk heroine to people throughout the South. Larding the film are excerpts from 15 Dolly Parton songs and clips of her television appearances, including fragments of a 2010 interview with Larry King. 
You have to admire a beloved entertainer who declares, with apparent sincerity, “I have more guts than talent.” 
‽
‽Sacrifice‽,‽Vengeance takes time — and no end of lurid plotting — in “Sacrifice,” Chen Kaige’s soapy, sentimental epic about political ambition and paternal love. 
Based on the Yuan dynasty play “Orphan of Zhao,” the story centers on Chen Ying (Ge You), a humble court doctor who, at great personal cost, saves the life of the newborn heir to the throne when the child’s family is massacred in a coup led by the deadeyed Gen. Tu Angu (Wang Xue-qi). Over the next 15 years Chen will raise the boy as his own, naming him Bo and wangling both of them into the palace of the usurper, who unwittingly agrees to become Bo’s godfather. Torn between two dads — one rich and magnanimous, the other servile and smotheringly strict — poor Bo is as ignorant of his heritage as of Chen’s plan to use him as his avenger. 
Given that the important female characters are swiftly dispatched early on, this is a film heavy with the desires of men who appear to have no interest in, or access to, sex. (A concubine or two would have brightened things up considerably.) And though the initial coup is staged with wit as well as blood — did you know you could overthrow a ruler with a mosquito, a mad dog and a strategically placed tripwire? — Mr. Chen’s direction feels more ponderous than usual. Perhaps it’s all that armor, or that even the estimable Mr. Wang seems exhausted by the film’s dolorous themes, but it’s tough to care about characters who spend most of their lives obsessing over the violent deaths of others. 
“Sacrifice” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A cheek is slashed, a bunny killed and a horse’s eye swallowed whole. 
‽
‽The City Dark‽,‽A documentary about light pollution that is entertaining and thought-provoking? It hardly seems possible, but that’s what Ian Cheney has made in “The City Dark.” 
Mr. Cheney’s film is a personal lament for the star-filled night sky he experienced growing up in Maine, but it is neither sorrowful nor a rant; he somehow manages to give this engaging work a sense of humor. He also manages to make it smart, avoiding traps that might have snared other documentarians, like merely regurgitating the details of some local dispute over electronic signs or stadium lighting. 
Instead he and the people he interviews explore what our increasing inability to see the night sky means for us philosophically. 
“Seeing the universe around us tells us about our own part of the universe,” says Jeffrey R. Kuhn, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii, “and to close that door, I think, would change the character of humankind entirely.” 
Mr. Cheney reminds us of just how recent the phenomenon of an illuminated night is. Until a comparatively few generations ago, a campfire was the only noncelestial thing intruding on the daily darkness. Now, of course, our most inhabited places essentially have no night, and whatever human rhythms were tied to the natural cycle of light and dark may have been disrupted. 
Mr. Cheney is interested in more than the airy spiritual consequences of this. He also explores what it might be doing to health, noting studies involving night-shift workers and cancer. 
Other species are affected as well. Perhaps the film’s most poignant footage is of newly hatched sea turtles in Florida that are confused about where the ocean is because of lights around the nesting grounds. 
“When we add light to the environment,” says Chad Moore, the leader of a National Park Service team studying the issue, “that has the potential to disrupt habitat, just like running a bulldozer over the landscape can. Darkness is a necessary habitat for nocturnal animals.” 
Mr. Cheney looks at a few attempts to use alternative lighting, including in the High Line park in Manhattan, but all in all, darkness seems to be fighting a losing battle. This film makes you want to go find a starry sky to camp under quickly, before it’s all gone. 
‽
‽Angels Crest‽,‽The small, hardy community in the Rocky Mountains that gives “Angels Crest” its name is a rough-hewn working-class town of grain elevators and meat-and-potatoes eateries where everyone knows everyone else’s business. Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekker), the film’s main character, is a 21-year-old father who works in an auto parts shop and is raising his 3-year-old son, Nate, singlehandedly. The child’s mother, Cindy (Lynn Collins), a bitter and promiscuous alcoholic much older than Ethan, keeps her distance. 
Tragedy strikes early, when Ethan packs Nate into his pickup truck and drives into the woods to hunt. After parking on the side of the road, he buckles his son into his child seat, turns up the heat and leaves Nate alone while he stalks deer. When Ethan returns, Nate has disappeared, and he panics. A frantic search ensues, with teams of men combing the woods. Even after the search is abandoned, Ethan continues looking for the boy, whom he eventually discovers frozen to death. 
“Angels Crest,” directed by Gaby Dellal, is a sustained howl of grief in which Ethan’s unassailable sorrow and guilt send an arrow into your heart. In these scenes the screenplay, adapted by Catherine Trieschmann from a novel by Leslie Schwartz, captures the same excruciating pain beyond words that Atom Egoyan distilled in his adaptation of “The Sweet Hereafter” by Russell Banks. That film, about a small town’s trauma after many of its children die in a school bus accident, had more concentrated grief than any film I can recall. 
But the other parts of “Angels Crest” mostly don’t fit. Although the movie captures the solidarity and the beauty and peril of a rustic mountain town whose residents are necessarily interdependent, its individual subplots don’t connect. Despite several solid performances, the characters are too hazily sketched and too loosely linked to form a meaningful chain. 
Ms. Collins as the absentee mother, who in a rage tries to run down Ethan in her car, is a self-pitying, one-dimensional nightmare. A story line involving Cindy’s relationship with her devout mother (Barbara Williams) tries and fails to humanize her. When Cindy snaps at her mother, “You have your god; I have mine,” a reference to booze, all you feel is disgust. 
Another subplot involving Ethan’s best friend, Rusty (Joseph Morgan), who was sleeping with Cindy when the tragedy occurred, is left undeveloped. A strand that follows Ethan’s friend Jane (Elizabeth McGovern), a lesbian waitress at the diner that is a kind of clearinghouse for the film’s characters, drifts aimlessly. Nate’s death makes Jane uncomfortably aware of her own troubled history as a parent. (Her grown son shows up with his pregnant girlfriend.) The incident also fortifies the bond between the diner’s proprietor, Angie (Mira Sorvino), another undeveloped character, and her young daughter. 
Most out of place is Jeremy Piven as Jack, a local district attorney, with his own tragic baggage that (frustratingly) is alluded to but never specified. Jack, who seeks to prosecute Ethan for criminally negligent homicide, methodically interviews the townspeople, whom he finds to be divided over Ethan’s culpability. 
All of this adds up to much ado about much less than meets the eye. Situations that could illuminate merely distract. And the abrupt, melodramatic conclusion feels unearned. Despite its earnest and frostbitten atmosphere, “Angels Crest” is a film of sadly missed opportunities. 
“Angels Crest” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and strong language.

‽
‽The Darkest Hour‽,‽Based on the admittedly flimsy evidence of films like “The Darkest Hour,” the best defense against invading aliens is to be as attractive as possible. Being one-dimensional doesn’t hurt, either, even if that particular character flaw can be safely blamed on whoever is responsible for the screenplay — in this case, Jon Spaihts. Given that he is also one of two writers credited on Ridley Scott’s much anticipated 2012 film (and possible “Alien” prequel) “Prometheus,” it is to be hoped that his lazy ideas were not equally apportioned between the two projects. 
Because, really, how slovenly is it to use invisible aliens? If you’re going to tease us with nothing but pinwheels of light for three-quarters of the film, you’d better have one heck of a reveal up your sleeve. But if all you have is the equivalent of exploding garden gnomes, then your problems are greater than a disposable cast and a filming style as flat as the color palette. As one cement-gray scene follows another, audiences may find themselves rooting for the aliens, if only because their sparkly cloaking devices at least offer visual stimulation. 
Working from a story that has been knocking around for years, Mr. Spaihts and his director, Chris Gorak, send two Internet entrepreneurs (Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella) to Moscow to finish a business deal. When they learn that a Swedish opportunist (Joel Kinnaman) has stolen their idea, our lads head to a nightclub to lick their wounds and distract themselves with perky female tourists (namely Olivia Thirlby and Rachael Taylor). There the four — and the scheming Swede — will remain for the next few days as fireballs from outer space transform most of humanity into untidy piles of cremains. 
While we wait for the core cast to be reduced to the requisite breeding pair, we have time to ponder the pointlessness of the Moscow setting, chosen primarily to allow the filmmakers access to stock Russian characters — like the crazy inventor and the band of armed-to-the-teeth partisans — and exotic architecture. 
“The audience will enjoy it and will feel it’s something new,” Timur Bekmambetov, one of the film’s producers, assures us in the publicity notes, but I wouldn’t be so confident. The audience is more likely to be wondering why Mr. Bekmambetov, the sometimes inspired mind behind the supernatural pictures “Night Watch” and its sequel, “Day Watch,” proved unable to inject life into this one. 
Also a mystery is the apparent evaporation of Mr. Gorak’s freshman promise. When, in 2006, he wrote and directed the electrifying no-budget thriller “Right at Your Door,” you wondered what he might accomplish with more cash and greater resources. Now we know: despite a title grandiosely borrowed from Winston Churchill, “The Darkest Hour” is yet another depressing failure of imagination. Even with a technological gold mine at his disposal, all Mr. Gorak can conceive of is destruction. 
“The Darkest Hour” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Humans are atomized, and panties are flashed.

‽
‽War Horse‽,‽There is no combat in the early scenes of “War Horse,” Steven Spielberg’s sweeping adaptation of the popular stage spectacle, but the film opens with a cinematic assault as audacious and unsparing as the Normandy landing in “Saving Private Ryan.” With widescreen, pastoral vistas dappled in golden sunlight and washed in music (by John Williams) that is somehow both grand and folksy, Mr. Spielberg lays siege to your cynicism, bombarding you with strong and simple appeals to feeling. 
You may find yourself resisting this sentimental pageant of early-20th-century rural English life, replete with verdant fields, muddy tweeds and damp turnips, but my strong advice is to surrender. Allow your sped-up, modern, movie-going metabolism, accelerated by a diet of frantic digital confections — including Mr. Spielberg’s just-released “Adventures of Tintin” — to calm down a bit. Suppress your instinctive impatience, quiet the snarky voice in your head and allow yourself to recall, or perhaps to discover, the deep pleasures of sincerity. 
If you can fake that, the old Hollywood adage goes, you’ve got it made. But while “War Horse” is, like so many of Mr. Spielberg’s films, a work of supreme artifice, it is also a self-conscious attempt to revive and pay tribute to a glorious tradition of honest, emotionally direct storytelling. Shot the old-fashioned way, on actual film stock (the cinematographer is Mr. Spielberg’s frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski), the picture has a dark, velvety luster capable of imparting a measure of movie-palace magic to the impersonal cavern of your local multiplex. An Interview With the “War Horse” Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski 
The story, in its early chapters, also takes you back to an older — you may well say cornier — style of entertainment. Joey, the fleet-footed, headstrong half-Thoroughbred of the title, is purchased at auction by Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), a proud and grouchy Devon farmer with a tendency to drink too much. His household includes a loving, scolding wife, Rosie (Emily Watson); a cantankerous goose; and a strapping lad named Albert (Jeremy Irvine), who forms an immediate and unbreakable bond with Joey. The teenage boy trains the horse to pull a plow and together they ride through the stunning scenery. 
But this pastoral is darkened by memories of war — Ted fought the Boers in South Africa, an experience so terrible he cannot speak of it to his son — and by social divisions. The Narracotts are tenant farmers at the mercy of their landlord (David Thewlis), and if “War Horse” pays tribute to solid British virtues of decency and discipline it also, like a Thomas Hardy novel, exposes the snobbery and economic oppression that are, if anything, even more deeply rooted in that nation’s history. 
So it is not entirely a simpler, more innocent world that is swept away by the war but rather a way of life whose contradictions are as emphatically presented as its charms. And what follows, as Joey is taken across the English Channel to the battlefields and trenches of Flanders and France, is a nightmare of cruelty that is not without its own sinister magic. Like most movies with an antiwar message, “War Horse” cannot help but be enthralled by the epic scale and transformative power of military conflict. “The war has taken everything from everyone” — the truth of this reckoning, uttered more than once by characters on screen, is self-evident, but it is complicated by the visceral charge and cathartic relief that an effective war movie gives to its audience. 
The extreme violence of the slaughter in World War I is implied rather than graphically depicted. Mr. Spielberg steps back from the bloody, chaotic naturalism of “Saving Private Ryan” — this is an animal fable for children, after all, with echoes of “E. T.” and Carroll Ballard’s “Black Stallion” — but his ability to infuse action sequences with emotional gravity has hardly diminished. 
An early battle scene dramatizes the modernization of warfare with remarkable and haunting efficiency. A British cavalry unit attacks a German encampment, charging through the enemy ranks with swords in what appears to be a clean and devastating rout. But then, at the edge of the field, the German machine guns begin to fire, and the British horses crash into the forest, suddenly riderless and instantly obsolete. Joey, who of course never sought out heroism in the first place, is relegated to a life of brutal labor that seems fated to end in an ignoble death. 
He is kept alive by instinct, human kindness and the companionship of a regal black horse named Topthorn. Joey’s episodic journey takes him from British to German hands and back again, with a sojourn on a French farm owned by an elderly jam-maker (Niels Arestrup) and his young granddaughter (Celine Buckens). 
Albert, meanwhile, makes his own way to the war, and his and Joey’s parallel experiences — harrowing escapes, the loss of friends, the terror and deprivation brightened by flickers of tenderness or high spirits — give the story texture and momentum, as well as giving Mr. Spielberg an opportunity to show off, once again, his unmatched skill at cross-cutting. (The large cast, mostly British and almost entirely male, acquits itself admirably, with a few moments of maudlin overacting and many more of heartbreaking understatement.) 
Mr. Spielberg and the screenwriters, Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, have wisely avoided attempting to reproduce the atmosphere and effects of the stage production, in which Joey and the other horses are portrayed by huge puppets. He prefers to translate the tale, which originates in a novel by Michael Morpurgo, into a fully cinematic idiom. And “War Horse” turns out to have a central Spielbergian theme — perhaps the dominant idea in this director’s body of work — namely the fraught and fascinating relationship between the human and the nonhuman. An Interview With Steven Spielberg 
What do they — sharks, horses, aliens, dinosaurs, intelligent machines — mean to us? What are we supposed to do with them? The boundary can be hard to maintain: sometimes, as in “E. T.” and “A. I.,” nonhuman beings are virtually impossible to distinguish from humans; at other times, as in “Amistad” and “Schindler’s List,” self-evidently human beings are denied that status. Sometimes the nonhuman is a threat, at other times a comfort, but it always presents a profound ethical challenge based in a stark existential mystery: Who are we? 
Mr. Spielberg’s answers to this question tend to be hopeful, and his taste for happy, or at least redemptive endings is frequently criticized. But his ruthless optimism, while it has helped to make him an enormously successful showman, is also crucial to his identity as an artist, and is more complicated than many of his detractors realize. “War Horse” registers the loss and horror of a gruesomely irrational episode in history, a convulsion that can still seem like an invitation to despair. To refuse that, to choose compassion and consolation, requires a measure of obstinacy, a muscular and brutish willfulness that is also an authentic kind of grace. 
“War Horse” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The violence is intense and upsetting, though not especially gory by present-day standards.

‽
‽We Bought a Zoo‽,‽Cameron Crowe may be the last of the Hollywood romantics. He’s best known for his stories about love and longing, for films that immortalize the moment when characters bare their hearts, as when John Cusack serenades a girl with a boom box in “Say Anything” and Renée Zellweger tells Tom Cruise he had her at hello in “Jerry Maguire.” These are images of such excruciating sincerity that they invite, almost demand cynicism. Yet it’s their openness that makes them work. And while his films depend on the familiar image of the couple in love, these are relationships that exist within a larger tribe, a band, a family and now, with “We Bought a Zoo,” a menagerie. 
What Mr. Crowe’s films also share is his delicate touch with actors. Ms. Zellweger has never been better than in “Jerry Maguire,” which found both Mr. Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. at their most appealing. Matt Damon, the star of “We Bought a Zoo,” is a stronger actor than those with whom Mr. Crowe often works, and the combination might initially seem off. Mr. Crowe leans toward lightness while Mr. Damon, who can do glib as well as the next star, likes to roam around in the shadows, so that even his comedies carry a sting (as with “The Informant!”). But this seriousness, which complicates his boyishness with pathos, gives ballast to a movie that might have drifted along on charm. 
When “We Bought a Zoo” opens, his character, Benjamin Mee, is struggling to hold on to his family and his Los Angeles journalism career after the recent death of his wife, Katherine (Stephanie Szostak). Benjamin has yet to get a grip on being a single parent to 14-year-old Dylan (Colin Ford) and 7-year-old Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones, a natural), but he seems strangely at ease, whether he’s fumbling with school lunches or warding off predatory moms bearing trays of condolence lasagna. He’s so self-assured that when his editor doesn’t respond to his story pitches, Benjamin just up and quits with a smile. 
The confidence with which Benjamin breezes out the door (in a job-shedding profession like journalism, no less) immediately signals that you’re not in Kansas anymore, or anywhere resembling the real world. He rationalizes that it’s for the good of his children, who are the same two reasons most people would cling to their jobs. 
In classic movie logic, he doesn’t agonize about how he’ll keep his children housed, fed and clothed; he doesn’t even scramble for new work. Instead, he sells their home and buys a picturesquely dilapidated house with mountain views that not only comes with a lion, tigers and bears, but also a lovely zookeeper, Kelly Foster (an appealing Scarlett Johansson). The zoo, to judge by the shy glances, is more of an ark. 
There are complications, though this being a Cameron Crowe movie they’re soon worked out. The zoo, having fallen into disrepair, has been closed and is being kept going by the sheer good will of employees like Kelly. Benjamin starts writing checks and, with the help of the staff (the cast includes Patrick Fugit and Angus Macfadyen), the zoo squeaks and roars back into shape. The enclosures are repaired and expanded, the bills and employees paid. Little Rosie takes to her new home swimmingly even as Dylan sulks and stomps about, initially unreceptive to Kelly’s attentive cousin, Lily (Elle Fanning). Benjamin, meanwhile, continues to keep it together, his facade of confidence occasionally dinged by a bit of slapstick, child trouble and some palpably anguished nights. 
“We Bought a Zoo” is based on a nonfiction book of the same title that chronicles how the British journalist Benjamin Mee together with his family bought a closed zoo that they rehabilitated, renamed and reopened in 2007. Mr. Mee’s mother, Amelia, was in on the family’s grand adventure as was Mr. Mee’s wife, Katherine, who died shortly after. In the movie, the brutality of illness and death remains safely off-screen when it comes to people and animals alike. Instead, Mr. Crowe makes the escalating tension between Benjamin and Dylan the story’s soft center — a miscalculation. Dylan’s petulance registers as generically adolescent rather than anguished, and his company wears thin, partly because Benjamin’s doesn’t. 
The creaks, groans and clichés of the screenplay, which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (“27 Dresses”) and reworked by Mr. Crowe are, however, finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers, those with two legs and more, and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role. Mr. Crowe doesn’t linger over Benjamin’s despondency. 
Rather, he gives it gentle due in passages that remind you that there’s often a strain of melancholia in this director’s work, a sadness that suggests that Mr. Crowe intimately knows the darkness and uses his movies as a way to resist (or deny) it. Whatever the case, you may not buy his happy endings, but it’s a seductive ideal when all of God’s creatures, great and small, buxom and blond, exist in such harmony. 
“We Bought a Zoo” is rated PG. (Parental guidance suggested.) A dead mother and a dying animal.

B. Smoove (Mr. Stevens). 
‽
‽The Adventures of Tintin‽,‽Before Indiana Jones cracked his bullwhip for some old-fashioned Hollywood fun, Tintin circled the globe in the name of European divertissement. The pen-and-ink creation of the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (1907-83), known better as Hergé, Tintin is the charming boy reporter and adventurer who, with his white fox terrier Snowy close at heel, has traveled the world since 1929 in action-packed yarns with titles like “Cigars of the Pharaoh.” It was only a matter of time before Tintin went Hollywood. And, yowza, has he hit it big and hard in “The Adventures of Tintin,” a marvel of gee-wizardry and a night’s entertainment that can feel like a lifetime. 
What took him so long? Certainly Tintin comes with many of the prerequisites for big-screen exploits, including pluck, ingenuity, derring-do, exotic locales, and a ready-made team of friends and foes. Many of these are busily at play in “The Adventures of Tintin,” an animated boy’s own adventure directed by Steven Spielberg, that eternal Hollywood boy wonder. Almost wholly cooked up in a computer and using motion-capture technology, it turns on a riddle that takes the story from sea to desert and other landlubbing destinations, including an imaginary Moroccan city, Bagghar (a play on a French word for brawl, bagarre), which looks as canned as a sand-strewn set for a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road movie if tidier and pricier. 
Written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, “The Adventures of Tintin” is stitched together from three Hergé books, including “The Secret of the Unicorn.” It begins promisingly enough when Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) spots a model of a ship, the Unicorn, in a market. Taken with its painstaking detail — a nice metaphor for this precisely wrought, vaguely 1940s world — he buys the model, though his purchase is challenged by a mustachioed American detective, Barnaby (Joe Starr), and a meddler of ominous provenance, Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig), whose name is a reminder that Tintin’s inaugural comic pitted him against the Bolsheviks. (“I think the dirty little bourgeois is asleep,” a Bolshevik agent says in “Tintin in the Land of the Soviets,” before failing to blow him up.) 
Tintin keeps the model, in which he finds the riddle that sets him and Snowy off on a series of zippily choreographed chases that first take them from their home in Brussels to a freighter, where they meet Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), a blustering boozer who’s more amusing on the page than onscreen. Haddock, one of Tintin’s frequent comrades in adventure, holds the secret to the mystery, though he’s initially too loaded to know it. (Tintin may tsk-tsk Haddock’s sousing ways, but the movie takes a blithely amused view of drunkenness.) It’s only later, when Haddock dries up while lost and hallucinating in a desert — in a wonderful sequence in which crested sand dunes melt into peaking ocean waves and back again — does he offer relief beyond the comic. 
It’s easy to see why Mr. Spielberg took on Tintin, which he has described as “Indiana Jones for kids” (a redundant notion). The most involved chase sequence in the movie finds Tintin and company creatively racing through, and laying waste to, Bagghar, much as Indy does to a stretch of Cairo in “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” In contrast to “Raiders,” which sees Indy shooting a sword-wielding opponent in a jokey illustration of Western imperialist might, Tintin’s adventures here feel willfully guileless: colonialism may haunt Tintin’s world as imagined by Hergé, but it doesn’t trouble this one. Tintin is racing after the riddle of the Unicorn, but mostly he’s chasing mystery for mystery’s sake, a search that — once he bonds with Haddock — transforms into a more personally redemptive quest. 
In this boy-chases-man world there’s scarcely room for women. Hope and Crosby had Dorothy Lamour, but that kind of honey trap would bring Eros into the equation, thereby endangering the childlike innocence ( really, a convenient naïveté) that defines Tintin, a character who’s as resolutely neutered as his dog presumably is. So instead, the story trots out a sole distaff representative in the ludicrous form of Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel), a dowager diva with a barrel build and a glass-shattering voice. One high note later and the scene has gone kablooey, setting off another round of Rube Goldberg-like calamities that keep Tintin hopping and running and jumping and driving and chasing — as the virtual cameras swoop and dip — like a Tom and Jerry cartoon on repeat. 
Mr. Bell imports boyish wonder into Tintin’s voice, but there’s nothing he can do with the way the character looks. Neither fully human nor fully animated, Mr. Spielberg’s Tintin resembles Hergé’s creation yet is eerily different, as if, like Pinocchio’s, his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted. This Tintin is lifelike, but without the pulse of real life. The problem is that Mr. Spielberg has erred on the side of verisimilitude with a technology — in which an actor’s movements and facial gestures are transmitted via electrodes to a computer — that because it’s a simulacrum of life, still works better for otherworldly creatures like the blue Pandorans in “Avatar” or broad caricatures like Tintin’s bubbling allies, the detective duo Thompson and Thomson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). 
Drawn in a simple, elegant style known as clear line, Hergé’s Tintin has a spherical head, a stub nose and black ovals for eyes. His half-circle brows sit on his face like accent marks and, with his red-smudged cheeks and beads of sweat that invariably pop off his head, give Tintin surprising expressivity. 
The simplicity is as crucial to the comic’s power as is Hergé’s ability to turn a recognizable world into bold lines and blots of color. It’s a face that looks like a mask, one readers can slip on as they rush through the story or leisurely turn the page. And it’s a face that, along with Tintin’s asexuality and lack of a family, makes him into a marvelous blank, an avatar for armchair adventurers. 
Like the screen Tintin, the movie proves less than inviting because it’s been so wildly overworked: there is hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes. Relax, you think, as Tintin and the story rush off again, as if Mr. Spielberg were afraid of losing us with European-style longueurs. Bore us? He’s Steven Spielberg! This lack of modulation grows tedious, which is too bad because, as always with him, there are interludes of cinematic delight, when his visual imagination (like the transition in which Tintin and Haddock seem to appear in a puddle someone steps in) and his Spielbergian playfulness get the better of his insistence on bludgeoning us with technique. 
“The Adventures of Tintin” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Bloodless gun violence and head bashing. 
‽
‽Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows‽,‽Robert Downey Jr. is currently carrying two movie franchises — the Marvel “Iron Man” proto-“Avengers” thing for Paramount and the brawling steampunk “Sherlock Holmes” series for Warner Brothers — so it is perhaps understandable that he is showing a touch of fatigue. In the new Holmes adventure, “A Game of Shadows,” his imperiousness is hard to distinguish from boredom, and he seems to be in a hurry to spit out his lines, take his lumps, throw his punches and collect his paycheck. 
Can a movie be hyperactive and lazy at the same time? Clever and idiotic? If the director is Guy Ritchie, the questions answer themselves. Like its predecessor “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” confects a smoky, overcast Victorian world, infuses it with an air of jocular, hairy laddishness and stages a lot of fights in fussy and tiresome slow motion. There is a plot, but no real intrigue, mystery or suspense, and no inkling of anything at stake beyond a childish and belligerent idea of fun. 
What a shame. Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective, with his violin, his deerstalker and his steel-trap mind, has been one of the most resilient and adaptable figures in Anglophone popular culture. He has been updated, travestied and conscripted into preposterous tales so many times — including by Doyle himself — that it is silly to hold his character sacred, or to scold Mr. Ritchie for taking liberties. But you would think that a man of such reputed brilliance and erudition (I’m talking about Holmes) would at least know how to pronounce the word “heinous” or use “crescendo” properly in a sentence. And you would think that a brewing showdown between Holmes and his nemesis, Moriarty (Jared Harris), would involve intrigue, suspense and devilish plots and counterplots. 
Not that thinking is in any way relevant. There are a few dabs of sophistication — the witty, walrussy presence of Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s brother; a disquisition on Schubert’s great lieder and a morsel of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” — but these feel random and perfunctory. The real point of the movie is the bantering byplay between Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) punctuated by punches, explosions and action sequences as bloated and pretentious as a 10-minute drum solo on a live album by a second-rate art-rock band from the ’70s. 
Rachel McAdams bustles through the action in a bustle; Noomi Rapace lingers a bit longer in long tresses and Gypsy garb. There is not enough of Eddie Marsan and just enough of Mr. Harris, sneering through a ginger beard, to make you root for the Napoleon of Crime against the foppish fool from Baker Street. Who is oddly mopey this time out, as if needing to reassure us of his sensitive, vulnerable side. 
Poor Sherlock. He is so desperate for attention, so needy — perhaps because of the competition from the likes of Tom Cruise and Tintin — that you are likely to reach the point of exasperation long before Watson does. 
“Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes fisticuffs, explosions, naughty innuendo.

‽
‽Cook County‽,‽“Cook County” opens on a shot of white powder and its maker, Bump (Anson Mount), informing his fellow addicts of the “public service” he’s providing. Flexing biceps no druggie deserves and drawing out his vowels with the deep-throated groan of a creaky barn door, Bump is one of the more despicable cinematic creations of recent years. Worshiping bong, crystals and powder equally, holed up in his isolated East Texas meth lab, he’s the epitome of backwoods sleaze and strung-out self-delusion. 
Sharing Bump’s squalid shack are his teenage nephew, Abe (Ryan Donowho), and Abe’s newly clean father, Sonny (Xander Berkeley), recently returned from a two-year stint in the pokey. Sonny has a pressing secret agenda, but for now he’s happy to help his son snatch Bump’s 6-year-old daughter, Deandra (Makenna Fitzsimmons), from the many precipices created by her father’s questionable child-rearing choices. They won’t always succeed, but Deandra’s role as a symbol of imperiled innocence requires them to try. 
With its twanging soundtrack and timeless shots of convenience store aisles and sniff-and-smoke bacchanals, “Cook County” has a grimy, redneck authenticity. There are fireworks in the yard and tokers in the kitchen, but we don’t need cross-cutting between Bump’s domestic deprivation and the overfilled fridge of his affluent Houston relatives to underscore his muddled priorities. What we need is for the writer and director, David Pomes, to wallow less in aimless dialogue and lowlife sordidness. What we need is a point. 
‽
‽Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked‽,‽There is chipmunk gambling. There is seductive dancing by Chipettes wearing only towels. There is a musical gag involving the lyric “whip my tail back and forth.” How “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked” ended up with only a G rating is a mystery. 
Alvin, Theodore, Simon and the gal pals they picked up earlier in the franchise are back, and their human minder, Dave (Jason Lee), comes up with the not-very-bright idea of taking them on a cruise. (The Carnival line gets perhaps the largest product placement in film history.) 
The whole gang ends up shipwrecked on a tropical island, along with the nefarious Ian (David Cross, who near the end delivers the film’s funniest speech) and lots of references to the Tom Hanks movie “Cast Away” that will elude the 5-year-olds in the audience. 
Also on the island is Jenny Slate (playing a character named Zoe), who may have been exiled there after using the worst possible swear word in her first show as a member of the “Saturday Night Live” cast in 2009. No swear words here; just harmless fun. A particularly nice touch: Some of the ’munks change personalities as a result of a spider bite. Alvin the Responsible? Believe it. 
Noteworthy names provide some of the animated voices — Justin Long, Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler — though that money might have been better spent elsewhere. Once they’re run through the chip-erator, these familiar voices are of course unrecognizable. 
‽
‽My Piece of the Pie‽,‽In “My Piece of the Pie,” Gilles Lellouche, a handsome, rough-around-the-edges French star who could be the next generation’s Gérard Depardieu, nails the essence of a predatory capitalist shark. Having spent 10 years in London, his swaggering character, Stéphane (in England he’s called Steve), is dispatched to Paris to start a hedge fund. Before he leaves, his Mephistophelean mentor counsels, “Business is not a sport for gentlemen; it’s not for good people.” To which Stéphane assures him, “I’m bad!” And he is. 
Watching him operate, you think of the traders in “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room” heard boasting of wreaking havoc with the California power grid for the fun of it. When you’re as young as Stéphane, who is 35, rich and on top of the world, how could it not go to your head? In one scene he gives an online tutorial on how to make a quick 60,000 euros (about $80,000) by betting on currency fluctuations. 
With women he is a charming, selfish rogue who pilots a supermodel to Venice in his private plane, then sulks when she won’t sleep with him because she has to “feel something.” His closest thing to a true love — Mélody (Raphaële Godin), who dumped him after he cheated — is his tough, sexy female equivalent at another brokerage house. He wants her back and whines that it wasn’t cheating because it was only with a call girl, “and that doesn’t count.” When he makes a pass at a woman, he lunges like a famished crocodile. 
Because “My Piece of the Pie,” which was written and directed by Cédric Klapisch, predates the present-day euro crisis, it feels a little behind the curve. Once settled in Paris in a sleek penthouse apartment with a gym, an Eiffel Tower view and a stack of six computer screens beside his desk, Stéphane acquires an attractive housekeeper, portentously named France (Karin Viard). Along with 1,200 others, France lost her job of 20 years when her company in the port city Dunkirk was “iced,” to use one of Stéphane’s favorite words, and the labor outsourced to China. As she later learns to her chagrin, Stéphane masterminded the deal. 
Most of “My Piece of the Pie” is told from France’s point of view. A divorced 42-year-old mother of three adolescent girls, she is a volatile piece of work whose reaction to being fired is a feeble suicide attempt. She is constantly arguing with her spoiled oldest daughter, Lucie (Flavie Bataillie), who shares her highly developed sense of injustice. 
When Stéphane’s ex-wife, without notice, drops off their 3-year-old son, Alban (Lunis Sakji), at the apartment before taking a month’s vacation, he persuades France to be his full-time baby sitter and raises her salary. She also doubles as Stéphane’s arm candy at business functions, where she is instructed to put on a foreign accent when she has to speak. In these scenes “My Piece of the Pie” veers unsteadily from mild social satire to farce. 
To its credit, the movie doesn’t collapse into sentimental mush when Stéphane begins to bond with his frisky little boy. If he displays a glimmer of heart, he doesn’t experience the kind of bogus redemption that a Hollywood movie would demand. Just when you expect the story to settle into a formula, it takes a sharp left turn that makes you question France’s judgment. 
The movie’s tone, like its locations, is continually shifting. At times it suggests a slightly unhinged Gallic answer to “Up in the Air.” As the story races along, it begins to lurch. Stéphane’s dialogue consistently crackles, but the same can’t be said of France’s. She becomes a political scold in her most serious moments. At the same time, she is too emotionally unstable to be a trustworthy moral grounding wire. 
Like Mr. Klapisch’s earlier films “L’Auberge Espagnole” and “Russian Dolls,” “My Piece of the Pie” paints an alluring picture of a pan-European cosmopolitan culture whose characters hopscotch from one country to another with hardly a second thought in a lighthearted floating party. Now, of course, there are alarming signs that the party is about to end.

‽
‽Young Adult‽,‽Shorter than a bad blind date and as sour as a vinegar Popsicle, “Young Adult” shrouds its brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical heart in the superficial blandness of commercial comedy. More radically than “J. Edgar” or even “Greenberg,” this movie, written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman, challenges the dreary conventional wisdom that a movie protagonist must be likable. Along the way, it systematically demolishes a china shop full of shopworn sentimental touchstones about — for starters — high school, small-town life, heterosexuality, Minnesota and the capacity of human beings to change, learn and grow. 
When we first encounter her, Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) seems to have grown, though perhaps not in the most constructive ways. Crossing the treacherous, unmarked boundary between her mid- and late-30s, Mavis has acquired some of the trappings and habits of adulthood. She lives in a spacious, slightly sterile high-rise apartment in Minneapolis (a Midwestern variant on the den of Manhattan anomie that Michael Fassbender’s sex-addled character inhabits in “Shame”) and has, for company, a fuzzy little dog and a big, flat-screen television permanently tuned to some Kardashian or another. 
Eventually we hear about a divorce, though not much about the marriage that preceded it. Mavis supports herself by writing installments in a popular series of “Gossip Girl”-like novels for teenagers, and though her name does not appear on the cover, she derives some creative and professional satisfaction from the job. She drinks a lot, pulls at her hair and seems generally unconcerned with other people. She is pretty, poised and imperious in the way that can come naturally to tall, beautiful, blond women, but also weary and blue — a platinum princess suffering from metal fatigue. 
Looking for a way to break out of her rut and return some luster to her life, Mavis decides to go back to her hometown, Mercury, Minn., and reconnect with her high school boyfriend, Buddy (Patrick Wilson). Just how spectacularly bad this idea is — how packed with vanity, magical thinking and plain, stupid meanness — emerges over the course of a few days, but the warning signs are there from the start. 
Buddy, who is married, has just become a father for the first time. To Mavis, this can mean only that he is trapped in a domestic prison from which she must rescue him. And so she arrives in Mercury intent on breaking up his marriage, a plan she justifies to herself in the romantic language of destiny, soul mates and following your heart. 
That is the native idiom of romantic fiction, both the kind Mavis writes and the genre she appears, at first glance, to inhabit. With sly understatement, Ms. Cody and Mr. Reitman (who previously collaborated on “Juno”) allow a set of comfortable expectations to emerge. We all know — from bad movies like “Cars,” say — that a big-city big shot on a visit to a small town will be constructively humbled by the simple, honest folks who live there. (Or else, as in “Straw Dogs,” terrorized by them). We are also conditioned to believe all kinds of contradictory claptrap about adolescence, which we are supposed to leave behind but also hold onto for (if I may show my own age by paraphrasing John Mellencamp) as long as we can. 
One of the incidental pleasures of “Young Adult” is its specific sense of generational identity. The logos of bands like Black Flag, the Breeders and — of course, this being Minnesota — the Replacements serve as tokens of belonging and signifiers of nostalgia. On the road from Minneapolis to Mercury, Mavis plays an old mixtape (an actual cassette, by the way) from Buddy, fixating on “The Concept” by Teenage Fanclub, which serves as the film’s ambiguous anthem. It evokes warm and affectionate memories, but also, in her case, the pathological inability to let go of the past. 
We assume that a romantic comedy will turn on the redirection of desire from the wrong person to the right one. In one sense — I don’t want to say too much about the details of the plot — this expectation and all the others are met. Mavis does get something of a city mouse’s comeuppance; she does come to difficult terms with her vanished youth; and she does find her attention divided between two guys, the hunk who is her heart’s desire and the nerd who serves as a sympathetic ear and shoulder to cry on. But at the same time, the established codes of modern movie comedy are scrambled and subverted in ways that are puzzling, amusing, horrifying and ultimately astonishing. 
The heroine in “Juno” was briefly dazzled by Jason Bateman’s cool, not-nice guy, but she eventually found her way back to the sweet loser played by Michael Cera. That was impeccable young adult logic, but “Young Adult” itself is a little more complicated, and much harsher. 
Buddy is perfectly nice and not especially cool. The other guy, Matt (Patton Oswalt), is kind of prickly and cool in a geeky way. He makes his own action figures, distills his own bourbon (something Mavis especially appreciates) and has an awesome collection of ’90s indie-rock T-shirts. 
He is also a reminder of the brutal underside of high school, which Mavis chooses to remember as a time of power and glory. Back when she was prom queen, he was in the hospital, having survived a horrific beating that left permanent physical damage. 
And yet Mavis can look at him and complain, without irony, about how much she has suffered in her life. Her cruelty and self-pity are downright shocking. If Ms. Theron hadn’t already appeared in a film called “Monster” (for which she won an Oscar), that title might suit “Young Adult” just as well. 
But even as this movie revels in the punitive spectacle of Mavis’s humiliation, it also extends her a measure of sympathy. Not by justifying her appalling behavior, but rather by treating her honestly. 
Popular culture weaves a tapestry of beautiful lies. “I didn’t want to hurt you,” the Teenage Fanclub vocalist swears, over and over, in the chorus of “The Concept.” The book Mavis is working on (we hear snippets in voice-over) is full of paeans to its heroine’s pluck, luck and intelligence. Big-studio comedies lull us with smiles and fairy tales. The truth, in these circumstances, can be a painful shock, even when it makes you laugh. 
“Young Adult” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Harsh language, bad sex, unpleasant situations — grown-up stuff, in other words.

‽
‽The Sitter‽,‽Noah, the nobody’s fool played by Jonah Hill in the breezily indifferent comedy “The Sitter,” is a character in search of a movie, a setup in search of a punch line. Less directed than doodled by David Gordon Green, this on-and-off funny rehash of “Adventures in Babysitting” centers on a college dropout who, at his mother’s urging, reluctantly agrees to mind three children for pay. Somewhat of a big baby himself, Noah sets off with a pout, apparently unaware that most American excursions in comedy these days come with mandatory opportunities for growth. 
One thing leads to another leads to Noah and his three charges running through the New York night in a misadventure that begins with some broken crockery and, like the sticky ball in the Katamari Damacy video game, gathers progressively larger pieces, including a drug dealer, Karl “with a K” (Sam Rockwell), whose minions include a lisping roller skater, bikinied male bodybuilders and JB Smoove from “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Despite Mr. Hill, his three young co-stars and flashes of Looney Tunes-style anarchy — bursts that bring with them the hope that the movie will spin off its axis, shattering into pure mayhem — much of this is as unfunny as it sounds. 
Some of it, though, is absurdly comic, like the shot of a guy on a Segway that exists for no reason other than that someone here thought the movie could use a small laugh right then. It did. It could use more. The episodic script, credited to Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, doesn’t take any actual risks even when it seems as if the filmmakers are trying to, as in a scene that puts the children in the same car as an exploding package of cocaine, a joke that in an earlier age would have involved a bag of flour. The coke gives an otherwise empty interlude a mild kick, but since the children don’t even sniff the air there’s nothing at stake, including the audience’s sensibilities. 
The children, Slater, Blithe and Rodrigò — played by a winning Max Records, Landry Bender and Kevin Hernandez — suffer neuroses that would make Daffy Duck sputter, but they’re eventually in for some Disney-style homilies. None of the story’s squishiness come as a real surprise, though the thinness of the material and Mr. Green’s apparent willingness to settle for so little do. In the last few years he has pursued a path as a mainstream comedy director with a slightly bent take and a fine cinematographer in Tim Orr, a trajectory that has yielded diminishing returns, first with “Pineapple Express” and then with “Your Highness” and now this. The idea, as Steven Soderbergh has shown, is that you’re supposed to make one movie for you and one for them — not everything for them. 
“The Sitter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence, drugs and raunch.

‽
‽New Year's Eve‽,‽“New Year’s Eve” is a depressing two-hour infomercial pitching Times Square as the only place in the universe you want to be when the ball drops at midnight on Dec. 31. (Believe me, it’s not.) 
When that magic moment arrives, oh-so-many stars converge in a downpour of confetti, although I must warn you that the “Jersey Shore” crowd and the Real Housewives are not among the chosen. 
In this cynical makeover of one of the most stressful nights of the year, no one is visibly drunk or shivering in the cold, and except for a few friendly officers, the police presence is minimal. In homage to V-J Day photos taken in Times Square, some of the kisses exchanged as the year changes are of the back-bending kind. Unctuous platitudes about its being a time of forgiveness and new beginnings regularly stall the movie in its tracks. 
“New Year’s Eve” was directed by Garry Marshall (best known for “Pretty Woman”) from a screenplay by Katherine Fugate. Last year the same team gave us the similarly unendurable “Valentine’s Day.” Like its forerunner, “New Year’s Eve” interweaves more than a half-dozen trivial subplots into a cheerlessly cheery mosaic. The screenplay isn’t written so much as assembled in carefully slotted little blocks, following the rules of a screenwriting textbook. 
The most dramatic fragment involves an electrical glitch in which the crystal sphere gets stuck during a trial run. If it isn’t fixed in time, Claire (Hilary Swank), the officious new vice president of the Times Square Alliance, will lose her job. 
Wan comedy is squeezed out of the competition between two couples for a $25,000 prize to be given to the pair that produces their hospital’s first baby of 2012. Meanwhile, a rock star, Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi), while preparing for a concert, is being punished by his former fiancée, Laura (Katherine Heigl), for having backed out of their commitment a year earlier. Mr. Bon Jovi can’t act but he offers decent performances of “I Can’t Turn You Loose” and “Have a Little Faith in Me.” 
Another cutesy piece involves Randy (Ashton Kutcher), a sarcastic comic-book artist who gets stuck in a stalled elevator with Elise (Lea Michele), one of Jensen’s backup singers whom he offends by asking her if she is a groupie. There is the tired story of Kim (Sarah Jessica Parker), an overprotective mom who refuses to let her 15-year-old daughter, Hailey (Abigail Breslin), go to Times Square to collect her first kiss from a dewy high school crush. 
The hunk factor is supplied by Sam (Josh Duhamel), whose highway mishap on the way to the city nearly prevents him from reuniting with a dream girl he met the previous New Year’s Eve; they promised to reconnect a year later at the same restaurant. But will she show up? 
This is an affair not to remember. It vies for the title of most fatuous subplot with the story of Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former assistant to a record company president, who strikes a deal with Paul (Zac Efron), a bike messenger. If he can make the impossible dreams on her wish list come true, she will give him her tickets to a New Year’s masked ball. 
“New Years Eve” visits Radio City Music Hall and the Queens Museum of Art. It brings in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Ryan Seacrest, and Frank Sinatra is heard singing “New York, New York.” The New Yorkers in this film are predominantly white, middle-to-upper-class Manhattanites, and there is no hardship in sight. The most prominent African-American is a selfless nurse (Halle Berry) who cares for Stan (Robert De Niro) a grizzled photojournalist dying of cancer. Stan’s final wish (I’m not kidding!) is to watch from a hospital roof as the ball drops. 
My advice: don’t believe the hype. Having been there — once — I would nominate Times Square as the last place on earth where most sensible people would want to be when the clock strikes midnight. At home asleep with your head under a pillow to blot out the noise is a much cozier alternative. 
“New Year’s Eve” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some mild innuendo and scattered profanity.

‽One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das‽,‽Meditation is a way to practice letting go of expectations. In that spirit, “One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das” is a fine enough documentary, a nice enough introduction to a charismatic figure with a fascinating life, an unusual art and worldwide fans. 
Still, Maharajji sent him back to the United States and, soon after, died. His devotee then felt lost in grief, wrestling with depression and drugs before remembering his promise to his guru: I will sing for you in America. 
Yet Krishna Das, having reversed his life’s course several times, is no stereotypical mystic: He wears his Long Island heritage as closely as he does his red flannel and red T-shirts (red being popular among followers of the deity Hanuman, who practice service). Casual, humble and appealing, likely to speak obscenities as well as ideas, he is a thoughtful talker in the lengthy, medium-frame shots in this film, and the images of his youth and time in India offer some visual context. 
‽
‽Code of the West‽,‽It’s all about protecting the young people, of course. “We stand to lose a whole generation of kids,” Cherrie Brady, a community advocate, says in “Code of the West.” 
But the whole thing comes down to Lori Burnam, navigating her modest home while attached to various tubes. Marijuana, she says, is the only medication that relieves her pain from cancer and emphysema without incapacitating side effects. Near the end of the film she has to switch to morphine. Burnam died in January.

‽High Tech, Low Life‽,‽Profiling two of China’s so-called citizen reporters, Stephen Maing’s “High Tech, Low Life” offers an inside look at an outsider vocation. 
‽
‽Django Unchained‽,‽“It’s better than ‘Lincoln,’ ” my teenage daughter said, as the end credits rolled at a screening of Quentin Tarantino’s “Django Unchained.” She was teasing me — it’s a sad fact of my life that some of the people I’m fondest of do not seem to share my fondness for Steven Spielberg’s latest movie — but also suggesting an interesting point of comparison. 
“Lincoln” and “Django Unchained,” the one a sober historical drama and the other a wild and bloody live-action cartoon, are essentially about different solutions to the same problem. You could almost imagine the two films, or at least their heroes, figuring in the kind of good-natured, racial-stereotype humor that used to be a staple of stand-up comedy (and was memorably parodied on “The Simpsons”): “white guys abolish slavery like this” (pass constitutional amendment); “but black guys, they abolish slavery like this” (blow up plantation). 
A more substantive contrast might be drawn between the approaches of two filmmakers — both steeped in the history of popular cinema and both brilliant craftsmen whose skill inspires admiration, as well as a measure of suspicion — to a subject full of pain and fraught with peril. Mr. Spielberg, in his ambitious, history-minded projects, hews to the proud (though sometimes mocked) tradition of the Hollywood A picture, in which big themes are addressed with appropriately sweeping visual and emotional gestures. Mr. Tarantino finds inspiration in what are still frequently seen as less reputable genres and styles: Asian martial arts movies, spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation. 
Not that you need, at this point, to choose. Among Mr. Tarantino’s achievements has been his successful argument that the maligned and neglected B movies of the past should be viewed with fresh eyes and unironic respect. His own tributes to the outlaw, outsider film tradition — flamboyant in their scholarly care and in their bold originality — have suggested new ways of taking movies seriously. “Django Unchained” is unabashedly and self-consciously pulpy, with camera moves and musical cues that evoke both the cornfed westerns of the 1950s and their pastafied progeny of the next decade. (The title comes from a series of Italian action movies whose first star, Franco Nero, shows up here in a cameo.) It is digressive, jokey, giddily brutal and ferociously profane. But it is also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism. 
As such, “Django Unchained” is obviously a companion to “Inglourious Basterds,” in which Mr. Tarantino had the audacity to turn the Nazi war against the Jews into the backdrop for a farcical, ultraviolent caper. He did not simply depart from the facts of history, inventing, in the title characters, a squad of mostly Jewish-American killers led by a United States Army lieutenant from Tennessee; he rewrote the past in the vivid, visceral language of film fantasy. 
The point of “Inglourious Basterds” was not to engage in counterfactual speculation about a successful plot to kill Hitler, but rather to carry out a vicarious, belated and altogether impossible form of revenge, using the freedom of cinematic make-believe to even the score. 
Like “Inglourious Basterds,” “Django Unchained” is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness. Christoph Waltz, who played the charming, sadistic SS officer Hans Landa in “Basterds,” here plays Dr. King Schultz, a charming, sadistic German bounty hunter (masquerading as an itinerant dentist) whose distaste for slavery makes him the hero’s ally and mentor. 
That hero, first glimpsed in shackles and rags on a cold Texas night in 1858, is Django (Jamie Foxx), who becomes Schultz’s sidekick and business partner. Schultz is an amoral gun for hire, tracking down fugitives and habitually choosing the first option offered in the formulation “Wanted: Dead or Alive.” 
Over time the traditional roles of white gunslinger and nonwhite sidekick are reversed, as the duo’s mission shifts from Schultz’s work to the rescue of Django’s wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). After the couple tried to run away from their former plantation together, they were whipped and branded (the horrific punishment is shown in flashback), and Broomhilda was sold. 
Django and Schultz’s search for her leads them to Candyland, a Mississippi estate whose debonair master, Calvin Candie, is played with almost indecent flair by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is assisted in his savagery by Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), a house slave who may be the most shocking invention in “Django Unchained.” He is an Uncle Tom whose servility has mutated into monstrosity and who represents the symbolic self Django must destroy to assert and maintain his freedom. 
The plot is, by Mr. Tarantino’s standards, fairly linear, without the baroque chronology of “Pulp Fiction” or the parallel story lines of “Inglourious Basterds.” But the movie does take its time, and it wanders over a wide expanse of geographic and thematic territory. 
In addition to Mr. Tarantino’s trademark dialogue-heavy, suspense-filled set pieces, there are moments of pure silliness, like a gathering of hooded night riders (led by Don Johnson), and a late escapade (featuring Mr. Tarantino speaking in an Australian accent) that perhaps owes more to Bugs Bunny than to any other cultural archetype. 
Of course, the realm of the archetypal is where popular culture lives, and Mr. Tarantino does not hesitate to train his revisionist energies on some deep and ancient national legends. Like many westerns, “Django Unchained” latches onto a simple, stark picture of good and evil, and takes homicidal vengeance as the highest — if not the only — form of justice. 
But in placing his story of righteous payback in the Old South rather than the Wild West, and in making its agent a black former slave, Mr. Tarantino exposes and defies an ancient taboo. With the brief and fascinating exception of the blaxploitation movies and a few other works of radical or renegade art, vengeance in the American imagination has been the virtually exclusive prerogative of white men. More than that, the sanctification and romanticization of revenge have been central to the ideology of white supremacy. 
In “Regeneration Through Violence,” his classic study of the mythology of the frontier, from colonial times to the eve of the Civil War, the literary historian Richard Slotkin identifies two essential mythic figures: the captive, usually an innocent woman held against her will by ruthless and alien usurpers, and the hunter, who is obsessed with protecting her honor and, sometimes secondarily, securing her freedom. (“The Searchers,” with John Wayne as the hunter and Natalie Wood as the captive, is perhaps the most sophisticated modern version of this narrative.) 
Broomhilda and Django certainly fit those roles, and yet the roles, historically, were not intended for them. Some abolitionist works like “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” could paint slavery as a form of captivity, but the canonical captives of antebellum American literature were white women kidnapped by Indians, who after the Civil War were often replaced by freed slaves as objects of superstitious terror. The idea that regenerative violence could be visited by black against white instead of the reverse — that a man like Django could fill out the contours of the hunter — has been almost literally unthinkable. 
But think about that when the hand-wringing starts about “Django Unchained” and ask yourself why the violence in this movie will suddenly seem so much more problematic, so much more regrettable, than what passes without comment in “Jack Reacher” or “Taken 2.” Mr. Tarantino is a virtuoso of bloodshed, that is for sure, and also more enamored of a particularly toxic racial slur than any decent white man should be. But decency in the conventional sense is not his concern, though in another sense it very much is. When you wipe away the blood and the anarchic humor, what you see in “Django Unchained” is moral disgust with slavery, instinctive sympathy for the underdog and an affirmation (in the relationship between Django and Schultz) of what used to be called brotherhood. 
So maybe it’s not so different from “Lincoln,” after all. And if “Django Unchained” is not better, it is arguably more radical, both as cinema and as (fanciful) history. A double feature might be just the thing, if you have five and a half hours to spare. By any means necessary! 
“Django Unchained” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Grisly violence (both comical and horrible); vile language (ditto). 
‽
‽Parental Guidance‽,‽“Parental Guidance,” a new comedy with Billy Crystal, is about a minor-league baseball announcer who, after he’s canned for being an old shtick in the mud (he doesn’t tweet), develops a new relationship with his daughter and grandkids. Actually, he teaches everyone a lot of lessons — it’s revenge of the geezer — allowing him to have his curmudgeonly cake and eat it too. Mostly, though, “Parental Guidance” is what families who are desperate to get out of the house over the holidays and need to bridge the generational divide will see after they’ve seen “Les Misérables.” 
It could be worse, and would be without Bette Midler or Marisa Tomei. Ms. Midler plays Diane, the saint married to Mr. Crystal’s Artie Decker. The kooky Diane is first seen, halfheartedly and fully clothed, working a stripper pole in her living room alongside her gal pals. (They seem to have brought their own.) Before Artie’s early retirement can kick in, their daughter, Alice (Ms. Tomei), phones and asks if Grandma and Grandpa can baby-sit her three children while she and her husband, Phil (Tom Everett Scott), take a trip. Diane is delighted, Artie dubious, but they pack up and descend with inappropriate gifts (Artie gives out bobblehead figures of himself), life lessons and a hands-on parenting philosophy that encompasses criminal negligence and Dr. Spock-style common sense. 
Written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse, and directed with snap by Andy Fickman, “Parental Guidance” hits its familiar buttons hard and often. Alice and her family live in a so-called smart house that comes with a talking computer that turns on appliances, greets the family and serves as a strained metaphor for what ails this brood. Alice and Phil have delegated, or perhaps surrendered, some of the basic chores of life to the computer, an early signal that these Apache helicopter parents have created a somewhat inauthentic life for their children. Diane and especially Artie (who’s so technologically clueless he has trouble answering a phone) respond to this newfangled alienation by plying the tots with sugar, a round of kick-the-can and the unaccustomed sound of the word “no.” 
Does it work? You betcha. There are smiles and tears, love and affirmations, a few funny jokes and a lot of easy sentimentality. At one point Artie and Diane sing a song, delighting the children and suggesting that more tunes would have been a nice idea here. Any time Ms. Midler is around, it’s smart to have her sing. She and Ms. Tomei are sympathetic, likable screen presences, but there isn’t much for them to do except smile indulgently at, and be upstaged by, men and children alike. And while this may nominally be a family affair, don’t be fooled for a second: this is Mr. Crystal’s show from opening to close, and he is not especially good about sharing. 
“Parental Guidance” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). But not really required. 
‽
‽Jack Reacher‽,‽“Who are you, Mister?” a young woman asks Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), and it’s a question that recurs, not always quite so politely, throughout the movie that bears Reacher’s name. He may be an elusive individual with a sketchy background — ex-military, no fixed address, a single shirt to his name — but as an archetype he is easy enough to recognize. He is a cousin of Shane and Caine (from the old “Kung Fu” television series) and Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name: a paladin without portfolio who travels from town to town, dispensing righteous violence and hard-boiled aphorisms. 
“It’s just what guys like me do,” Reacher says wearily at one point, though he could say it at just about any point. 
Guys like him are mythical creatures, fantasy figures who dispense rough justice when civic institutions fail. Part comic-book superhero, part Old West vigilante and wholly preposterous, Reacher is far less enigmatic than he or anyone else in the movie thinks he is. And also less interesting. 
Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie and adapted from “One Shot,” the ninth in Lee Child’s series of macho best sellers, “Jack Reacher” brings its hero to Pittsburgh, where a sniper has just shot down five innocent people, including a nanny accompanying a small child, in broad daylight. The suspected shooter (Joseph Sikora) lies in a coma — after scrawling “Get Jack Reacher” on a pad in lieu of a confession — with a seemingly airtight case against him. Shell casings, fingerprints at the scene, security-camera video, all the usual stuff that disciplined television crime-show viewers will recognize as solid circumstantial evidence. 
But the man’s lawyer, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), hires Reacher anyway, possibly because she thinks he might keep her client off death row, and possibly because she, like every other woman in (and presumably beyond) the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is made weak in the knees by Reacher’s off-the-charts sexual magnetism. 
Helen also has some daddy issues, mainly that her daddy (Richard Jenkins) is the district attorney prosecuting the presumed killer. He and the lead detective on the case (David Oyelowo) are obviously too sure of themselves to be trusted, and even before we meet a character known as the Zec (Werner Herzog, whose casting raises a brief film-geek frisson) we know that the poor fellow in the coma is a patsy. We also know, just because of the kind of guy Jack Reacher is, that the body count is sure to rise. 
And so “Jack Reacher” lumbers through a series of beatings, shootings and bludgeonings on its way to a climactic, not terribly surprising showdown. There is a pretty good car chase and a lot of very bad dialogue. Mr. McQuarrie, on his second outing as a director (his screenplays include “The Usual Suspects” and “Valkyrie”), seems more suited to action scenes than to the ostensibly simpler task of filming people talking. Nearly every conversation is stilted and lame, laden with the kind of repartee that might strike you as witty if you had no sense of humor. 
The self-confident, supercompetent Reacher is a character Mr. Cruise could play in his sleep, which is pretty much what he does. Ms. Pike seems a bit more agitated, perhaps because she is too refined an actress for the kind of pulpy sincerity the movie requires. She tries very hard to make sense of Helen’s emotions and motives, which is a hopeless task, since the character is an inexplicable collage of empathy, ambition and neediness, on hand to awaken Reacher’s chivalrous impulses and to quiver with confused desire whenever he is in the room. 
Apart from the car chase, the only real fun in “Jack Reacher” comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall, called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine. They enliven the movie’s atmosphere of weary brutality for a few moments, but they also call attention to the dullness of their dramatic surroundings. 
“Jack Reacher” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Violence and some swearing. 
‽
‽This Is 40‽,‽What’s going on with Pete and Debbie? First of all: You remember Pete and Debbie, don’t you? They were the designated grown-ups played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann in “Knocked Up,” a movie about the accidental conception and hilarious gestation of their niece. If you want an update on that child, who would be in kindergarten by now, you won’t find it in “This Is 40,” Judd Apatow’s “sort-of sequel” to the earlier movie and the fourth feature film he has directed. (The baby’s parents were played by Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, who have moved on to other things.) 
This one is all about Pete and Debbie, who, along with their two daughters, occupy a big white house in one of Los Angeles’s nicer ZIP codes and who, in the course of a hectic week, undergo — well, what, exactly? A matched set of midlife crises? A rough patch in their marriage? A flurry of “first-world problems” so trivial as to be an insult to the planet’s struggling masses? A seminar in postmodern, postfeminist gender politics? Yes, sure, all of that, but to drop their troubles into such neat conceptual boxes would be to simplify a situation that is both agreeably and annoyingly messy. 
All of a sudden — and not, you suspect, for the first time — the stresses of work, parenthood, money and intimacy threaten to add up to something big and scary. Pete’s record label is in financial peril, which he hopes the success of a new album by the British New Wave stalwart Graham Parker will dispel. Debbie, who owns a boutique, suspects that one of her employees (either Charlyne Yi or Megan Fox) is embezzling money. Pete’s father (Albert Brooks) is a noodge and a sponge, constantly borrowing money from his grown son to support his do-over lifestyle, which features rambunctious blond triplets. Debbie’s dad (John Lithgow), who also has a second family, is a chilly, intermittent presence in her life. 
Then there are the adolescent mood swings of Pete and Debbie’s older daughter, Sadie (Maude Apatow), and the skirmishes that break out between Sadie and her irrepressible younger sister, Charlotte (Iris Apatow). 
Hovering over all of this hectic business is something vaguer, deeper and sadder: a malaise in Pete and Debbie’s relationship that leads them to question the foundations of their marriage. In a panic in the wake of a momentous birthday, Debbie embarks on a campaign of family self-improvement, limiting screen time, cooking healthy meals and nagging everyone into a frenzy that almost matches her own. For his part, Pete clowns, mopes and steals away to the bathroom to play with his iPad. 
Cushioned by comforts that most of their fellow citizens can scarcely imagine, they nonetheless feel as if things were starting to go pear-shaped. (Only metaphorically: The two of them are enviably trim, in spite of Pete’s weakness for cupcakes. He bikes a lot.) 
“Do you still even like me?” Debbie asks her husband in one of many moments of vulnerability. 
An entirely plausible answer would be: Who cares? We’ve all got troubles, sister. But I want to suggest that the movie’s ability to foresee — even to welcome — a hostile or indifferent response counts in its favor. “This Is 40” is an intensely, at times embarrassingly, personal film, by a man who has worked hard, lucked out and wants to share some of his happiness and its attendant worries with the rest of us. Mr. Apatow is, quite literally, showing off his lovely wife (that would be Ms. Mann) and their lively, talented daughters, and if Mr. Rudd is not precisely an alter ego (a description that might equally apply to Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell and plenty of other male performers in comedies bearing the Apatow brand), he is at least a plausible place holder. He is nice but not cloying, goofy but not dumb, smart but not snotty, and good-looking in a way that doesn’t make the rest of us feel too bad about ourselves. 
Mr. Brooks, a godfather of neurotic, passive-aggressive film comedy, once made a movie called “Defending Your Life.” Mr. Apatow, though he has absorbed some of Mr. Brooks’s deadpan, buried-joke filmmaking style, does not share his penchant for anxious introspection. The social milieu of “This Is 40” is generationally, geographically and professionally adjacent to the one explored by Larry David in “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” but any trace of that show’s self-lacerating misanthropy has been filtered out of the Southern California air. A gaggle of funny troupers — including Melissa McCarthy, Jason Segel, Chris O’Dowd and Lena Dunham — shuffles through the picture, offering up bursts of shtick, but there is more sweetness than cruelty in most of their antics. 
In other words, for all its crude jokes and on-the-money observations of the tastes and consumer habits of aging white Gen X-ers (we still love the Pixies!), “This Is 40” should not be mistaken for satire. While it makes fun of some of Pete’s and Debbie’s foibles and blind spots — his immaturity, her neediness, their complementary ways of not listening to each other — it declines to treat the characters as types or to treat their behavior as symptomatic. 
The audience, of course, is free to take up the slack, to despise Pete and Debbie, even at the risk of hypocrisy. Look at those two, fretting about money, with a BMW and a Lexus in the driveway, the kids in private school and enough left over for a romantic resort getaway and a lavish catered birthday party. 
In a town that runs on philanthropic fund-raisers and celebrity activism, Pete and Debbie support no cause beyond themselves. They are complacent, over-entitled and kind of mean. But the film’s refusal of the detachment that would make them easy targets for judgment is finally a mark of integrity, even generosity. You are brought into a state of intimacy, of complicity, with characters you may find it difficult to like but who, at the same time, require constant affirmation of their goodness. 
And they are good, or at least good enough. So is the movie. It snuggles up next to you, breathes in your face, dribbles crumbs on your shirt and laughs at its own jokes. Such proximity makes it easy to notice flaws, and there are a lot of loose ends and a few forced conclusions. But, then again, the acceptance of imperfection is Mr. Apatow’s theme, so a degree of sloppiness is to be expected. That’s life. 
“This Is 40” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, drug use, smoking and swearing. They say it’s the new 20. 
‽
‽The Guilt Trip‽,‽Contrary to what the title and casting might suggest, the Barbra Streisand-Seth Rogen comedy, “The Guilt Trip,” is not “The Shrew and the Cringing Meatball.” There are no screaming accusations, no threats or recriminations, no tearful apologies in this amiable mother-son road odyssey. 
The guilt that Ms. Streisand’s character, Joyce Brewster, lays on her grown son, Andy (Mr. Rogen), a struggling inventor, is larded with enough sweetness and awareness of appropriate boundaries that its humor caresses rather than stings. Joyce’s complaints mostly have to do with Andy’s decision to live 3,000 miles away from her in Los Angeles. When his mother becomes overbearing, Andy, sucking in his lower lip, politely silences her. Joyce, even at her most psychologically invasive, never whines or raises her voice. 
Directed by Anne Fletcher (“The Proposal,” “27 Dresses”) from a pallid screenplay by Dan Fogelman (“Crazy, Stupid, Love”), “The Guilt Trip” is so comfy cozy that mothers and their grown children can watch it together without squirming. Even Joyce’s recollection of the time Andy’s penis turned purple is a zany throwaway remark delivered without a trace of Freudian insinuation. 
What could have been a cutting satirical farce about domineering mothers and emasculated sons is a mildly funny, feel-good love story in which Mom’s sensible advice helps turn around her nerdy son’s foundering career. Although the main characters are softened Jewish stereotypes, there is no mention of religion. 
Andy, who studied organic chemistry at U.C.L.A., is traveling around the country pitching an organic cleaning product he invented that consists of coconut and palm-kernel oils, and soy. You can even drink it. But his presentations are so stiff and jargony that potential backers nod off while he is talking. 
When Andy makes a rare visit to see Joyce in New Jersey, he and his mother begin reminiscing. Joyce remembers her first boyfriend before she married Andy’s father, who died when Andy was 8. She has since had no love life. 
Andy, sleuthing on the Internet, discovers an unmarried corporate executive living in San Francisco who has the same name as that boyfriend. He invites his mother to join him on his eight-day cross-country return trip without telling her of his plan to look up her first love at the end of the journey. Joyce, not knowing his agenda, jumps at the opportunity to be with her only child for several days. 
One bland running joke is Joyce’s obsessive thrift. She insists that they rent a subcompact car instead of an S.U.V., a decision he regrets when they find themselves sandwiched between trucks in an Arkansas blizzard. Joyce also insists that they share the same room in motels and disturbs him with her habit of crunching handfuls of M&amp;Ms while in bed. Since Ms. Streisand, now 70, looks 20 years younger, it is not implausible when one leering motel clerk mistakes them for lovers. But the movie makes little of the confusion. 
Joyce is frisky and game for adventure, and in a Lubbock, Tex., steakhouse she agrees to play beat the clock while consuming a 50-ounce steak. This challenge, which could have been milked for farce, is another missed comic opportunity in a movie so timid it seems afraid of its own shadow. The chief pleasures of this mild-mannered dud lie in watching two resourceful comic actors go through their paces like the pros they are. 
“The Guilt Trip” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild innuendo and some strong language.

‽Trashed‽,‽“This is appalling,” says the actor Jeremy Irons, surveying a reeking mountain of consumer waste fouling a once glorious beach in Lebanon. 
That spoiled shoreline is only one of many revolting sights in “Trashed,” Candida Brady’s down-and-dirty documentary about our inability to neutralize safely much of what we throw away. Taking us on a global tour of escalating rubbish and toxic disposal options, Ms. Brady rubs our faces in the poisonous consequences of littering the planet with substances that, like bedbugs and French mimes, are almost impossible to get rid of. 
But if we must talk trash, Mr. Irons — assisted by a scientist or two and Vangelis’s doomy score — is an inspired choice of guide. Soothing and sensitive, his liquid gaze alighting on oozing landfills and belching incinerators, he moves through the film with a tragic dignity that belies his whimsical neckwear and jaunty hats. Every sterile whale and plastic-choked turtle is a dagger in his heart (and will be in yours too), to say nothing of the farmers ruined by chemically contaminated livestock. 
By the time Mr. Irons visits a Vietnamese hospital for children with severe birth defects — the legacy of Agent Orange — that plastic water bottle in your hand will feel as dangerous as a Molotov cocktail.

‽The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey‽,‽In “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s first Middle-earth fantasy novel, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) sets out with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a posse of dwarfs to battle a fearsome dragon. [Spoiler alert] they do not kill the dragon, although [spoiler alert] they eventually will, within the next 18 months or so, because [spoiler alert] this “Hobbit,” which is [migraine alert] 170 minutes, is the first installment in [film critic suicide-watch alert] a trilogy. 
What’s that old saying so memorably garbled by a recent president? Fool me twice — won’t get fooled again! This is not to say that Mr. Jackson is a con man. On the contrary: He is a visionary, an entrepreneur, a job creator in his native New Zealand. And his “Lord of the Rings” movies, the last of which opened nine years ago, remain a mighty modern gesamtkunstwerk, a grand Wagnerian blend of pop-culture mythology and digital magic now available for easy, endless viewing in your living room. 
“The Lord of the Rings” was the work of a filmmaker perfectly in tune with his source material. Its too-muchness — the encyclopedic detail, the pseudoscholarly exposition, the soaring allegory, the punishing length — was as much a product of Tolkien’s literary sensibility as of Mr. Jackson’s commitment to cinematic maximalism. These were three films to rule them all, and they conjured an imaginary world of remarkable complexity and coherence. This voyage, which takes place 60 years before Frodo’s great quest, is not nearly as captivating. 
Part of this has to do with tone. The “Rings” trilogy, much of which was written during World War II, is a dark, monumental epic of Good and Evil in conflict, whereas “The Hobbit,” first published in 1937 (and later revised), is a more lighthearted book, an adventure story whose comical and fairy-tale elements are very much in the foreground. 
The comparative playfulness of the novel could have made this “Hobbit” movie a lot of fun, but over the years Mr. Jackson seems to have shed most of the exuberant, gleefully obnoxious whimsy that can be found in early films like “Meet the Feebles” and “Dead Alive.” A trace of his impish old spirit survives in some of the creature designs in “The Hobbit” — notably a gelatinous and gigantic Great Goblin and an encampment of cretinous, Three-Stooges-like trolls — but Tolkien’s inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle. 
Also, not to be pedantic or anything, but “The Hobbit” is just one book, and its expansion into three movies feels arbitrary and mercenary. This installment takes Bilbo and his companions, led by the exiled dwarf king Thorin (Richard Armitage), son of Thrain, through a series of encounters with orcs, elves, trolls and other beings, some scarier or more charming than others. The only character who manages to be a bit of both is the incomparable Gollum, once again incarnated by Andy Serkis in what remains an unmatched feat of computer-assisted performance. 
The meeting between Bilbo and Gollum, which takes place in a vast, watery subterranean cavern, is the one fully enchanted piece of “An Unexpected Journey.” It’s a funny, haunting and curiously touching moment that summons the audience to a state of quiet, eager attentiveness. Even if you aren’t aware of the apocalyptic importance of Gollum’s precious ring, you feel that a lot is at stake here: Bilbo’s life and integrity; Gollum’s corroded soul; the fate of Middle-earth itself. 
If only some of that feeling animated the rest of the movie. There are, of course, plenty of shots of noble characters turning their eyes portentously toward the horizon, and much talk of honor, betrayal and the rightful sovereignty of dwarfs over their dragon-occupied mountain. But it all sounds remarkably hollow, perhaps because the post-“Lord of the Rings” decade has seen a flood of lavish and self-serious fantasy-movie franchises. We have heard so many weird proper names intoned in made-up tongues, witnessed so many embodiments of pure evil rise and fall and seen so many fine British actors in beards and flowing robes that we may be too jaded for “The Hobbit,” in spite of its noble pedigree. 
But I don’t mean to blame the cultural situation for the specific failings of the movie, which rises to weary, belated mediocrity entirely on its own steam. Mr. Jackson has embraced what might be called theme-park-ride cinema, the default style of commercially anxious, creatively impoverished 3-D moviemaking. The action sequences are exercises in empty, hectic kineticism, with very little sense of peril or surprise. Characters go hurtling down chutes and crumbling mountainsides or else exert themselves in chaotic battles with masses of roaring, rampaging pixels. 
It seems harder and harder to bring any real novelty or excitement to this kind of thing, though it is not clear how much Mr. Jackson really tries. (“Giants! Stone giants!” someone cries, and a couple of mountains dutifully slug it out.) When the initial rush of a chase or a skirmish dissipates, you are left with the slightly ripped-off feeling of having been here before, but with different costumes, in a “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie or “Clash of the Titans.” 
And near the end, when giant birds arrive to pull “The Hobbit” out of the squall and muck of tedious combat, your pleasure at this soaring aerial tour of New Zealand may be accompanied by a shrug of recognition, since the flight plan retraces the routes of “Avatar” and “How to Train Your Dragon.” 
“The Hobbit” is being released in both standard 3-D and in a new, 48-frames-per-second format, which brings the images to an almost hallucinatory level of clarity. This is most impressive and also most jarring at the beginning, when a jolly dwarf invasion of Bilbo’s home turns into a riot of gluttonous garden gnomes. 
Over all, though, the shiny hyper-reality robs Middle-earth of some of its misty, archaic atmosphere, turning it into a gaudy high-definition tourist attraction. But of course it will soon be overrun with eager travelers, many of whom are likely to find the journey less of an adventure than they had expected. 
“The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Mass slaughter of digital monsters. 
‽
‽The Girl‽,‽It takes a stupid crime and an avoidable tragedy to realize that the title of the American independent movie “The Girl” refers to two people. The first is Ashley (Abbie Cornish), a solitary, thorny rose of Texas who lives in a trailer park and punches a clock at a dead-end job. Her manager favors the Latina workers, or so she believes; worse, her young son, Georgie (Austin Wayne West), has been taken away from her. She visits him soon after the story opens, dropping by the foster home where he lives and that, with its tidy lawn and swing set, looks pretty as a picture. It’s a snapshot of the American dream that seems out of her reach and that will bring her and the second girl trouble. 
The dustiness of the southern Texas town and the cramped modesty of Ashley’s trailer serve as a sharp contrast to the foster home that sits nestled in a suggestively alive, sustaining pocket of green. The director David Riker, working from his own script, sets up “The Girl” nicely. There are early flickers of drama, mostly from a social services worker who checks in on Ashley as well as from talk about a court decision that might reunite her with Georgie. Ashley looks and talks angry, yet even with her periodic outbursts — she yells at Georgie’s caretaker that only money separates her from her son — there’s something amorphous about her rage. There’s next to no urgency to her demeanor and, despite the loss of her son, not a lot that feels worryingly at stake. 
If Ashley can’t settle on a target of her anger it’s perhaps because, as Mr. Riker suggests, that would force her to face tough self-truths. Yet while he makes it clear that she bears some responsibility for her situation, he fills in the bleak contours of her world better than he does those of her interior landscape. This limits Ashley, who, despite her frowns, has none of the hard edges that poverty can bring, none of its scars. She often registers as more petulant than wounded, almost spoiled, and also a bit blank. When her father, Tommy (Will Patton), visiting from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, swings by, laughing like a hyena and splashing booze, he gives the movie a jolt. 
The plot thickens when Ashley learns that he has started smuggling people into the United States. Almost as if on a whim, she tries to do the same. Her efforts go calamitously wrong, and she ends up in Mexico caring for a girl, Rosa (Maritza Santiago Hernández), who has been separated from her mother. Rosa wants her mom and Ashley wants to go home, and while Ashley resists Rosa, her resistance isn’t convincing or long lived. Ms. Cornish is a sympathetic presence, and she turns down her mouth a lot here, but her character’s hardness is a thin coat of lacquer and it chips off fast. What at first came across as a tale of dawning conscience increasingly starts to feel rigged. 
Parked on the banks of the Rio Grande, Nuevo Laredo is one of the busiest borders on the continent; it has also unsurprisingly endured horrifying violence over the past decade. In May the corpses of 23 men and women, presumed victims of gang warfare, were found in the city, some without heads, others hanging from a bridge. Ashley’s father may have moved to Nuevo Laredo (another city plays the role here) because of his illegal pursuits, but his cavalier demeanor when he walks its streets and drinks in its bars rings as false as his smuggling. It’s even harder to buy that Ashley would, even with her hard-luck back story, enter into human trafficking with all the furrowed-brow gravity of a woman buying a new pair of huaraches. 
People do stupid things all the time, on screen and off, and her impulsiveness isn’t beyond the bounds of storytelling reason. The larger problem is that Mr. Riker wants to have his social realism and his sentimental uplift too. The shadowy Mexican streets and the desperate people, Ashley’s bitterness and ghastly carelessness with other people’s lives, pull the movie in a direction that evokes the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (“The Son”), with their stories of moral awakenings. The ease with which Ashley surmounts her terrible choices — as well as her voyage deeper into a Mexico where a saint hands out opportune absolution — regrettably tugs the movie elsewhere. You know that place: it’s where the cost of a white character’s new consciousness is paid for by black and brown lives. 
‽
‽The Fitzgerald Family Christmas‽,‽“The Fitzgerald Family Christmas” manages the considerable feat of interweaving the personal dramas of nine members of a boisterous Irish-American clan into a coherent mosaic with a streamlined narrative drive. This meditation on forgiveness in the season of glad tidings may lose some steam as it speeds to very predictable places, but it doesn’t turn into a tear-stained greeting card plastered with tinsel and stale peppermints. 
This comfortably lived-in movie, written and directed by Edward Burns, offers a textbook example of screenwriting concision. Volumes of information and drama are conveyed with minimal dialogue in a tone so relaxed and offhand you hardly notice the painstaking craftsmanship that went into it. 
Mr. Burns shuffles this dense material with the dexterity of a card shark. The pace, although swift, is never rushed. The writing and acting give you vivid enough tastes of the characters — there are seven children, two parents, and assorted spouses, lovers and friends — so that each registers as a singular flavor. 
The ensemble includes some of the same actors from Mr. Burns’s directorial debut in 1995, “The Brothers McMullen,” which won an Independent Spirit Award for best first feature and the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Together, the actors convincingly evoke the familial and social bonds connecting working-class Irish-Catholic Long Islanders. 
If “The Fitzgerald Family Christmas” revisits the world of “The Brothers McMullen,” the names have changed, and Mr. Burns is stouter and ruddier than he was 17 years ago. He plays Gerry Fitzgerald, the self-appointed peacemaker and surrogate father figure of a quarrelsome, high-spirited brood of grown-up children he tries to corral for the 70th birthday of their mother, Rosie (Anita Gillette). That birthday falls two days before Christmas, and Rosie, who doesn’t like birthdays, seems not to mind when her children find reasons not to attend. 
Gerry, his mother’s darling, owns a nearby tavern and has lived at home since an unspecified tragedy related to Sept. 11. Twenty years earlier his father, Jim (Ed Lauter), abandoned the family. Now Jim, who is broke and ailing, is pestering Gerry to persuade Rosie to allow him to join the family for Christmas dinner. When Jim walked out, leaving her to rear the last four of the seven children by herself, she vowed he would never set foot in her home again. 
Rosie may be resilient and feisty, but Ms. Gillette’s wonderful performance recognizes the depth of her stored-up hurt and anger. She is reluctant to believe Jim’s claim that he is dying of pancreatic cancer and has only months to live. 
Besides Gerry, the more sharply etched characters include his new possible sweetheart, Nora (Connie Britton), the serene caregiver for a friend of Rosie’s; and his hot-tempered brother Quinn (Michael McGlone), who fancies younger women. A sister, Sharon (Kerry Bishé), gravitates toward older men, the latest of whom, nicknamed F X (Noah Emmerich), is a wealthy playboy with a house in the Hamptons. 
The others include Gerry’s frightened youngest brother, Cyril (Tom Guiry), who is just out of rehab and faces an uncertain future; his sister Connie (Caitlin Fitzgerald), whose abusive, unemployed partner, J J (Dara Coleman), explodes when she tells him she is pregnant; Erin (Heather Burns), her father’s favorite, who has married outside the Roman Catholic faith; and an imperious oldest sister, Dottie (Marsha Dietlein Bennett), who has left her husband to hook up with her much younger gardener (John Solo). 
The Fitzgeralds’ collective problems aren’t much worse than those of any other large family. And the movie’s attitude is mostly nonjudgmental. Its moral fulcrum is the question only Rosie can answer: Should she allow Jim back into the fold? As that is debated throughout the film, with all points of view taken into account, “The Fitzgerald Family Christmas” addresses the meaning of family ties with a bracing emotional honesty.

‽Farewell to Hollywood‽,‽Rendering a verdict on the cinematic merits of “Farewell to Hollywood” seems beside the point or even inappropriate; the movie’s key attribute is that it exists. The co-director, Regina Nicholson, died of cancer at 19 in 2012. She is shown expressing a wish that the documentary about this period in her life “survive and be fantastic.” 
Mr. Corra eventually became involved in Ms. Nicholson’s medical care. There are passages — especially the finale — that suggest he lacked perspective in editing. The movie continues through several possible closing moments.

‽Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago‽,‽The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, where, legend holds, the Apostle James is buried, has drawn pilgrims since the Middle Ages. So it’s not as if the most popular Camino de Santiago, the 500-mile Camino Francés, which starts at St.-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the Pyrenees, needs any publicity. Still, “The Way,” Emilio Estevez’s 2011 film about four modern-day hikers — one played by his father, Martin Sheen — introduced many to the trek and its meditative pleasures. 
‽
‽Justin Bieber's Believe‽,‽The key moment in “Justin Bieber’s Believe,” the new hagiographical film, comes in the second half, in a segment that touches ever so lightly upon Mr. Bieber’s tumultuous public image over the last year. The scene is London, last March: A small cluster of paparazzi is egging Mr. Bieber on, and he takes the bait, jumping at the photographers and being held back by a bodyguard. At least half of the conversation (on both sides) is bleeped. 
That said, films like this work best when exalting is the task, and when it comes to displaying Mr. Bieber in his milieu — onstage — it shines. The footage is arresting and crisp, and Mr. Bieber is in his element: He’s not the most outgoing pop star, but he has the requisite attitude, and his mild cool comes through clearly. 
If it’s that, then the secondary interviews with Mr. Bieber’s intimates, all of which have just a touch of black cloud hovering overhead, are extra resonant. Scooter Braun, Mr. Bieber’s manager, describes this star’s journey as “a constant search for validation.” Usher speaks of Mr. Bieber’s fans as his “moral compass.” And the producer Rodney Jerkins, while praising Mr. Bieber’s abilities, acknowledges that he has experienced only victory thus far: “He doesn’t really understand what the loss looks like.”  
‽
‽The Wolf of Wall Street‽,‽Future archaeologists, digging through the digital and physical rubble of our long-gone civilization in search of reasons for its collapse, will be greatly helped if they unearth a file containing “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Martin Scorsese’s three-hour bacchanal of sex, drugs and conspicuous consumption. Then as now, the movie is likely to be the subject of intense scholarly debate: Does it offer a sustained and compelling diagnosis of the terminal pathology that afflicts us, or is it an especially florid symptom of the disease? 
After meeting Jordan at his saturnalian peak, we flash back to his beginnings as an eager newbie at a reputable firm, where he is introduced to the mysteries and pleasures of the trade by a gleefully Mephistophelean Matthew McConaughey. This is less a fall from grace than a rite of passage, and after the crash of 1987 flushes Jordan out of the real Wall Street, he finds a way to recreate its worst and most attractive aspects. Taking inspiration from a storefront penny-stock outfit, he conjures up a high-profile company with the fake blue-blood name of Stratton Oakmont. 
Anyway, what makes “The Wolf of Wall Street” a vital and troubling document of the present is not so much Jordan’s business plan — he tells us repeatedly that it’s too complicated and boring to explain — as his approach to life. It’s a truism that every salesman sells himself, and as Stratton Oakmont grows, Jordan becomes an evangelist of easy money and unbridled pleasure. The ambitious brokers who flock to its trading floor are lured by the promise of huge bonuses and endless debauchery, but their enterprise is held together, above all, by the boss’s charisma.  
What they do is consistently appalling and sometimes very funny. The comedy in “The Wolf of Wall Street” can be deliciously brutal — an extended sequence in which Jordan and Donnie are so blitzed on Quaaludes that they can barely move is sure to join Mr. Scorsese’s greatest-hits reel — but the movie laughs with Jordan as well as at him. And, intentionally or not, it makes a fetish of his selfish bad-boy lifestyle. 
‽
‽47 Ronin‽,‽Between the prospect of Hollywood’s sexing up a legendary Japanese story with rampaging C.G.I. monsters and the eager reports of a protracted production, there has been ample opportunity to hobble “47 Ronin” long before its warriors finally emerge in theaters. But say what you will about this fantasy adventure, set in “a land shrouded in mystery” (per the opening voice-over), it’s still a studio movie adaptation of a story that ends — centuries-old spoiler! — with mass ritual suicide. Credit due for that bit of faithfulness, I suppose — and Merry Christmas, by the way. 
Providing fodder for fanciful special effects and 3-D imagery are a shape-shifting witch (Rinko Kikuchi, in an unsteady vamp), who helps Kira using extravagant conjurings, and a back story for Kai in an enchanted forest (apparently named after folkloric creatures called tengu). The lushly designed beasts and careening chases are what you might expect from the film’s director, Carl Rinsch, who is making his feature debut after creating advertising work and a viral short featuring, well, robots and chases. All these flourishes may reflect anxiety over whether the shame- and honor-based narrative would hold the attention of Americans, but they can be diverting. 
There’s a sober pace to this sometimes picturesque film: The dutifully arranged action building blocks and the meager story filler are ploddingly punctuated by landscape shots. But “47 Ronin” can’t entirely paper over the void at its center, traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering. (Reshoots reportedly occurred, with changes including the placement of Mr. Reeves’s character at the center of a climactic battle with a dragon.) 
‽
‽The Secret Life of Walter Mitty‽,‽As imagined by Ben Stiller, Walter Mitty is a man out of step with his time. An archetypal daydreamer introduced to the public by James Thurber as a henpecked suburban husband and later impersonated on screen by Danny Kaye as a misunderstood, starry-eyed sweetheart with a lovely singing voice, Walter has evolved into a modern office drone with an unusually active fantasy life. He is also, in some respects, the opposite of just about every other comic hero in American movies today, including many played by Mr. Stiller. And “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” directed by Mr. Stiller (who takes the title role), has a dreamy, melancholy tone quite different from what you might expect to find in a big-budget holiday comedy.  
It also, somewhat more riskily, tries to fold the kind of playful, wide-eyed high spirits familiar from the “Night at the Museum” movies into what is in effect a midlife melodrama. This is Walter Mitty by way of Marty, the soulful Bronx butcher played by Ernest Borgnine in the 1955 film that won the Oscar for best picture. Walter’s most notable trait is the one that everyone else undervalues or takes for granted: his goodness. Walter is a low-key suitor, and Cheryl is drawn to him for his thoughtfulness and quiet sense of humor rather than for the alpha-male derring-do he secretly possesses. In one funny, poignant scene, he executes a series of impressive skateboard moves — real, not imaginary — while her back is turned. But showing off like that would be out of character in any case. 
‽
‽Grudge Match‽,‽Old jocks never die; they just team up. One veteran action hero may not be able to open a movie nowadays, but put two or more shoulder to shoulder in the same film, as in the “Expendables” series, and there’s gold to be mined and a senior male fan base to be activated. That’s the shrewd marketing philosophy behind “Grudge Match,” the overlong, drab, not-so-funny sports comedy that teams Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro as onetime boxing champions in an unlikely rematch 30 years after their last bout. Rocky versus the Raging Bull; how about that for a tagline?  
What reunites them is a television special about their history that prompts a video game company to use their images. At a promotional event, taunts are exchanged and a fight breaks out. Caught on video, the scene goes viral on YouTube, and public pressure mounts for an actual rematch. Promising big bucks, Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), the son of the promoter who squandered Razor’s earnings, coaxes them back into the game. Standing blankly in the middle of the fray is Sally (Kim Basinger), the blonde who got between Razor and Billy in their glory days.  
“Grudge Match,” directed by Peter Segal (“Get Smart” and the 2005 remake of “The Longest Yard”) from a story by Tim Kelleher, who wrote the screenplay with Rodney Rothman, is more of an outline than a fleshed-out narrative. The back story, especially the romantic part, has no resonance. Ms. Basinger, now 60, is ravishing, but her character registers as little more than a speck in a PowerPoint presentation.  
Programs like Cenegenics and slogans like “70 is the new 50,” not to mention erectile dysfunction medications, now dominate the senior male market in our never-say-die culture. Testosterone rules, as the grunts and bellows of Rocky Balboa and his ilk echo into eternity.

‽Personal Tailor‽,‽“What you don’t dare imagine, we dare to do” is the motto of the dream team known as “Personal Tailor,” a fantasy fabrication service (led by Ge You and Bai Baihe) that provides wealthy clients with a taste of the lives they have always wanted. No request is too outlandish (the “Custom Martyrdom Package” will furnish you with a simulated Nazi interrogation, hunger strike optional) or too elaborate, even if the outcomes are not always as planned.

‽All the Light in the Sky‽,‽The cosmic and the microscopic are casually — and delicately — juxtaposed in “All the Light in the Sky,” an evocative, slightly melancholic movie directed and photographed by the prolific mumblecore auteur Joe Swanberg. This portrait of a middle-aged actress in Los Angeles who makes a decent living as a Hollywood bit player but worries about the future, is bolstered by the astoundingly natural performance of Jane Adams (“Happiness,” “Hung”). Her chipper, articulate character, Marie, is 45 and acutely aware of her professional shelf life. She lives in a comfortable Malibu home on stilts that hugs the Pacific Coast.  
Without preaching, “All the Light in the Sky” poses questions that are worth asking, even if we know the answers. Why do people build houses that they know will eventually be swallowed by the sea? How do we keep up our spirits with the realization that no matter what we do, there is no turning back the clock? Is it possible to deal with the future when it’s all you can do to savor the beauty of the moment?  
‽
‽Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues‽,‽“Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues” is in danger of being overshadowed by its own marketing campaign. The recent media appearances by Ron Burgundy — impersonated, if you need reminding, by Will Ferrell — have the quality of commercial performance art. He has been ubiquitous, hawking Dodge Durango trucks, accepting a tribute from a journalism school and matching wits with members of the profession he exists to lampoon. That television news has so eagerly embraced Ron Burgundy may be evidence that the “Anchorman” movies don’t go far enough, satirically speaking. The man may be a vain, ethically obtuse, generally clueless buffoon, but it would not occur to him to allow a fictional character on his air to sell a product. He’s no George Stephanopoulos. 
It has all stayed classy, even if it’s not such a big deal anymore. This time, as the ’70s shade into the ’80s, offering new wardrobe and song-cue opportunities, Ron and his pals find themselves present for the birth of 24-hour cable news. Ron and his wife, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), have a young son (named Walter, as in Cronkite, played by Judah Nelson), but their relationship hits a snag when she is promoted over him at the network that moved them out of San Diego. Ron, his male pride wounded and his professional dignity challenged, goes into a tailspin that is halted when a cable producer (Dylan Baker) recruits him for a new all-news-all-the-time venture. “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard,” Ron exclaims. That may be the smartest thing he has ever said. 
The movie traces the mythic origins of the worst of modern cable news — the mindless jingoism, the split-screen shouting, the cluttered graphics, the breathless coverage of car chases and celebrity nonsense — to Ron’s initiative. “I’m the one who opened the bottle and let the genie out,” he says proudly. But the whole point of the “Anchorman” franchise has always been that you can’t stay mad at this guy. You can almost imagine — or at least wish — that the real people responsible for the coarsening of civic discourse are just dumb and lovable, rather than greedy and evil. Ron may be sexist, pompous, politically insensitive and hideously dressed, but Mr. Ferrell, with his lumbering frame and twinkling eyes, always tugs him back toward cuddliness.  
Which is not to say that Brick and Chani should have their own movie. Too much of any one thing would spoil the fun of the whole, which depends on quick transitions from one setup to the next and an overall sense of anarchic busyness. “Anchorman 2” supplies that, as expected, even as it also feels like old news.

‽Paradise: Hope‽,‽Hallelujah! Who knew that the Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl actually has a heart? You might not have guessed that if all you have seen of his work are his punishing examinations of bourgeois Austrian life, “Dog Days” (2001) and the first two parts of his “Paradise” trilogy, released this year.  
Anna Maria, who cultivates an imaginary affair with Jesus, prays to the same crucifix with which she masturbates while flagellating herself.  
With an unblinking realism, “Paradise: Hope,” like Mr. Seidl’s previous films, contemplates the tyranny of what is nowadays sometimes referred to as “body fascism” in a society that holds out nearly impossible ideals of beauty and youth. His movies force us to contemplate the weakness of the flesh and our susceptibility to desire with eyes wide open.  
‽
‽American Hustle‽,‽Irving Rosenfeld, the con man running the great scam in “American Hustle,” isn’t, his mistress admits, much to look at. He has a belly the size of a beer keg and a torturously complicated comb-over that he arranges with the fastidiousness of a Michelin-starred pastry chef. Appearances are not everything to Irving (Christian Bale), but rather just part of the swindle that is his life’s work, his passion and genius. The confidence game is his honey pot: It’s what lines his pockets, lights his fire and cigars, and has transformed the mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), into his equal in theft and dissimulation, making her the Rosalind Russell to his Cary Grant in a romp that’s pure Scorsese screwball.  
The movie tracks the scandal primarily from the points of view of Irving and Sydney, whose he-said, she-said voice-overs are interspersed with adenoidal dispatches from his stay-at-home wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). After setting the contemporary scene, Mr. Russell cuts back to Irving’s childhood, sketching in the con man’s background with brief, funny scenes and a devil-may-care take on criminality that pointedly mirrors the trajectory of Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese’s “GoodFellas.” Like Paul Thomas Anderson, whose period bacchanal “Boogie Nights” also borrows from “GoodFellas,” Mr. Russell is a cinematic Son of Scorsese. Yet while his swooping cameras and motor-mouth characters follow in the virtuosic wake of Mr. Scorsese, they’re equally beholden to Mr. Scorsese’s own influences, including the Golden Hollywood likes of the director Raoul Walsh.  
Mr. Scorsese once called Walsh’s 1939 post-World-War-I crime film, “The Roaring Twenties,” a “twisted Horatio Alger story,” a thumbnail description that also fits “American Hustle.” Corrupt politicos and a federal Venus’ flytrap give the movie a veneer of topicality, and there’s plenty in it that matches up with the historical record, including the role played by Irving’s true-crime counterpart, a Bronx-born swindler named Mel Weinberg. Even so, Mr. Russell doesn’t seem all that interested in veracity, and the movie opens with a playful assurance that “some of this actually happened,” a declaration that feels calculated to block off-point objections that some of it didn’t happen. Details have been changed, and everyone, as is often the case in movies, looks younger and prettier, less lumpy and beaten down by life than the original players, even Irving and his magnificently tragic, trumped-up hair. 
Once Irving’s and Sydney’s back stories are set in place, the movie is off and running. The two join forces personally and professionally after meeting at a party where Irving — resplendent in swimming trunks, gold chains nestling in a thatch of chest fur and a stomach that suggests he’s far into his third trimester — works his magic. Mutually smitten, they begin swindling desperate people who, unable to secure legitimate bank loans, hand over wads of cash in hopes of receiving bigger advances. One mark turns out to be an F.B.I. agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper, very good), who uses them to run a bigger con, one he hopes will bag politicians like a New Jersey mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner, excellent), whose decency is tested by his ambitions.  
Or perhaps Mr. Bale found pathos in Irving and dignity in this small, striving, vulgar man’s life. Whatever the reasons, Mr. Bale, like some other stars who embrace playing ugly, feels as if he’d been liberated by all the pounds he’s packed on and by his character’s molting looks, an emancipation that’s most evident in his delicately intimate, moving moments with Ms. Adams and Ms. Lawrence. Hilarious and brassy, by turns reminiscent of Jean Harlow and Judy Holliday, Ms. Lawrence is a bountiful delight even in a smallish role, partly because of her magnetism and partly because Mr. Russell is one of the few American male directors working today who’s as interested in women as he is in men. This may be about a famous federal sting, but, like all of his movies, it’s also a love story (or two).  
As Irving’s other better half, Ms. Adams, a virtuoso of perkiness, goes deeper here than she’s ever been allowed to. She showed an indelibly darker, more dangerous side in a supporting role in Mr. Anderson’s “Master,” playing Lady Macbeth to a cult leader; she has a lot more to do in “American Hustle.” Like Irving, Sydney is a self-invention, one containing multitudes, from the former stripper she starts off as, to the elegant British noblewoman she pretends to be for the couple’s loan scams. With her bright eyes and alabaster gleam, Ms. Adams can look like a porcelain doll, a deceptive mien that helps complicate Sydney and turns an unpredictable character into a thrillingly wild one, whose ordinary scream is the howl of a wolf.  
‽
‽The President‽,‽The Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf (“A Moment of Innocence,” “Kandahar”) is not known for his kineticism, but “The President” — which he has suggested is his comment on the Arab Spring — has surprising urgency and sweep. The film is set in an unknown country (everyone speaks Georgian), where a dictator (Misha Gomiashvili) thinks nothing of approving a teenager’s execution in front of his grandson (Dachi Orvelashvili), who looks to be about 5. He then invites the child to play a game: They’ll turn the power on and off in the city below the presidential palace. 
Suddenly, revolution erupts. With the rest of the family evacuated, the two find themselves in continual danger. Some of the strongest filmmaking occurs in the first half-hour, as Mr. Makhmalbaf trails the presidential limousine through riots, bullets and flames. Soon, with a bounty on his head, the president burns his uniform, trims his hair and dons a wig, passing himself and his grandson off as street musicians. 
At times — as when a soldier under the new regime rapes a bride in her wedding dress — the movie flirts with a false equivalence, suggesting that postrevolutionary life is just as cruel as totalitarianism. The actual moral of the story is more trite and utopian, but still powerful: Democracy can’t take root until the impulse for vengeance is gone. 
‽
‽The Hand That Feeds‽,‽Films about labor relations don’t always need the massive scale of “Harlan County, U.S.A.” (1976), which watched a miners’ strike unfold. The advocacy documentary “The Hand That Feeds” chronicles organizing efforts at a Hot &amp; Crusty on Second Avenue at 63rd Street in Manhattan. (Some material shot for the film was adapted into a New York Times Op-Doc in 2013.)

‽Barbecue‽,‽Eric Lavaine’s “Barbecue,” a French comedy about a circle of middle-age friends facing mild irritations, is the kind of utterly unremarkable local product that doesn’t usually get an American release. But its loosely written story doubles as a smirk-inducing glimpse at what feel like very Gallic life challenges. 
But Mr. Wilson’s Antoine is too much of a pill to root for, and the voice-over and wispy songs dribbling over scenes only underline the forgettable filmmaking. But hurrah for the use of a game of pétanque (pronounced pay-TONK, it’s a lawn game akin to Italian bocce ball) to illustrate the joie de vivre of a woman separated from her husband.  
‽
‽Into the Woods‽,‽“Into the Woods,” the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for “children of all ages.” That usually translates to mean only children and their doting parents. But with “Into the Woods,” you grow up with the characters, young and old, in a lifelong process of self-discovery. 
Mr. Sondheim’s great song “No One Is Alone” is a double-edged lullaby. It acknowledges that everyone is ultimately alone, although the shared understanding of that isolation makes life bearable. 
The movie shows remarkably few signs of the sweetening and dumbing down that might have been expected, given the Disney factory’s philosophy of gratifying wishes but adding just enough darkness to make the light seem brighter. I suspect that the success of “Frozen” may have persuaded the company to modify its traditional formulas to allow more realism and ambiguity, which is all to the good. 
Rapunzel and the witch are not the movie’s only parent and child in conflict. Jack and his strict mother (Tracey Ullman), irate that he traded a cow for some magic beans, are continually at odds. The characters closest to their fairy tale origins are Cinderella’s stepmother (Christine Baranski) and stepsisters, Florinda (Tammy Blanchard) and Lucinda (Lucy Punch). With the exception of the giant and a wolf (a sensational Johnny Depp) who stalks and devours Little Red Riding Hood, these mean girls and their avaricious mom are the only genuine baddies. 
Everyone else is shaded somewhere between good and evil. Even Ms. Streep’s vindictive hag is not entirely wicked. When a curse is lifted, and her beauty is restored, she is a dead ringer for Miranda Priestly, Ms. Streep’s regal fashion maven in “The Devil Wears Prada.” Ms. Streep’s warm performance gives the witch, even at her most fearsome, a twinkle of good humor that draws you to her. And her climactic meltdown, “Last Midnight,” is a vocal and dramatic tour de force. 
And “Children Will Listen” distills what might be called the gospel according to Sondheim: 
‽
‽The Gambler‽,‽In “The Gambler,” a movie about a guy who’s a glutton for criminally high stakes and for punishment, a skeletonized Mark Wahlberg wears a mop of greasy hair and an abject look. In some scenes, he looks crushed and lost, like a wadded scrap of paper that fell short of the garbage bin. It soon becomes clear why. His character, Jim Bennett, hit the literary jackpot years ago with a well-received first and only published novel. Now Jim splits his time between teaching college — say hello to Professor Wahlberg — and betting and losing at gaming tables, some in underworld parlors around a Los Angeles that’s been Michael Mann-ed into a smear of throbbing color and would-be existential dread.  
“The Gambler” is based on the terrific lowdown and gritty 1974 movie of the same title starring James Caan. That film was beautifully directed by Karel Reisz from James Toback’s script about his experience as a gambler and college lecturer; the new one was directed by Rupert Wyatt from a screenplay by William Monahan, who also wrote Martin Scorsese’s Academy Award windfall “The Departed.” Without a script in hand, it’s tough to tell how significant a contribution a writer makes to a movie, what was retained or changed from page to screen. All that’s clear in this “Gambler” is that almost everything that makes the original so pleasurably idiosyncratic, from its daft ideas to the peekaboo bear rug spread over Mr. Caan’s often-bared chest, has been expunged from the remake.  
The story mostly involves Jim’s consuming passion with gambling and, in a quasi-Freudian move, learning to transfer that libidinous energy to a dubiously healthier object, in this case one of his young students, Amy (an underused Brie Larson). Mr. Monahan may have lifted the teacher-student liaison from Dostoyevsky’s biography and novelist’s relationship with a much younger woman. That’s moderately interesting, but it doesn’t mean anything for Amy (or Ms. Larson), who does little more than look intently at Jim when he’s jumping around the lecture hall or laying down some heavy thoughts. Ms. Larson holds your eyes and interest, but she’s as ornamental as the stick figure played by Lauren Hutton in the 1974 film.  
Mr. Wyatt’s direction is smooth, although he’s more confident, and the movie more convincing, when he goes for baroque with the story’s excesses, like cutting loose with the cartoonish villains played by Alvin Ing, Jessica Lange, Michael Kenneth Williams and John Goodman. The problem is that Jim (and Mr. Wahlberg) never joins the fun. A congenitally likable screen presence, Mr. Wahlberg handles the movie’s streaming words like the rapper he once was, and he sometimes cocks an eyebrow as if acknowledging the absurdity of it all. Mostly, his character is sad, sincere and heavy, and his performance is, too, even when Jim whips out some eyeglasses the first time he enters his classroom. When Marilyn Monroe pulled that kind of stunt it was comedy gold, but it just makes Jim and Mr. Wahlberg look silly.  
‽
‽Big Eyes‽,‽A horror movie tucked inside a domestic drama wrapped up in a biopic, Tim Burton’s “Big Eyes” tells the story of Margaret Keane, an artist whose characteristic style is summed up in the title. 
How this arrangement came about — and how it fell apart — is Mr. Burton’s main concern. Margaret arrives in San Francisco in flight from a bad first marriage, accompanied by her daughter, Jane (Delaney Raye as a young child, Madeleine Arthur as a teenager). The world is an unfriendly place for a single mother, and the city, shot in bright, saturated colors (by Bruno Delbonnel), has a lurid creepiness that suggests Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” an impression underlined by Ms. Adams’s blond, slightly chilly vulnerability. 
Walter Keane, speaking of creeps, seems at first to be an ebullient, free-spirited charmer. He seems that way to Margaret, anyway. The rest of us, recognizing Christoph Waltz, will suspect other, less amusing dimensions to the character. A Sunday painter who claims to have studied in Paris, Walter, who works in commercial real estate, encourages Margaret’s creativity and offers security for her and Jane, whose father is threatening to sue for custody. The new couple exhibit their work in a nightclub (owned by the great scene-stealer Jon Polito), and when Margaret’s forlorn children attract more attention than Walter’s Parisian street scenes, he starts to claim them as his own. 
Walter is a mediocre artist — if that — but he does have a genius for self-promotion. Intuiting the Warholian spirit of the times, he pushes the boundary between art and commerce, turning his surname and his wife’s talent into a powerful and ubiquitous brand. He is helped by a gullible newspaper columnist played by Danny Huston. Though “Big Eyes” is entirely on Margaret’s side, especially as her husband’s sadistic, controlling behavior comes to the forefront, it depends on Walter’s manic, devilish energy. Ms. Adams’s performance is sensitive and subtle, but the film can’t quite figure out what to do with her character’s passivity. Trying to do Margaret justice, Mr. Burton can’t prevent himself (and Mr. Waltz) from upstaging her. 
A more intriguing ambiguity has to do with the value of Margaret’s work. Terence Stamp shows up briefly as John Canaday, a real-life New York Times critic who attacked the selection of a large-scale Keane painting called “Tomorrow Forever” for the 1964 World’s Fair. Canaday (a Kansas native here depicted as an imperious patrician with an ascot and a British accent) exposed Walter Keane’s hucksterism but also trashed Margaret’s art as “the very definition of tasteless hack work.” 
Is that judgment altered by the knowledge that the paintings, rather than emerging from a self-promoting man’s supposed encounters with orphans in postwar Berlin, sprung from the unconscious of a self-effacing woman? This is not a simple question, and it is one that Mr. Burton toys with to intriguing effect. In his magnificent “Ed Wood,” the director cast a sympathetic eye on a widely reviled filmmaker, exploring the ambition and integrity behind some of the worst movies ever made. 
‽
‽Unbroken‽,‽Angelina Jolie opens “Unbroken” with a shot of a celestial blue sky that soon darkens with a battle scene so tense and fluidly choreographed that you quickly sense that, as a director, she leans closer to hell than heaven. She has given herself plenty to work with: The movie takes a slice out of the life of Louis Zamperini, the Olympic runner turned World War II bombardier who, after surviving a plane crash and 47 days adrift on the Pacific, was fished out of the water by a Japanese patrol boat and then imprisoned in camps where he was brutalized for years. His is one of those stories that has come to define the Greatest Generation.  
Ms. Jolie is a fast worker. After her inaugural nod at the wide blue yonder, she thrusts you inside the claustrophobic confines of a B-24 bomber that’s soon under Japanese attack. There, the adult Louie, as he was called, bounces through the plane while bullets begin shredding its exterior and soon its occupants, the fusillade opening little circles of light in the hull as effortlessly as a pencil punches holes in paper. It’s a shrewd opener, because it immediately puts you on notice in regard to the story’s life-and-death stakes and draws you close to Louie (the appealing Jack O’Connell). Mr. Zamperini was a distance runner, but here he’s a sprinter whose quicksilver movements — he crouches and scuttles while tending the wounded plane and men — suck you in with gravitational force.  
Louie’s life moves so rapidly here that about 30 minutes after the movie’s start, he’s running laps at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. There, he catches a glimpse of Jesse Owens and gawps at the cheering crowds and bloated Nazi spectacle, which Ms. Jolie conveys with digital effects and a touch of Leni Riefenstahl pomp-and-creepiness. Then Louie’s off to the races, and we’re off to something of a narrative cheat. He scores mightily on the track — with a rabbity final sprint — but Ms. Jolie pumps the inspirational uplift so high that with all the soaring music, swirling camerawork, excited commentary and slow-motion shots of Louie’s straining and gasping you may not realize he didn’t win any Olympic medals.  
It took four marquee writers — Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson — to wrestle Ms. Hillenbrand’s many pages into a movie, which clocks in at 2 hours 17 minutes. That’s scarcely enough time for any life, but it’s impossible when each chapter in that life could itself be a book (including an underplayed epiphany), and the strain shows, especially in the camp sequences. Ms. Jolie does fine work throughout, including on the raft where, after the crash, Louie and two others, Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock), battle dehydration, starvation and sharks, including one that the men, in a jolting scene, wrestle onboard and devour. Like a lot of actors turned directors, she’s good with the performers, even when platitudes gush from their mouths along with the blood.  
“Unbroken” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). War violence and crimes. 
‽
‽Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb‽,‽“Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb” signifies closing time for the franchise in which exhibits come alive, and Ben Stiller has to deal with them. The director, Shawn Levy, and the new writers, David Guion and Michael Handelman, throw together enough gags and one-liners to ensure a diverting and, here and there, rather funny journey for the museum stalwart Larry and his menagerie of Teddy Roosevelt, a miniature Roman general, a Neanderthal, a capuchin monkey and others. 
Now director of nighttime operations, Larry (Mr. Stiller, near left) must visit a pharaoh (Ben Kingsley!) in the British Museum to learn why Roosevelt and friends went bonkers during a dinner show at the American Museum of Natural History. The problems center on an enchanted Egyptian tablet tied to the animation of the exhibits. The trip introduces new blood to the comedy, chiefly a revived Sir Lancelot (a sharp Dan Stevens, far left) and a gabby British nightwatchwoman (Rebel Wilson), and Larry’s travails with his college-averse son yield lessons about independence. 
It’s a chronically underachieving movie, but relatively amusing in its quaint wish fulfillment. 
‽
‽Annie‽,‽Quvenzhané Wallis is a born movie star, with charisma to burn and a rare ability to magnetize an audience’s attention. She showed as much in “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” filmed when she was just 6. In “Annie” she is older and taller, less pixieish and closer to the awkwardness of adolescence, but, if anything, her ability to charm has only increased. Unfortunately, it isn’t enough. 
The narrative and emotional architecture of a much loved, frequently revived, maybe-not-quite-as-great-as-you-remember-it show has been reduced to a chaotic shambles. “It’s the Hard-Knock Life” can still lodge itself in your head, and “Tomorrow” retains the power to dampen your eyes, but the way these and other numbers are arranged, choreographed and edited undermines their effectiveness. A movie musical is more than a bunch of actors lip-syncing on camera, but “Annie” is barely even that. The voices sound thin and flat. The mouths don’t move in time with the music. The dancing is a chaotic stew of flailing limbs. Numbers that are supposed to lift you out of the story into a realm of giddy wonder and pure feeling have the opposite effect. You just wish they would end. 
When the singing stops, a few slightly more amusing things happen. The high point is a movie-within-the-movie, a blissfully silly sendup of the “Twilight” franchise that provides “Annie” with its only moment of genuine inspiration. Otherwise, Mr. Foxx and Ms. Wallis seem to have a nice time together, like people making the best of a long flight by playing a few hands of gin rummy. 
In Harold Gray’s original “Little Orphan Annie” comic strip, Warbucks was also an avatar of anti-New Deal conservatism, his charity an alternative to the policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. In the recessionary 1970s, the Broadway musical (adapted for the screen by John Huston in 1982) made room for Roosevelt and ended on a note of harmony between government and private enterprise. 
I suppose a family entertainment needs to play it safe and avoid inflaming any public sensitivities. But there is a long list of movies, musical and otherwise, that are both engaging and engaged. The new “Annie” is neither. Instead of treated, we’ve been tricked. 
‽
‽The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies‽,‽“You are only quite a little fellow in a wide world, after all,” Gandalf reminds his companion at the end of “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.” The avuncular line has a cozy feel that evokes the bedtime-storytelling of J. R. R. Tolkien’s 1937 children’s classic — now better known as the trilogized prequel to a 21st-century fantasy phenomenon. Gandalf’s sentiment is also all too apt for Peter Jackson’s vexing conclusion to his oddly apportioned adaptation: Bilbo Baggins is indeed quite a little fellow in Mr. Jackson’s wide world here — less a central hero on a quest than a supporting player in a film bookended by destruction and war in gray, grim lands. 
When the Dwarfs, Elves and Orcs — those dumpy, evil forces that appear constantly to need the direction from their rabble-rousing leaders to go forth and “slay them all” — finally engage, Mr. Jackson’s massed set pieces shift between stirring visual salvos and general panoramic swarming. It’s only as individual good guys peel off for death-defying face-offs with Orcs on ledges that the routine violence crackles again with genuine danger and deft showmanship. 
‽
‽Top Five‽,‽In Chris Rock’s fast and blisteringly funny “Top Five” — a romantic comedy that’s also an extended riff on art, identity, authenticity and what it means to be a black entertainer — Mr. Rock plays Andre Allen, a comic in crisis. A stand-up star turned movie-franchise brand, Andre has climbed to the top of the box office playing Hammy, a kind of “Lethal Weapon” enforcer in a bear suit with a gun and a Schwarzenegger-style tag line: “It’s Hammy time!” (The words “600 million worldwide” are stamped on a movie trailer in blood-red letters.) Now, though, Andre is trying to get serious with “Uprize!,” a painfully misbegotten historical drama in which he plays a Haitian slave revolutionary.  
The movie opens with Andre trying to publicize “Uprize!,” which is about to hit (and flop). Shooting in New York, Mr. Rock, who wrote and directed “Top Five,” sets the scene at warp speed with a compressed career retrospective that fills in Andre’s history, his greatest hits and current aspirations. Charlie Rose, playing himself, pops by briefly and early to solidify Andre’s place in the rarified celebrity firmament. Time magazine, Mr. Rose explains, anointed Andre the funniest man in America, an honor that’s soon slyly undercut when a fan asks Andre when the next Hammy movie hits. “I don’t feel like doing funny movies anymore,” Andre says later, “I don’t feel funny.” Given how funny the movie and Andre both are, Mr. Rock makes it tough to take this lament seriously.  
Comics — they (still) don’t get no respect! In some ways, “Top Five” revisits the question of art and its uses that merrily hums through Preston Sturges’s “Sullivan’s Travels” (1941), about a director who wants his next picture to be “a true canvas of the suffering of humanity.” In “Stardust Memories” (1980), Woody Allen’s woebegone pastiche of “8 ½,” Mr. Allen plays Sandy Bates, a director troubled by a similar crisis in comedic faith. “I don’t feel funny,” Bates says. “I look around the world, and all I see is human suffering.” When Bates shows some executives his latest film, one asks, “Doesn’t the man know that he has the greatest gift that anyone can have — the gift of laughter?”  
One of the ideas that Mr. Rock teases throughout “Top Five” is whether the stakes are different when the funnyman with that gift is black. That becomes prime fodder for the interview that Andre does with Chelsea Brown (a wonderful Rosario Dawson), a reporter for The New York Times assigned to write a profile of him. Wearing a brimmed hat that she might have borrowed from Annie Hall, Chelsea is rapidly transformed from Andre’s interrogator — he berates her for asking hack questions — into his inevitable romantic foil. Initially accompanied by Andre’s entourage, including his friend and body man, Silk (JB Smoove, superb), the two break free and begin walking and talking through a New York that’s seductively romantic, partly because it’s grounded in real ideas about how we live now.  
Andre may be the main attraction, but Mr. Rock’s generosity as a filmmaker here means that Chelsea has plenty to say and do. Beat for beat, laugh for laugh, Ms. Dawson fluidly keeps pace with Mr. Rock, whether their characters are arguing about multiculturalism or revisiting Andre’s career highs and hilarious, horrible lows, one of which is recounted in a gaspingly funny, raunchy flashback with a fantastic Cedric the Entertainer. Mr. Rock’s acknowledged debt to Richard Linklater’s peripatetic “Before” triptych is evident in all the two-shots of Andre and Chelsea walking and talking, but also in how it’s a given from the start that they’re equals. Chelsea gives as good as she gets, yet never at the expense of Andre’s other love interest, Erica (Gabrielle Union), a reality-television star.  
Mr. Rock has far more on his mind than a catfight. In “Top Five,” he sifts through — with on-point jokes, boisterous slapstick, affecting honesty and a sharply honed and earned sense of history — issues of artificiality and authenticity, the spectacle of black celebrity and the imperative of personal meaning. Andre has become famous by playing Hammy the Bear, a character that completely obscures his blackness and his maleness. Both Hammy and the Haitian revolutionary represent two familiar — and Mr. Rock seems to suggest — permitted modes of black expression: clowning and suffering. In setting Andre on his search for self, Mr. Rock has carved out a third way, in the process creating a black character who’s fully human and a comedy that’s wholly a blast.

‽The Captive‽,‽Almost everything in “The Captive” looks pale and exhausted, not just the flat interiors and the wan women at its center. Even the film’s villain — a grinning, Mozart-loving skeeve who, when a young girl goes missing, should be the prime suspect on appearance alone — moves as if his aberrant behavior were more trouble than it’s worth. 
“The Captive” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Not a single unsavory moment, unless you count the bad guy’s opera singing.

‽Skating to New York‽,‽In “Skating to New York,” four Canadian high school friends and a kid brother spend one of the coldest days of the year trying to skate roughly 25 miles across Lake Ontario, frozen over for the first time in decades. Hoping to become local legends, they meet ice fishermen and smugglers, battle the elements and hypothermia. But it’s what they’re leaving behind — and what they’ll return to — that’s the real story. 
“Skating to New York” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), for hockey violence and tart language. Those Canadians. 
‽
‽Expelled‽,‽Demographically, the high school caper “Expelled” has some curiosity value because it features Cameron Dallas, who has over six million followers on Vine, the video-sharing service. But comedically, this film about a prankster who is finally thrown out of school does not represent the debut of a great talent, whether in front of or behind the camera. 
“Expelled” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some crude language. 
‽
‽The Pyramid‽,‽In “The Pyramid,” an archaeological team and a documentary crew get stuck in an ancient Egyptian tomb that is armed with booby traps and protected by feral, inbred cats. Clearly, this is not a situation to which logic applies. The movie nevertheless adds a veneer of realism, setting the action during the unrest of August 2013.  
A father-daughter archaeologist pair, Miles (Denis O’Hare) and Nora (Ashley Hinshaw), share exposition duties, reading the hieroglyphics to understand what might be down there. (Miles pleads with everyone not to use the word “curse.”) The answers aren’t satisfying, and “The Pyramid,” despite an unpretentious matinee vibe, is mostly interesting in seeing how little light can be on screen before a bare minimum of suspense and coherence dissipates. There is, truly, not much to see in this movie. 
‽
‽The Foxy Merkins‽,‽Margaret (Lisa Haas), the heroine of Madeleine Olnek’s sly, loose-jointed satire “The Foxy Merkins,” is probably no one’s idea of a lesbian prostitute, or a midnight cowgirl. Brand-new to New York, the stocky, bespectacled Margaret camps out in a restroom in the Port Authority Bus Terminal, where she sleeps, wrapped in clear plastic. But as she wanders the city, she is avidly cruised by closeted suburban women who ogle from their car windows and do double takes when they pass her on the sidewalk.

‽Take Care‽,‽“You get dramatic sometimes,” Devon says to his ex-girlfriend Frannie, in the mildly amusing rom-com “Take Care.” 
‽
‽Among the Believers‽,‽“Once we train their minds, they’ll never change until they die,” the dean of the Red Mosque madrasa says casually and, for the viewer, chillingly, in “Among the Believers.” 
The film, directed by Hemal Trivedi and Mohammed Ali Naqvi, revolves around interviews with Abdul Aziz, a cleric and leader of the Red Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, which indoctrinates thousands of students at its Islamic schools. Mr. Aziz is not shy when discussing his goal of imposing Shariah law on the country. Though the mosque has sometimes been subjected to government crackdowns (including a violent siege in 2007), those only strengthen Mr. Aziz’s conviction. 
The directors let their subjects speak without overtly passing judgment. And while it is maddening to see the aversion to open-minded education by Mr. Aziz (“‘Progressive thought’ is dying,” he declares, pleased), we also see the stark poverty that leaves others with few choices but to follow him. 
‽
‽Olympic Pride, American Prejudice‽,‽The Olympic Games have never been immune from politics, and they certainly weren’t in 1936, when Berlin was the host city and Hitler sought to present the Third Reich in a flattering light. That the United States thwarted him is largely because of the black athletes who receive their due in Deborah Riley Draper’s deft and comprehensive documentary “Olympic Pride, American Prejudice.” As the movie makes clear, racial politics played a major role, both domestically and abroad. 
The villain here is Avery Brundage, the United States Olympic Association president, who trusted the Nazis’ vow to include a Jew on their team (they later reneged) and who dropped the American team’s two Jewish members before a track event Hitler attended. 
‽
‽A Space Program‽,‽“The Martian,” Ridley Scott’s big-budget Hollywood adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel, gave a sense of how a state-of-the-art mission to the red planet might look. Now “A Space Program” offers a decidedly low-tech alternative. 
The installation itself paid homage to 20th-century engineering and applied science. From NASA identity cards to excursion module to land vehicle, the Mars project created the components for Mission Control and each phase of the journey out of steel and plywood and found objects. Spacesuits, for example, were made from the Tyvek of many an overnight mailing envelope. “Our space program is handmade,” Mr. Sachs explains, “guided by the philosophy of bricolage.” 
Whatever else the film carries, it packs some serious whimsy. The Mars landing is handled by an astronaut successfully completing an ancient Atari video game; planetary explorations to gather and dispatch samples feature a handsaw and bottle rockets. Displaying primitive ingenuity, the movie recalls Georges Méliès and the early days of cinema. And as a tribute to NASA, “A Space Program” is rich in the core elements that have always propelled humanity’s flights of fancy: imagination and the right tools. 
‽
‽Other People's Children‽,‽“Other People’s Children,” a painfully hackneyed first feature by the director Liz Hinlein, is doomed from the outset by its wearisome heroine, Sam (Diane Marshall-Green). Appearing in almost every scene, Sam — a filmmaker who has “victim” practically stenciled on her forehead — drifts vapidly through downtown Los Angeles, trying to untangle her feelings about her recently deceased father by engaging in mindless sex and binge drinking. 
‽
‽Point Break‽,‽ 
Ms. Bigelow’s California-focused original is about an agent named Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) who infiltrates a surfer crime ring run by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Here, the Australian actor Luke Bracey plays Johnny, and Bodhi (an uncompelling Édgar Ramírez) leads an enlightened gang of extreme-sports enthusiasts instead of a crime ring. 
Make sense? No? That’s fine, really, because the less you try to parse the group’s rationale, the better. The appeal of this “Point Break” is its high drama (the stunts), and definitely not its dramatic filler: Johnny getting flak from his F.B.I. handler (Ray Winstone), or Bodhi and his lone female comrade (Teresa Palmer) intoning slogans that could be ads for organic cereal (“Read the flow”). 
It’s the globe-trotting feats that make the grade. These set pieces feel a bit more like appreciations of extreme sports than action-movie sequences, but the climax — a wingsuited flight down an Alpine canyon wall partly shot with body cameras — puts to shame your average frictionless superhero aerial acrobatics (even if Johnny and friends look like flying squirrels in sleeping bags while doing it). 
‽
‽The Hateful Eight‽,‽Quentin Tarantino is a scholar of old movies with a particular antiquarian fetish for the ways they used to be made and consumed. His eighth feature, “The Hateful Eight,” was shot on film with antique lenses and is being projected at some theaters in sumptuous, wide-screen 70-millimeter Panavision. 
Though “Hateful Eight” takes place in a hermetic and familiar cinematic universe, it also, like “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained” before it, has more than just the history of cinema on its mind. It shares with those movies an impulse to imagine how the fantasy world of film genres might intersect with the cruelty of real-world history and offer a kind of belated symbolic redress. The winking and filibustering are undertaken with the serious intent of collecting make-believe payback for actual wrongs. This is an ethically tricky, artistically risky undertaking, but in Mr. Tarantino’s hands, it is never not interesting. 
Mr. Tarantino rewrites this tradition by casting Mr. Jackson as Marquis Warren, who wears a blue United States Army major’s uniform and carries with him a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Currently employed, like so many Tarantino heroes, as a bounty hunter, Marquis is well aware that neither his service record nor his connection to the martyred president will secure his dignity or protect him from bigotry. Before long, racial epithets and threats of harm are coming his way from all directions. 
In Mr. Tarantino’s world, hostility and camaraderie are close neighbors. Marquis encounters the friendly, grizzled face of John Ruth (Mr. Russell), a colleague in the business of pursuing miscreants. They have different approaches to the job, in particular the “dead or alive” part. Marquis prefers the first option, but John, known as the Hangman, believes in delivering his quarry to the proper authorities more or less intact. And so he is in the company of a live prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who takes an instant dislike to Marquis. 
Unfortunately, it knows just what to do with Ms. Leigh’s Daisy, who enters the film with a black eye and exits it — well, I guess I’d better not reveal much more. Suffice it to say that she is the film’s scapegoat and punching bag and, above all, its excuse for its own imaginative failures. At a certain point, the n-word gives way to the b-word as the dominant hateful epithet, and “The Hateful Eight” mutates from an exploration of racial animus into an orgy of elaborately justified misogyny. The final scenes wrap up this shaggy-dog story with a nasty punch line, delivering on the promise of the film’s title. I won’t spoil it. See for yourself. 
‽
‽TransFatty Lives‽,‽Some films, blogs and other chronicles that document the course of a fatal disease adopt a purpose or point of view — the dying subject wants to raise awareness, convey a spiritual insight, teach others how to cope with the same illness, or whatever. Patrick Sean O’Brien’s “TransFatty Lives,” in which he records his own deterioration from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, seems determined not to be pigeonholed in that fashion. That makes it refreshingly unpredictable but also frustrating. 
‽
‽Joy‽,‽On paper, David O. Russell’s new film, “Joy,” looks perfectly straightforward, even square. It’s a bootstrap-capitalist fable, a tale of adversity overcome and rags exchanged for riches, a case study in success suitable for a self-improvement seminar. 
Like Micky Ward, the striving pug played by Mark Wahlberg in that movie, Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself thwarted and undermined by her own family. In the film’s opening scenes, her various relations nearly erase her altogether, blocking Ms. Lawrence’s quiet incandescence with ugliness and noise. The divorced mother of two young children, Joy left college when her parents split up and now contends daily with a small army of needy narcissists. Her mother, Terry (Virginia Madsen), lies in bed all day watching a soap opera (a fake one that Mr. Russell has cast with real-life soap opera stars). Rudy (Robert De Niro), Terry’s ex-husband, acts like a helpless child when he’s single and like an entitled patriarch when there’s a woman in his life. Joy also has a passive-aggressive sister (Elisabeth Rohm) and an ex-husband of her own, who is living in her basement until his singing career takes off. 
All of this information is conveyed in Mr. Russell’s breathless, breakneck style. The camera never stops moving, the people never shut up, and the resulting buzz is both stimulating and enervating. There are a few bright spots and calm moments in Joy’s drab, frenetic life. Her grandmother, Mimi (Diane Ladd), believes in her (and provides benevolent voice-over narration). Joy’s ex, Tony (Édgar Ramírez), is actually a pretty nice guy and is able, like Amy Adams’s character in “The Fighter,” to be an ally against the familial back stabbers. 
It’s not so easy, of course. And if “Joy” seems to move toward a foreordained conclusion, it zigzags and covers its tracks along the way, sending its heroine on a roller-coaster ride of raised hopes and brutal disappointments and playing tricks with the audience’s expectations. What kind of spark will ignite between Joy and Neil Walker, a big shot in the world of home-shopping cable television? Since he’s played by Bradley Cooper, the answer could be anything. 
And Mr. Russell gives this meat-and-potatoes parable of upward mobility, set in the early 1990s, a children’s-book quality. I don’t mean that the story is simplified, but rather that its magical, improbable and cruel elements are heavily underlined, so that Joy feels more like a princess laboring under a terrible spell than like a struggling working-class mother. The trolls, witches and ogres she must beguile and vanquish are, for the most part, her own kin. She is, like a fairy-tale hero or heroine, on a long and complicated quest, relying on spells and charms as well as her innate goodness to deliver her. 
It can be argued that Ms. Lawrence is miscast, that she’s too young, too glamorous, insufficiently dented by life’s hard knocks. It can also be argued: So what? Joy’s Cinderella qualities suit her perfectly, and she has the rare ability to combine radiance with realism. Like some of the great screen goddesses of old — for some reason, Lauren Bacall seems like the best point of comparison — she seems at once impossibly magnetic and completely down to earth, regal and democratic, ordinary and perfect. 
‽
‽Concussion‽,‽The sickening crunch of football players crashing against each other, helmet to helmet, echoes through “Concussion” like an alarm. There’s another appalling sound here, too, created by the collision of corporate avarice — in the blurred form of the National Football League — and a doctor fighting a righteous fight. 
What Dr. Omalu discovered were splotches called tau proteins and a progressive degenerative brain disease. (Misshapen tau proteins are also associated with Alzheimer’s disease.) As Jeanne Marie Laskas explains in a sympathetic, no-nonsense 2009 GQ profile of Dr. Omalu, a buildup of tau proteins had done a horrific number on Mr. Webster’s brain. “Tau was kind of like sludge, clogging up the works, killing cells in regions responsible for mood, emotions” and executive functioning, as Ms. Laskas puts it. “This is why Mike Webster was crazy.” Dr. Omalu diagnosed Mr. Webster with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., three letters that have — through scientific studies, news reports and lawsuits — become inextricably connected with three others: N.F.L. 
“Concussion” charts the diagnosis Dr. Omalu made and the ensuing fight both to force the N.F.L. to publicly acknowledge the truth of his findings and to do something to prevent C.T.E. It also gives Dr. Omalu a blandly tasteful Hollywood makeover. Working from Ms. Laskas’s magazine profile, the writer-director Peter Landesman takes the doctor’s discovery and turns it into a hero’s journey with Bennet forced to trudge past some awfully familiar professional and personal signposts. While some of these milestone moments add detail and shading — namely any scene involving Albert Brooks, who periodically drops by to goose the movie to life as Bennet’s boss — others are too off-the-shelf generic to be of use, including those with Bennet’s eventual wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). 
‽
‽Daddy's Home‽,‽“Daddy’s Home” is an ugly psychological cockfight posing as a family-friendly comedy. Laugh-free — except for some farcical, life-threatening stunts at the expense of Will Ferrell’s character, Brad — it is best avoided unless a movie that has the attitude and mind-set of a schoolyard bully happens to be your thing. 
The movie, directed by Sean Anders (“Horrible Bosses 2”), from a screenplay he wrote with Brian Burns and John Morris, is a cruel, muscle-flexing fantasy of domination and emasculation. Early on, it is revealed that Brad has been infertile since an accident (shown in flashback) involving an X-ray machine in a dentist’s office. Dusty slyly informs him that Sarah would like to have another child, and persuades Brad to see an endocrinologist (Bobby Cannavale), who crudely compares the two dads’ private parts. 
Dusty initiates a competition with Brad in which he wins every round, all the while refusing to acknowledge that they are competing. He wows the kids by building a treehouse with an attached skateboarding ramp, which he navigates like a pro. He bribes them with cash and introduces them to sports heroes. Brad remains unflappably good-natured until he can’t take it anymore and has an excruciating public meltdown. 
‽
‽Mr. Six‽,‽Mr. Six is a grumpy old fixture on his Beijing back street, ready to scold or shoot a withering look. But as we are frequently reminded in the director Guan Hu’s character study “Mr. Six,” he was one bad dude back in the day. That was before the money-obsessed modern age in China gave rise to spoiled rich kids, fancy modified cars and a general lack of decency. All these problems bedevil Mr. Six, whose estranged son is held captive by a wealthy, speed-racing brat named Kris. 
 
‽
‽45 Years‽,‽Film is an art that plays tricks with time. A movie is a fixed, finite, relatively short experience — a hundred minutes or so in a given viewer’s life — that can span years, even centuries. The phrase “real time,” sometimes applied to movies that match their internal and external chronologies, expresses a wish and a delusion. In reality, as on screen, time compresses, expands, doubles back on itself and even, now and then, appears to stop. 
Mr. Haigh, who at 42 is a few years shy of his movie’s title, shades his picture of the Mercers with subtle nostalgia. Like the couple played by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen in Mike Leigh’s “Another Year,” Geoff and Kate are serene survivors of Britain’s postwar transformation, beneficiaries of the collapse of old hierarchies and the expansion of opportunity. Ms. Rampling, 69, and Mr. Courtenay, 78, are themselves both avatars of the ’60s, though her star rose a bit later than his. In “Billy Liar” and “The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner” he established himself as one of the era’s great rebels, a wiry, jumpy young man pushing upward and outward against the constraints of class and circumstance. 
It isn’t hard to supply adventurous pasts for Geoff and Kate, who reminisce fondly about the early days of their relationship. But the past intrudes on them in an unexpected and unnerving way. As they are arranging a big anniversary party, a letter arrives from Switzerland. The body of Katya, a former girlfriend of Geoff’s who died in a mountaineering accident while they were traveling together, has been recovered from a glacier, and the authorities believe Geoff is the next of kin. 
In his previous feature, the wondrous “Weekend,” Mr. Haigh showed how a brief sexual encounter between two young men could contain a lifetime’s worth of feeling. After 48 hours together, the lovers had somehow arrived at a complete and perfect knowledge of one another. “45 years” points its inquiry into the ways of love in the opposite direction, and suggests that even after decades together, two people can remain perfect strangers. 
‽
‽He Never Died‽,‽Performances don’t come more deadpan than the one Henry Rollins gives in “He Never Died,” an enjoyably strange horror film directed by Jason Krawczyk. Though perhaps “deadpan” is a poor choice of words, given that Mr. Rollins’s character, Jack, seems unable to die. 
“He Never Died” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for gore and strong language. 
‽
‽Noma My Perfect Storm‽,‽In the combat sport of haute cuisine, few recent careers have intrigued as much as that of René Redzepi, the head chef of Noma, in Copenhagen, which has topped a list of the world’s best restaurants four of the last six years. Mr. Redzepi co-founded Noma first on the principle of resurrecting Nordic cuisine, and then on the idea of “time and place” — intricately preparing dishes using only local and seasonally appropriate ingredients. 
‽
‽Son of Saul‽,‽The shape of the screen is unusually narrow in “Son of Saul,” the 38-year-old Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes’s debut feature. Nearly square, it evokes an earlier era, when all movies looked this way, and also emphasizes the claustrophobia of the story and the setting. We are in a Nazi death camp, and really in it, to a degree that few fictional films have had the nerve to attempt. The camera doesn’t just survey the barracks and the guard towers, the haggard prisoners and brutal guards. It takes us to the very door of the gas chambers, in the close company of Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig), a Jewish inmate who is a member of the camp’s Sonderkommando (special commando) unit. 
This larger history is kept outside the frame. Shot mostly in extended close-ups (the skilled director of photography is Matyas Erdely), “Son of Saul” moves rapidly and relentlessly in the present tense, never leaving Saul’s side. Not that we penetrate his thoughts. Mr. Rohrig, a poet and former teacher appearing in his first film, has the intriguing opacity that distinguishes nonprofessional actors. Like Lamberto Maggiorani in “Bicycle Thieves” or Maria Falconetti in “The Passion of Joan of Arc,” he is an indelibly particular, almost spiritually intense, screen presence. His face is hard to read and impossible to forget — a mask of stoicism, anguish, exhaustion and cunning. 
Our eyes are trained on Saul, and therefore we don’t see much of what he sees. Mr. Nemes uses shallow focus techniques that blur everything not immediately in front of his protagonist’s face. Though we find ourselves in close proximity to death, we are also detached from it. Human figures are blurred, movements are indistinct, and horrifying sounds — cries, gasps, footsteps, blows — reach us from invisible sources. 
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the mass murder of the Jews seemed to many artists and intellectuals to exist beyond the reach of representation. It was something to be handled with the utmost care and gravity. But art, especially popular art, abhors a vacuum, and the Shoah is, among other things, a rich reservoir of stories, true and speculative. There are works of narrative — like Claude Lanzmann’s “Shoah” or the novels of Patrick Modiano — that try to measure the gulf between past and present and to document the inadequacy of memory. There are others that try to bridge that gap by recreating or retrieving a sense of what actually happened. “Schindler’s List” remains the best-known — and one of the best examples. And there are some that try to fill the void with fable and fantasy, like “Inglourious Basterds” and “Life Is Beautiful.” 
‽
‽Bajirao Mastani‽,‽At the beginning of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s “Bajirao Mastani,” a Bollywood romance set in 18th-century India, there’s much talk of planting saffron (that is, Hindu) flags in Delhi, the heart of the Mughal (that is, Muslim) empire. Is this going to be an unpleasant India-for-Hindus epic? On the other hand, the movie seems to have some feminist bona fides: Mastani (Deepika Padukone) is an impressively fierce woman warrior, who saves the life of the equally fierce Bajirao (Ranveer Singh) on the battlefield as arrows whiz by her head. “Mastani writes her own destiny,” she says. Well, O.K. 
‽
‽Sisters‽,‽“Sisters” is a movie to go out and see when you’ve run out of television to watch. Which could happen, at least theoretically. Directed by Jason Moore (“Pitch Perfect”) from a script by the longtime “Saturday Night Live” writer Paula Pell, this raunchy-huggy comedy features, in keeping with Hollywood custom, a gaggle of well-known and well-liked sitcom and sketch-comedy performers being a little less funny than you want them to be. They are allowed to swear more robustly than on network or basic-cable shows, to deliver sentimental speeches along with punch lines and to play with or against type as the mood suits. 
Tina Fey, as Kate Ellis, falls — or rather leaps — into the “against” category. We’re used to seeing Ms. Fey (especially but not only on “30 Rock”) as an anxious overthinker using her caustic sarcasm as a weapon against both her own insecurities and the flakes and train wrecks who surround her. This time, she gets to be the train wreck. Kate is sometimes scolded for her irresponsibility by her teenage daughter, Haley (Madison Davenport), but her real foil is her younger sister, Maura, played in full goody-two-shoes splendor by Amy Poehler. Way back in 2008, in “Baby Mama,” Ms. Poehler was the wayward yin to Ms. Fey’s uptight yang. This time, the polarities are reversed, but the performers are too restless, and too much in sync, to settle into a simple pattern. 
When they were growing up — as attested to in passages from diaries they find in their old bedroom — Kate was hedonistic and adventurous, while Maura was prudent and prudish. In their 40s, they find themselves stuck in these roles. Kate is a hothead who can’t hold down a job. Maura, a nurse, is divorced and lonely. 
To add to their woes, Kate and Maura’s parents (James Brolin and Dianne Wiest) have decided to sell the family home in Orlando, Fla., and move into a condominium complex where they have less space and more sex. Their easygoing retirement bliss is a rebuke to their daughters’ midlife misery. Kate and Maura don’t seem to know how to be happy, except when they are together in the childhood home they are about to lose. 
The party movie is a venerable genre. So is the movie-as-party, which is a slightly different creature. “Sisters” is a hybrid of the two, and also, therefore, a fairly standard specimen of modern post-“Hangover” commercial film comedy. It falls into the same category as “Neighbors” or “The Night Before,” which is to say it’s uneven, generally enjoyable, self-consciously naughty and also, despite drug use and jokes about anal sex, more concerned with reassurance than transgression. 
Since Maura has a crush on a hunky neighbor (Ike Barinholtz, playing a handsome dullard rather than the goofball you might know from “The Mindy Project”), she is allowed to cut loose and go crazy. Kate reluctantly agrees to be the sober “party mom.” At first the guests glumly act their age, but then the tequila starts to flow, the music becomes loud, the joints are lit and the requisite funny stuff starts to happen. The respectable wife and mother (Samantha Bee) takes her top off. The jokey fat guy (Bobby Moynihan) loses his pants. The sad, weird woman (Rachel Dratch) gets drunker and weirder and sadder. The mean girl (Maya Rudolph) tries to crash the party, and then to sabotage it. The audience learns which groups Hollywood is still willing to treat as comic stereotypes, with the usual escape clause that the stereotypes themselves are being held up for mockery. It turns out to be Asian women and lesbians. 
But nobody really gets hurt (except for maybe Mr. Barinholtz’s character, who has an uncomfortable encounter with a ballerina music box), and nobody stays mad. Unlike small-screen sitcom characters, who can change slowly over seasons or not at all, the protagonists of movie comedies must grow, learn, change and forgive. This is almost always a drag, even when it’s kind of touching, as it is here.

‽Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip‽,‽Now would be an excellent time for parents of young children to invest in earplugs. A new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie has landed. This one’s called “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,” the fourth in the series, which began in 2007 and mixes live-action and computer-generated characters. 
“Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for rude humor and language. 
‽
‽Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back‽,‽“I think he’s one of the greatest artists that we have today — but he could also be the worst,” a collector says in “Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back.” It’s one of several bits of hyperbole in a documentary that works best when it stops overanalyzing its subject and instead focuses on his mischievous art. 
Still, the art is the star and Ms. Axelrod features plenty of it. She also outlines a knowing path through Mr. Cattelan’s career, leaving just enough room to have you wondering if the artist is more of a con man than a genius. On that, make your own decision. No expert is needed. 
‽
‽In Search of Israeli Cuisine‽,‽“In Search of Israeli Cuisine” starts out seeming as if it might be indistinguishable from any of the countless globe-hopping foodie shows on television. As it goes along, though, this documentary by Roger Sherman at least touches on issues like culinary appropriation and national identity as defined through food. When it’s not being overly promotional, it can be interesting. 
It’s too bad the film doesn’t have more of this feisty interplay — long stretches are just the usual food-speak about local ingredients and childhoods spent watching Grandma cook. Its best segments, though, are an informative take on a subject that is still very much evolving. 
‽
‽Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America‽,‽The African-American musician Daryl Davis, a journeyman who has played backup for Chuck Berry, has an unusual hobby. He cultivates cordial relationships with prominent racists — Ku Klux Klan leaders, front men for neo-Nazi groups and so on — and through a form of friendly persuasion, tries to steer them from their bigotry. 
This movie arrives two weeks after Carl Paladino, a white political operative and ally of President-elect Donald J. Trump, equated the first lady, Michelle Obama, to a gorilla, then said in a follow-up interview that his remarks were “not racist.” 
‽
‽Paterson‽,‽Poems slip across the screen like water in “Paterson,” Jim Jarmusch’s wonderful new dispatch from Jarmusch-land. Sometimes they appear over water, too, surfacing word by word on images of the Great Falls along the Passaic River in Paterson, N.J. No pen or pencil directly spells out these words, no clattering keyboard or banging typewriter. Instead, the words — in a neat, cramped hand — appear onscreen as they are read aloud by their author, Paterson (Adam Driver), a soulful bus driver and basement poet. It’s as if he were beaming his heart-song straight from his head into yours. 
It’s a quiet life, its rhythms determined by labor and the old Monday through Friday routine. Like most people’s workweeks, his story opens on a Monday, that word stamped on the screen. Dividing stories into units of time, into hours and days, is a familiar structuring device, sometimes used for suspense or to create a countdown. Stanley Kubrick inserted days on title cards in “The Shining,” jumping from “Tuesday” to “Thursday,” a gap that suggests that something is amiss with time itself and that amps the unease. In “Paterson,” by contrast, the march of days announces both the regimentation of Paterson’s punch-clock obligations and the story’s structure, its pattern. 
Patterns — including yards of circles, dancing squiggles and twinned images — fill “Paterson,” creating a vibrant visual punctuation to the otherwise relaxed storytelling. Mr. Jarmusch likes to take it nice and easy, and this movie is fairly low-key, even by his fairly chill standards. Paterson’s work demands consistency, routine, punctuation and safety (no speedy action-flick escapades here), which create a kind of meditative flow. Passengers come and go, embarking and disembarking and talking or kidding about this and that. Paterson cocks an ear to listen to this human babble, bobbing in and out of its stream before heading over to the city’s magnificent Great Falls to eat lunch. 
Williams lived and practiced medicine near Paterson, and borrowed its name for his multipart epic poem, which, he wrote, involves “the resemblance between the mind of modern man and a city.” He opens the first of its volumes by declaring, “Rigor of beauty is the quest,” only to ask, “But how will you find beauty when it is locked in the mind past all remonstrance?” 
Williams suggests that the answer is “to make a start, out of particulars and make them general,” adding that all we know is our “own complexities.” As Paterson writes, Mr. Jarmusch sometimes fills the screen with particulars — Laura’s face, the crashing falls — superimposing them as if to suggest ideas swirling into words, patterns and poetry. 
‽
‽Toni Erdmann‽,‽Early in “Toni Erdmann” — by a wide margin the funniest almost-three-hour German comedy you will ever see — there is a brief discussion, conducted in a sterile modern office building in Bucharest, about the meaning of the English word “performance.” For Anca (Ingrid Bisu), a young Romanian employed by a global consulting firm, it refers to the way she does her job and, more than that, her ability to obey the norms and protocols of the corporate workplace. Her boss, she explains, gives her “a lot of feedback,” which is clearly a euphemism. 
It is, most simply but also most elusively, a sweet and thorny tale of father-daughter bonding with a finely honed edge of generational conflict, propelled by two extraordinarily natural, utterly fearless performances. Winfried, a shaggy baby boomer, has had the luxury of conflating irresponsibility with idealism. Amicably divorced from Ines’s mother, devoted to his own mother and his aging dog, he has settled into a permanent, pleasant state of not-quite-adulthood, in which he reserves the right not to take anything too seriously.

‽Dangal‽,‽Let it never be said that if you’ve seen one inspirational sports movie, you’ve seen them all. 
Based on the true story of Geeta and Babita Phogat (played as children by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar and as adults by Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra), who eventually competed in the Olympics, and their trainer-father, Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan), the movie benefits from the amount of time it devotes to wrestling strategy. It pays off in suspenseful bouts that haven’t been hyperedited into incoherence, with actresses who really appear to be grappling. 
‽
‽Why Him?‽,‽From the moment we spy the dead-moose art installation that graces the home of Laird (James Franco) in “Why Him?,” we suspect that the glass tank of urine in which it floats will at some point crack and douse one or more characters. It’s no fun at all being right. 
The standoff between the two men, then, is a rich vein that the filmmakers mine for no more than cheap, excruciatingly belabored gags. None more so than a homage to the “Pink Panther” movies, a sequence that the filmmakers smother so thoroughly in explanation that even the marvelous Keegan-Michael Key is unable to bring about resuscitation. 
‽
‽Julieta‽,‽According to a poem by Elizabeth Bishop, “the art of losing isn’t hard to master.” But making a masterwork on the subject of loss, a perennial theme in art, may be harder than it looks. The young adulthood and middle age of Julieta, the heroine of Pedro Almodóvar’s new movie, are shadowed by death and abandonment, which she does her best to handle gracefully. Mr. Almodóvar, for his part, tells her story with his characteristic later-period blend of elegant restraint and keening melodrama. “Julieta” is scrupulous, compassionate and surprising, even if it does not always quite communicate the full gravity and sweep of the feelings it engages. 
The colors are important because they are part of Mr. Almodóvar’s emotional vocabulary. In his films, clothes, wallpaper and furniture are never mere details of production design; they are integral to the world he imagines, a rendering of contemporary Spain filtered through selected works of literature and Hollywood films of the 1950s and accompanied, more often than not, by the lustrous ache of Alberto Iglesias’s music. 
Here, as before, the cinematic reference point is Douglas Sirk, whose finely wrought, visually lush weepies have long figured among Mr. Almodóvar’s key inspirations. Julieta’s experiences — love, marriage, motherhood, small-town life — are drawn from a trilogy of linked short stories by the Canadian writer (and Nobel laureate) Alice Munro. At first, this may seem an odd match of author and filmmaker. Ms. Munro’s northern world is a place of drab, wintry tones and buttoned-up emotions, a far cry from Mr. Almodóvar’s empire of passions. 
“Julieta” has all of that, and arranges its plot not only in a straight chronological line but also according to a pattern that is at once loose and intricate. Young Julieta, a student of classics on her way to a teaching job, falls for a fisherman named Xoan (Daniel Grao) and goes to live with him in a small coastal town. They raise a daughter, Antia, amid ocean breezes and under the watchful eye of a busybody (the Almodóvar fixture Rossy de Palma). Julieta befriends Ava (Inma Cuesta), a former lover of Xoan’s, and Ava’s sculptures become part of the film’s cabinet of talismans and symbols. 
Ms. Suárez suffers with a dignity reminiscent of Bette Davis and other great screen heroines of the past, even as she surrenders to a longing that borders on mania. In a letter to her absent daughter, she likens maternal love to an addiction, and the second half of her story follows the familiar, agonizing stages of recovery, relapse and at least partial or potential redemption. 
‽
‽Passengers‽,‽There is a blazing light at the center of the interplanetary romance “Passengers,” and its name is Jennifer Lawrence. In a love story whose attempt to be an interstellar “Titanic” eventually falls flat, Ms. Lawrence’s character, Aurora, is an ambitious journalist aboard the Avalon, a commercial spacecraft making a historic 120-year voyage. Its destination is Homestead II, a pioneer colony of an overcrowded Earth. The spunky, whip-smart Aurora, who bought a round-trip ticket, hopes to write the first book about Homestead II upon her return to New York. 
At its most gripping, “Passengers,” directed by Morten Tyldum (“The Imitation Game”) from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts (a collaborator on the scripts for “The Darkest Hour,” “Prometheus” and “Doctor Strange”), conveys the panic and despair of finding yourself trapped in a luxurious corporate prison in the middle of nowhere. Solitary confinement, even amid opulence, is solitary torture. 
Their idyll abruptly ends when Arthur spills the beans to Aurora about Jim’s role in her awakening, and she explodes in a stunning fit of fury that is the movie’s dramatic high point. 
Before its midpoint, the film begins its retreat from the moral questions raised by Jim’s selfishly dragging Aurora into his personal hell. He may be handsome and charming and mechanically adept, but he’s rather dull and inarticulate with no defined personality. 
‽
‽Sing‽,‽The things you can do with computer animation these days are just more and more amazing. In “Sing,” a funny animal jukebox musical cartoon written and directed by Garth Jennings (“Son of Rambow”), there is a scene in which two postpunk porcupines, one of whom has been selected to compete in a vocal competition, argue at home about the state of their relationship, and their musical direction. During their quarrel I thought, with absolute earnestness, “Wow, these porcupines have an unusually spacious apartment.” 
A failing theatrical entrepreneur, Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey), a koala of some winsomeness and no small enthusiasm, decides to revive his fortunes with a singing competition. From a slew of auditioners (his secretary, an iguana with one glass eye, has advertised the award money as $100,000 rather than the single grand he actually has) he picks a motley handful. Among them: Johnny (Taron Egerton), a gorilla from a British-accented bank-robbing clan, who sings like Sam Smith when he’s not singing like Elton John; Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), a stressed housewife pig; a crooning, fedora-sporting, smart-mouthed mouse named Mike (Seth MacFarlane, duh); and a shy elephant, Meena (Tori Kelly), who sings Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” to herself when nobody’s listening. 
“Sing” is relentlessly amiable, and has little in the way of vulgar humor. There’s just one flatulence joke, which has to be some kind of record for a contemporary non-Pixar kid-friendly animated movie. (The film is produced by Illumination, the corporation behind “Despicable Me” and its spinoff, “Minions.”) 
‽
‽Fences‽,‽By the end of “Fences,” we will have learned a lot about Troy Maxson — about his hard Southern childhood, his time in prison and the Negro Leagues, his work ethic, his sexual appetites and his parenting philosophy — but the first and most important thing we know about the man is that he is one of the world’s great talkers. He enters the screen on a tide of verbiage, jawing with his friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and bantering with his wife, Rose (Viola Davis). The audience quickly grasps what Rose and Bono have known for years. Troy is by turns funny, provocative, inspiring and hurtful, but one thing he will never be as long as he draws breath is silent. 
Language is also, in another sense, Troy’s very substance. He came into being as words on the page, words assembled and given life by the playwright August Wilson. Embodied onstage first by James Earl Jones in the original 1985 production of “Fences” and more recently by Denzel Washington in the 2010 Broadway revival, Troy is one of the indelible characters in American dramatic literature, equal to — and in some ways a pointed response to — Arthur Miller’s Willy Loman. 
Mr. Washington, reprising the role in this fine film adaptation, which he also directed, is a pretty good talker in his own right. His voice is a mighty instrument, and if you closed your eyes and just listened to “Fences” you would hear a verbal performance of unmatched force and nuance. More than one, in fact. Ms. Davis, who also starred in that 2010 revival, has fewer lines, but as the story of their marriage unfolds, the center of gravity shifts quietly and inexorably in her direction. Rose’s plain-spokenness is the necessary counterweight to her husband’s grandiloquence. 
But even as it properly foregrounds Wilson’s dialogue — few playwrights have approached his genius for turning workaday vernacular into poetry — “Fences” is much more than a filmed reading. Mr. Washington has wisely resisted the temptation to force a lot of unnecessary cinema on the play. The action ventures beyond Troy and Rose’s yard — into their house and onto the street, mostly — to give them a bit more room to move and the audience a little more to look at. Confinement, however, is a theme implied in the play’s title, and opening it up too much would risk diluting the power of watching large personalities colliding in a narrow place. 
It’s 1957, though, and time has betrayed him. When in 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color line, it was too late for Troy, and his bitterness infects his relationship with Cory, who is being scouted for college football scholarships. Troy’s other son, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), is a musician, and the dynamic among the three of them is one of the ways “Fences” echoes “Death of a Salesman.” Troy’s betrayal of Rose is another. 
To say that the difference between Willy and Troy is racial is to state the obvious and also to risk understating Wilson’s achievement. “Fences” is part of a cycle of 10 plays about the African-American experience that amounts to a critique of the American dream from the standpoint of people intent on defying their exclusion from it. If Willy Loman’s tragedy proceeds from disillusionment, Troy’s redemption is possible because he never had any illusions to begin with. His rigid ideas about work, responsibility and manhood constitute not a demand for attention, but an assertion of dignity. His cruelty, selfishness and shortsightedness are somehow inseparable from his loyalty, his steadfastness and his existential courage. 
‽
‽Neruda‽,‽“Neruda,” Pablo Larraín’s semifantastical biopic, is a warmhearted film about a hot-blooded man that is nonetheless troubled by a subtle, perceptible chill. Blending fact with invention, it tells the story of a confrontation between an artist (the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda) and an emerging dictatorship, and more generally illuminates the endless struggle between political authority and the creative imagination. For anyone who believes that poetry and democracy spring from the same source and provoke the same enemies, this movie provides both encouragement and warning. 
Neruda also composes “Canto General,” his great, Whitmanesque work on the glories and miseries of Latin America. Pages are distributed clandestinely, and committed to memory by workers and peasants. Their popularity, and Neruda’s easygoing populism, are a rebuke to the arrogance of the ruling class and the Chilean state. And Mr. Larraín’s eye for the rugged beauty of Chile’s protean landscapes implies a similar argument. The poet is open to nature and humanity. The policeman is consumed by rules, tactics and procedures. 
Peluchonneau is a tragically constricted soul, but not an entirely unsympathetic character. Neruda is a heroic figure — comic and Dionysian, brilliant and naughty — but his personal Javert is in some ways the film’s protagonist. Neruda is annoyed and sometimes amused by the detective’s doggedness, but Peluchonneau is haunted by the poet’s mystique, and by a growing sense of his own incompleteness. A curious symbiosis develops between them, a dynamic more complex and strange than the simple conflict of good and evil. 
‽
‽Collateral Beauty‽,‽The five stages of grief sometimes seem applicable to movie reviewing, except that I usually skip denial, rarely get around to acceptance and generally just settle into anger, which is where I am with “Collateral Beauty.” Many of the words that I would like to use to describe this waste of talent and time, which riffs on Dickens’s eternal “A Christmas Carol” and tries to manufacture feeling by offing Tiny Tim, can’t be lobbed in a family publication. So, instead, I will just start by throwing out some permissible insults: artificial, clichéd, mawkish, preposterous, incompetent, sexist, laughable, insulting. 
The story involves Howard’s three associates and ostensible friends (Edward Norton, Michael Peña, Kate Winslet) trying to wrest control of the company from him. In his grief, he has written letters to love, time and death, all of which he has a beef with, which suggests he needs real help. Instead, the associates hire actors (Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore, Helen Mirren) to personify these abstractions, the idea being that they will engage Howard while he’s being secretly taped. The associates will then doctor the results to make it look as if he’s talking to himself. It’s a cruel, mercenary strategy, but the movie is selling uplift, not a lesson in 21st-century rapacious capitalism, so their duplicity is delivered with sniffles, smiles and hollow rationalizations. 
‽
‽Short Stay‽,‽Of the many words that might describe Mike (Mike Maccherone), the protagonist of Ted Fendt’s dour, poker-faced comedy, “Short Stay,” “deadbeat” and “slacker” are two that immediately come to mind. 
As it drags along, the movie makes you feel trapped in the shoes of someone destined for failure. The closest thing to a conflict arises when Mark returns from Poland and asks Mike to move out and give him back his job, and Mike resists. He crashes in the apartments of acquaintances and in the saddest image sleeps on a kitchen floor. It is no way to live. 
‽
‽Two Lovers and a Bear‽,‽“Two Lovers and a Bear” begins with two-thirds of the title characters — the lovers — sledding to a frozen body of water, where they then drill holes and do some ice fishing. Passing time while waiting for a bite, the male lover talks about the fact that there are only two musicians that he likes. 
This does not happen. And, eventually, I did come to accept the characters, Roman (Dane DeHaan) and Lucy (Tatiana Maslany), who live in a Canadian town near the North Pole that functions, in their case, as an escape for damaged young souls. 
‽
‽The Wasted Times‽,‽Set against the backdrop of the second Sino-Japanese War, “The Wasted Times” has the outward appearance of being a sweeping gangland epic. But by employing a nonlinear structure, Cheng Er — who wrote, directed and edited this film — severely diffuses the story’s dramatic impact. To think back through the narrative, which spans more than a decade, is to wonder what was gained by withholding details only to reveal them later in flashbacks. 
‽
‽Rogue One: A Star Wars Story‽,‽The great mystery of “Rogue One” — the big payoff, the thing people like me would be pilloried for divulging, the puzzle you will congratulate yourself for solving — is where it fits in with the rest of the “Star Wars” cycle. There are scattered hints early on, and later appearances by familiar characters that elicit chuckles of recognition from fans. The very last shot tells us exactly where we are, and why we should have cared about everything we just saw. 
But the injunction not to ruin anyone’s good time by “revealing spoilers and detailed story points” is itself revealing, an indication of the meager and disposable pleasures this movie is meant to provide, and also of the low regard its makers have for the audience. It hasn’t always been this way, of course. The first “Star Wars” trilogy had a fresh, insurgent energy, and learning the names of all those planets and galactic adventurers has seemed, to generations of fans, like a new and special kind of fun. 
Now, though, it is starting to feel like drudgery, a schoolbook exercise in a course of study that has no useful application and that will never end. “Rogue One,” named for the call sign of an imperial cargo ship appropriated by rebel fighters, is the opposite of that vessel. Masquerading as a heroic tale of rebellion, its true spirit is Empire all the way down. Like the fighters on the planet Scarif, which is surrounded by an all-but-impenetrable atmospheric shield, you are trapped inside this world, subjected to its whims and laws. You can’t escape, because it is the supposed desire to escape that brought you here in the first place. 
Maybe I’m exaggerating. The cast is wonderful. Felicity Jones is a fine addition to the “Star Wars” tradition of tough-minded, quick-thinking heroines. She plays Jyn Erso, the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a scientist whose allegiances are a little ambiguous. Not at all ambiguous is Ben Mendelsohn’s Orson Krennic, a marvel of sneering, vainglorious villainy in an impeccable white uniform, complete with a cape that billows behind him when he strides down a starship catwalk. 
All the pieces are there, in other words, like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven’t really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them. A couple of 9-year-olds on a screen-free rainy afternoon would come up with better adventures, and probably also better dialogue. Plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger Lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. 
You’re left wanting both more and less. There are too many characters, too much tactical and technical explanation, too much pseudo-political prattle. And at the same time, there isn’t quite enough of the filial dynamic between Galen and Jyn, and not enough weight given to the ethical and strategic problems of rebellion. When might ends justify means? What kind of sacrifice is required in the service of a righteous cause? 
‽
‽After Auschwitz‽,‽The anguish that underlies “After Auschwitz” is profound. Yet hope still flickers throughout this documentary, which tells the stories of six Jewish women who survived the Nazi death machine and went on to rebuild their lives in the United States. 
Jon Kean, the director, chose the material wisely and doesn’t shy from severe images. He and his team also have good ears for anecdotes. One woman remembers making clothes from old parachutes. Another tells of pulling her son out of the Boy Scouts; the organization’s uniforms and practices reminded her too much of the Germans. 
‽
‽Breaking Point: The War for Democracy in Ukraine‽,‽The first line of the Ukrainian national anthem is “Ukraine has not yet died,” one interviewee says in “Breaking Point,” a fierce documentary about that country and its recent clashes with Russia. For a land often perched on the edge of ruin, she says, mere survival is something to celebrate. 
Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has been subject to constant pressure from Russia, whose forces seized Crimea in 2014 then intervened to support armed separatists in Eastern Ukraine. 
The filmmakers supply terrifying footage: At civilian rallies, we see nightstick beatings and bloody riots. During military battles, bullets whiz by and explosions shake the cameras. Nerve-racking scenes follow Ukraine’s extraordinarily bold volunteer soldiers. 
‽
‽The Last Family‽,‽The Polish painter Zdzislaw Beksinski is not well known here, but an appreciation of this often funny but also harrowing and heartbreaking film does not require expertise on its subject. I should actually say “subjects.” As per the title, this fictionalized portrait is a family one. The movie opens in 2005, the year of Beksinski’s death, with him making some wry and libidinous comments about future technology to a man we’ll learn was his biographer. It then jumps back to 1977, and Beksinski (Andrzej Seweryn, unimpeachable, as is the rest of the cast) and his wife and mother walk across a plaza from their own apartment block to an unfinished one, where Beksinski’s adult son, Tomasz, will live. At this point Tomasz is already struggling with mental illness. 
‽
‽In the Fade‽,‽“In the Fade,” the new film by Fatih Akin, is divided into three parts. The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to “Law &amp; Order” fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg. 
If the first section of “In the Fade” provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life — the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism — the second part zeros in on the gears of the country’s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja’s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous. 
But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience’s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back? 
‽
‽All the Money in the World‽,‽“The quality of mercy is not strained,” Portia tells Shylock in “The Merchant of Venice.” It is “twice blest; it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.” The billionaire J. Paul Getty would probably have disagreed with Shakespeare’s take. A hoarder of women, art, antiquities — and most of all, money — Getty also might have taken issue with Portia’s claim that mercy “becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.” Portia delivers her mercy speech as she tries to persuade Shylock not to take a pound of flesh. She would have had an even tougher time with Getty. 
Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn’t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn’t matter. 
Mr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya’s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he’s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It’s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation. 
‽
‽Phantom Thread‽,‽Reynolds Woodcock, a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s, has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (“Never cursed” is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a princess.) These invisible traces of his hand — hidden meanings in the literal sense — signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art, obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator. 
The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It’s just a movie. It’s just a dress. When Reynolds’s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more “chic,” the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions. 
That discrepancy — between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism — may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since “There Will Be Blood,” Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they’re about or who they might be for. 
The difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true. 
‽
‽Happy End‽,‽If you are even only a little familiar with the work of the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, it will come as no surprise that he does not regard instant messaging and smartphones as positive developments for humanity. His latest picture, “Happy End,” begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone, its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman’s routine. 
Like many of Mr. Haneke’s films from the past two decades, “Happy End” is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne’s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in “My Night at Maud’s,” released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in “A Man and a Woman,” 1966) or a fascist dupe (in “The Conformist,” 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie’s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit. 
‽
‽Father Figures‽,‽Moviegoers may recall the basic premise of “Father Figures” from “Flirting With Disaster,” a vastly funnier 1996 comedy by David O. Russell. “Father Figures” doesn’t merely flirt. It stars Ed Helms as Peter and Owen Wilson as Kyle, two of the least-related-seeming twins in history. On the day their mother (Glenn Close) marries some cool cat played by Harry Shearer, they learn that their father isn’t dead, as they thought, but just unknown. Mom didn’t practice monogamy in the disco era. 
‽
‽Bright‽,‽With the buddy-cop fantasy “Bright,” Will Smith and the director David Ayer attempt to chart new territory: an urban action film populated not only by humans but also fantastical creatures like centaurs, fairies, orcs and elves. (If you’re unfamiliar with orcs, check your J. R. R. Tolkien.) The result is a loud, ungainly hybrid that does not serve police procedurals or fantasy spectaculars very well. 
‽
‽Downsizing‽,‽One of my favorite movies of 2017, “War for the Planet of the Apes,” posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine. 
But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn’t that you consume less; it’s that you can have a whole lot more. That’s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong? 
Mr. Payne, who wrote “Downsizing” with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract — in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of “the small” — who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite — is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven’t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers. 
About an hour in, “Downsizing” amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we’ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul’s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau’s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity. 
‽
‽A German Life‽,‽“A German Life” is likely to be the last new movie of its kind: a documentary that presents contemporary testimony from someone who witnessed the inner workings of the Nazi high command. The movie is taken from 30 hours of interviews with Brunhilde Pomsel, who served as a secretary to Joseph Goebbels and was 103 when the film was shot. (She died in January at 106.) 
‽
‽Crooked House‽,‽The premise of the murder mystery “Crooked House” is old school: A much-loathed patriarch is sent to his grave, and a houseful of resentful, back-stabbing kinfolk are under suspicion. This intermittently diverting movie is adapted from a 1949 Agatha Christie novel, and it’s several degrees more engaging than another recent Christie-based movie, “Murder on the Orient Express.” But it’s still slight. 
‽
‽Hangman‽,‽The most and least that can be said for “Hangman” is that it doesn’t approach the mesmerizing ineptitude of “88 Minutes,” another movie that pitted Al Pacino against a serial killer from about a decade ago. This time, the killer carves letters into the victims’ bodies, spelling out a message in a tribute to the children’s word game Hangman. The slick, music video-style opening credits — a staple of this genre since “Seven” — include an ominous box of crayons. 
‽
‽Pitch Perfect 3‽,‽When fans of the wry “Pitch Perfect” series first met the ragtag singing group the Barden Bellas, they were ensconced in the college a cappella bubble. “Pitch Perfect 3” finally bursts that bubble, following the Bellas into adult life. We are reintroduced to the group’s reluctant leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick), as she quits a demeaning record label job. In the same vein, Chloe (Brittany Snow) endures veterinary school, while Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) coasts on her Fat Amy Winehouse impersonation. Discouraged by the demands of the real world, the larger-than-life Bellas reunite to join a U.S.O. tour, where they vie to perform as the opening act for the record producer DJ Khaled (appearing as himself). 
‽
‽The Greatest Showman‽,‽Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.” 
Not much time is wasted on Barnum’s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories. 
‽
‽Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle‽,‽Very few remakes, sequels or franchise reboots have signaled their desperation to connect quite as nakedly as “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” does. The movie opens in 1996 with a young man finding the now-discarded board game that wreaked such havoc on its players in the 1995 Robin Williams movie. The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen’s console, something strange happens. 
The movie derives its humor, such as it is, from the teens’ avatar choices. The nerd gets to be Dwayne Johnson. The big football player gets to be Kevin Hart (who, it is frequently noted, is not tall). The shy, awkward Martha gets to be an expert in dance-fighting (played by Karen Gillan). And the selfie-obsessed girl gets to be, surprise, Jack Black. The crew must navigate a mission that involves a large gem and a villain (Bobby Cannavale) who has insects crawling in and out of his mouth more regularly than is considered normal.

‽Permanent‽,‽Eager to guarantee her social fitness at a new school before the term begins, the teenage Auralie (Kira McLean) badgers her parents, Jean and Jim (Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson), into allowing her to get a permanent. Arguing poverty, Auralie’s mother and father take her to a beauty-training salon for the procedure, and her-once slack locks, left in tight curlers too long, are majorly poofed. Her hair looks like Bob Dylan’s on the cover of his landmark album “Blonde on Blonde.” That was great for Dylan in 1966 New York, but not so much for an adolescent girl “somewhere in Virginia,” according to a title card, in 1982.

‽The Rape of Recy Taylor‽,‽Planting a flag firmly at the intersection of patriarchy, sexism and white supremacy, “The Rape of Recy Taylor” is a documentary of multiple layers and marvelous gumption. As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.

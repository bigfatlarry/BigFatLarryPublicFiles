‽Prisoners of the Sun‽,‽Bryan Brown is shaping up as the Australian Gene Hackman, an actor with a never-ending stream of films, most of them well beneath his talents. Mr. Brown's "FX2" and "Sweet Talker" came and went in May. His latest, "Prisoners of the Sun," opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse. It is a sincere, competent courtroom drama that never matches the demands of its historical subject. 
For a few early, harrowing moments, this fictional version of real events is as disturbing as it ought to be. In historical fact, in 1942 the Japanese held 1,100 Australian soldiers in a prisoner-of-war camp on the Indonesian island of Ambon. When the camp was liberated in 1945, only 300 had survived and the Japanese were tried as war criminals. 
"Prisoners of the Sun" begins after the war, when a group of Australian soldiers, led by Mr. Brown as the fictional Capt. Robert Cooper, forces the conquered Japanese to start digging on the island. Before long, rows of dirt-covered skulls and severed bones are lined up on the ground as the Japanese uncover a mass grave where hundreds of executed Australian soldiers were buried. 
What action there is belongs to Cooper, whose job is to prosecute the war criminals. An intelligent but predictably volatile hero, he goes head-to-head and sometimes hand-to-throat with the defendants. He begins with an aristocratic, taciturn vice admiral (played by George Takei, Mr. Sulu from "Star Trek"), who tries to pin the blame on his second-in-command, a man prone to bulldoggish growls of loyalty. 
The most sympathetic defendant is a lowly boyish-looking signals officer named Tanaka, who believed in his duty and his officers and who actually turned himself in for trial. Though this Australian film goes out of its way to avoid Japan-bashing, its Western bias is uneasily revealed through Tanaka, the only "good" Japanese in it and conspicuously the only Christian one as well. 
Cooper, of course, assumes that the vice admiral should be convicted for ordering the executions, but his higher-ups view the Japanese officer as a valuable pawn in reconstructing the postwar world. This bit of realpolitik appalls and astonishes Captain Cooper, who owes more than he should to Gary Cooper. 
The action may take place in a thatched-roof courthouse on an Indonesian island, but the dialogue rings of familiar Hollywood melodrama. When Cooper passionately responds to the sight of Australian bodies at the grave, his commanding officer says: "The war's over. We're lawyers, not soldiers"; Cooper grunts, "Yeah," in sarcastic response. When an American Army officer advises him to let the vice admiral go, Cooper snaps back, "That's not justice: it's politics." It's also not the stuff of absorbing movie scripts, however sincerely felt. 
"Prisoners of the Sun" regains its urgent, horrifying tone only when a dying Australian soldier testifies about his own brother's torture and murder. His flashbacks take the film out of the stuffy, unreal courtroom, giving it a final jolt of reality.

‽Eating‽,‽Of the 38 women who gather for a birthday party in Henry Jaglom's "Eating," almost none of them will touch the cake. And the few willing to do so hide out in solitary places, like the bathroom, so as to commune with dessert in perfect privacy. Food assumes near-religious importance in Mr. Jaglom's portrait of needy, anxious women who spend an entire day playing upon one another's insecurities, and waxing rhapsodic about well-remembered culinary thrills. That perfect bodies are irreconcilable with cream puffs becomes a source of genuine and amusingly well-expressed regret. 
Mr. Jaglom's attitude toward his film's dizzying array of narcissists is extremely fond, which is a lot of what gives "Eating" its warmth and humor. Seen through a colder eye, the film's characters would quickly become insufferable. The subjects under discussion -- the suggestion that someone might need a lower-lids eyelift, or the cry of "I hate my cheeks!" from someone else -- are so relentlessly trivial that after a while they begin to take on a life of their own. Mr. Jaglom makes no higher claims for his characters' importance, but he does claim to understand what makes them miserable, and perhaps that's enough. 
The film's style is colorfully cluttered in the manner of Robert Altman (Mr. Altman's "Wedding," another party epic, comes to mind), but Mr. Jaglom seldom shapes his material quite that well. Few of the roles here are really written, or even as fully conceived as they might have been; much of the film sounds improvised and is allowed to drift. The story's ostensible focus is the 40th birthday of Helene (Lisa Richards), who faces her anxieties by curling up with a muffin and proclaiming that on her birthday she is free to eat anything she wants. A couple of other birthdays provide subsidiary interest, and an excuse to bring on several more birthday cakes. 
As the house fills up with talkative guests and peculiar presents (Helene is given at least two things that qualify as "tools for getting out your suppressed anger"), the overheard and overlapping small talk turns to weight, men, cosmetic issues and career opportunities. A talent agent named Sadie (Marlena Giovi), celebrating her 50th birthday, talks about her younger boyfriend and nags her overweight daughter Jennifer (Daphna Kastner), while elsewhere one of Sadie's clients asks advice on how to abandon Sadie in favor of someone more powerful. "You write her a letter, you give her a present, and then you go with Sam Cohn," another actress advises this would-be deserter. "And you take me with you." 
Meanwhile, Helene's supposed best friend Sophie (Gwen Welles), the film's most fully formed character and its most unremittingly nasty one, foments trouble at every possible opportunity. She concentrates particular attention on the slim, pretty Kate (Mary Crosby), who is sufficiently happy in her marriage to make the other guests wild with disbelief. Among the other principals are a French film maker (Nelly Alard) who inspires waves of resentment and admiration by looking too good in a bathing suit, and Helene's mother, who expresses shock at the silliness of much of what surrounds her. As played by the elegant Frances Bergen, this woman enchantingly recalls an age in which good sense and good form counted for at least as much as a good body. When asked to recall a favorite food, she thinks of caviar. 
Some of the best lines in this leisurely, uneven film -- which opens today at the Cinema Village 12th Street -- are throwaway observations about food and all it stands for. "The last time I had sugar I ate it for five days straight," someone confesses. There are rapturous descriptions of pumpernickel bread and Canadian bacon. Composers are equated with meals (Vivaldi is thought to be like fruit salad). "I'm not really involved with food anymore -- I've found a lot of distractions," says one woman in an extremely peculiar hat. "Like what?" she is asked. "Clothes, men, accessories," she answers. 
"I think I'm still looking for a man who could excite me as much as a baked potato," someone else observes, summing up the film's connections between sex, love, longing and self-imposed starvation. That indeed is food for thought. 
"Eating" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) It includes profanity and brief nudity.

‽The Killer‽,‽Balletic splatter and camp sentimentality have rarely if ever been stretched to the extremes found in John Woo's movie "The Killer." Written and directed by Hong Kong's answer to Sam Peckinpah, the action thriller arrives today at the Village East Cinemas, having already acquired a cult reputation from its showings at the Toronto and Sundance film festivals. 
Alternately gripping and laughable, the movie's mixture of blood and suds suggests an unlikely fusion of "The Wild Bunch" and "Dark Victory," with other movie references thrown into the mix. The most outrageous allusion, to "Duel in the Sun," comes in the final sequence, in which blinded lovers grope toward each other through the blood-soaked dirt for a final clinch and fail to connect. 
Set in contemporary Hong Kong, "The Killer" tells the story of Jeff Chow, a hired gun with a heart of gold who falls in love with a nightclub singer named Jennie, whom he has accidentally blinded during a shoot out. Determined to make enough money to give up his violent ways and pay for the cornea transplants that could restore Jennie's sight, Jeff accepts one final deadly assignment. Having completed the assassination, he speeds off from the scene of a crime in a spectacular motorboat chase with the police. 
The chase is the first move in an extended game of cat and mouse with his pursuer, Inspector Lee, who eventually becomes his ally when the two of them face down the entire Hong Kong underworld in an apocalyptic shootout. By that time, Jeff and Lee are calling each by their pet names, Dumbo and Mickey Mouse. The final confrontation with the mobsters who have double-crossed Jeff takes place -- where else? -- in a pristine chapel filled with lighted candles, a flock of white doves and a statue of the Virgin Mary. 
"The Killer" tells two love stories. The first is about Jeff and Jennie. The second is about Jeff and Lee, antagonists who reluctantly recognize each other as kindred spirits: pure souls who live by a higher code of honor than those around them. Several weepy speeches about friendship, loyalty and honor set the stage for their late-blooming bond to be tested. 
The movie is the third collaboration between the director and the Asian superstar Chow Yun-Fat, who portrays Jeff. The actor glides through the role wearing an enigmatic Mona Lisa smile and gazing down at the world with a dreamy-eyed sadness. At once poetic and suave, the nearly invincible Jeff never loses his cool. Even in the shootouts, in which he is typically outnumbered 10 to 1, he gracefully brandishes two guns, casually shooting from the hip and rarely wasting a bullet, while wearing an expression of anguished sorrow. 
The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong's fog-shrouded skyline. The director repeatedly places the viewer at the center of the crossfire and turns the gyrating camera into the next best thing to a lethal weapon.

‽Misplaced‽,‽In "Misplaced," a proud Polish woman and her teen-age son immigrate to the United States for political reasons, and rebuild their lives in an environment that is often less than friendly. Settling with relatives in Virginia, they must contend with economic hardship, lack of suitable job opportunities, loneliness, and the supercilious behavior of those not eager to make them feel welcome in a new land. 
Halina Nowak (Elzbieta Czyzewska) quickly finds that her mother and half-sister cannot easily accommodate her in their small suburban house, and that after years of separation the family is less than close. ("I always wanted to bring you over, but the time just went by," says Halina's mother, played by Viveca Lindfors.) Halina and her son, Jacek (John Cameron Mitchell), move to a drab apartment and begin the difficult task of making it a home. Meanwhile, Halina also looks for a job. Though she is an accomplished linguist, she can find nothing better suited to her talents than cleaning work at Voice of America headquarters. 
The film -- which opens today at the Quad Cinema -- proceeds quietly, and without any more fire than its title suggests, to show how Halina and Jacek gradually put down roots. As directed by Louis Yansen, who makes his feature debut with this semiautobiographical story, it is often attractively sincere. The women's roles, though, are written (by Mr. Yansen and Thomas DeWolfe) as virtual catnip for any actress equipped to convey noble suffering, and both Miss Czyzewska and Miss Lindfors have many opportunities to play this to the hilt. 
Miss Lindfors, in one scene, confronts street hooligans and shames them into going away. Miss Czyzewska, in another, corners two selfish yuppie women and shames    them    into giving her an audition as a Voice of America announcer. "I am just a cleaning woman, is that it?" she shouts, bristling with anger. Together with Miss Lindfors, who is also supposed to be doing work of this kind, they make the two most stately, dignified cleaning women imaginable. That may be Mr. Yansen's point, but it is overworked. 
Jacek's section of the story is more easygoing. Mr. Mitchell does extremely well in conveying this high school student's shyness, intelligence and eagerness to fit in. Jacek is as obviously superior to his new surroundings as his mother is, but he is less inclined to say so, even to the teen-age girls who make fun of his loud, low-budget American clothes. Mr. Mitchell's Jacek has enough quiet dash to make those teen-age girls eventually see the error of their ways. 
Mr. Yansen's direction is plain and sometimes even blunt, but he succeeds in offering a clear and affecting sense of the Nowaks' ordeal. When Jacek struggles to learn the Gettysburg Address and complains of difficulty with the word "unalienable," his mother erupts with the anger that runs tacitly throughout the story. "A word is too hard?" she cries. "You tell me what is so hard about a word!"

‽Kindergarten Cop‽,‽There are still a few skeptics who laugh at Arnold Schwarzenegger's overwrought muscles, Austrian accent and commitment to the monotone school of acting, but no one laughs at Arnold Schwarzenegger better than Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. As the dense brother who towered over his twin, Danny DeVito, in the hit "Twins," and as the mind-altered hero who tossed off tongue-in-cheek remarks in last summer's blockbuster "Total Recall," he turned his he-man persona to shrewd comic advantage. In "Kindergarten Cop," he plays off the Schwarzenegger image more gleefully and successfully than ever before. 
That is not quite enough to save the movie from its lame, predictable script, even though the concept sounds foolproof: send a tough, hulking policeman undercover as a kindergarten teacher, where he will be at the mercy of screaming whirlwinds tiny enough to snap at his kneecaps. Like "Twins," which was also directed by Ivan Reitman, nothing in "Kindergarten Cop" is as funny as the idea of it. The film relies on obvious jokes, like the little boy who announces to the class the anatomical differences between men and women; those jokes are repeated like nervous tics. But Mr. Schwarzenegger is so appealing, relaxed and genial in this role that his fans are not likely to ask for more and even his detractors are likely to be happily surprised. 
All the Arnold tricks are in place here. He is a thick-skinned, soft-hearted guy named John Kimble, with an excuse for carrying a gun, a fish-out-of-water situation and a stockpile of wise asides. At the start, Kimble chases a ponytailed drug dealer named Crisp through a mall. Handcuffing a witness to the dead body Crisp has just gunned down, Kimble says, "Don't go anywhere." 
Crisp, a man so arrogant and chichi he must be a bad guy, has a gun-toting mama, played by Carroll Baker. And he is after his former wife and son, who have changed their names and fled to the small town of Astoria, Ore. The police know that the child is in the Astoria Elementary School kindergarten class, and Kimble's job is to identify the family before Crisp does. 
Never mind how Kimble gets to play teacher, the job intended for his partner (Pamela Reed). That is just part of the draggy plot exposition that leads to his traumatic first day at school. He survives the experience, but just barely, by distracting the class with his pet ferret, who becomes their mascot. 
He narrows down the list of suspects by playing a game called: "Who is your daddy? What does he do?" The children stand up and say things that are meant to be cute but are usually groaners; the boy obsessed with anatomy is the son of a gynecologist. No one says, "Daddy is a drug dealer," but Kimble narrows the possibilities to a few little boys with fishy stories, and goes on to better games, like "Police School." He puts the children through drills that make them look like miniature marines. 
"You kids are soft!" he growls. "You're not disciplined!" They march in formation chanting, "Too much homework makes me sick." Kimble, of course, turns out to be a wonderful, gentle teacher. Given every chance to mug and go for broad comedy, Mr. Schwarzenegger instead makes Kimble endearingly vulnerable. In "Twins," he seemed to be trying hard to be sweet and funny; here it seems to come naturally. 
Ms. Reed's major function is to promote the romance between Kimble and a pretty young teacher (Penelope Ann Miller), whose son happens to be in his class. The plot is filled with coincidences dreamed up in movieland. But Ms. Reed's is not a thankless role. In one of the funniest scenes, she masquerades as Kimble's sister, Ursula, complete with her own version of the Schwarzenegger accent. 
Unfortunately, the story takes a sharp right turn at the end, veering into violent action that makes "Kindergarten Cop" unsafe for kindergarten children. Imagine taking a small child to a movie in which a stranger arrives and holds a gun to his own son's head, and in which the boy watches his teacher, his father and his grandmother shoot it out in the boys' lavatory. The shoot-'em-up finale is another Schwarzenegger staple, but it is a jarring wrong note in this otherwise congenial film.

‽The Bonfire of the Vanities‽,‽THE value (and fun) of Tom Wolfe's long, Dickensian-detailed, tirelessly satiric novel, "The Bonfire of the Vanities," is in its democratic approach to ridicule. All men are born trashy.  Those few who aren't have trashiness thrust upon them. 
No one entirely escapes Mr. Wolfe's scorn in his withering, moralistic tale about opportunists running amok in New York City in the mid-1980's. 
They are all there, everyone you might have met at a Park Avenue dinner party or (if you aren't invited to Park Avenue dinner parties) read about in the gossip columns or on page 2 or 3 of the tabloids. The cast is big.  It includes even those who are viewed as supporting players on the edge of the screen in the television coverage of a scandal. 
Wall Street wizards, ambitious politicians, their flunkies, Harlem punks, society women who are see-through thin, ministers with an eye for the main chance, interior decorators, fashionable poets, discarded wives, mistresses on the prowl, plus the cops, the stretch-limo drivers and the other faceless, functional people who service them. 
They are white, black, gentile, Jewish. Mr. Wolfe is an equal-opportunity chronicler of the absurd. 
His New York City is fictional, though it closely resembles the one over which Edward I. Koch presided as Mayor, when Ronald and Nancy Reagan were the pace setters in the White House. 
"The Bonfire of the Vanities" is a historical novel about a time and place in which everything and everybody had a price. This ecumenical approach is what gives "Bonfire" its tone. By being consistent, the novel transcends its own cynicism to become healthily skeptical. 
This is just what Brian De Palma's gross, unfunny movie adaptation does not do. 
The story is a good one. Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks), a well-born successful Wall Street bond salesman, sneaks off to meet his mistress, Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), when she comes into Kennedy Airport from Italy. 
On the way back to town, they take the wrong exit from the Triborough Bridge, winding up in unknown reaches of the Bronx, fearful for their lives as well as for his very expensive, showy imported car. 
After many twists and turns, they come to a lonely dead end where, while they are stopped, they're threatened by two young black men. There's a scuffle. With Maria behind the wheel, they make a desperate getaway, leaving one man badly hit as they run. 
From this small beginning, and faster than an ailanthus tree in a vacant lot, a giant scandal grows. 
When the feckless Sherman, self-styled "master of the universe" for his wheeling and dealing on Wall Street, is arraigned on hit-and-run charges, he becomes everybody's ticket to fame, fortune, community influence or political office. 
The racist Jewish District Attorney Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who wants to be Mayor, sees the case as his chance to convince black voters that he is no racist. The Reverend Bacon (John Hancock), a militant black clergyman, becomes the adviser to and spokesman for the injured man's family. While hospitalized, the injured man himself (Patrick Malone) is made over into a symbol of the city's oppressed, a dedicated scholar and victim of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant heedlessness. 
Orchestrating much of the hoopla is Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), a reporter for a tabloid called The City Light, who uses the story to save his job and then blows it up into a series that wins him a Pulitzer Prize. 
This is the plot, or the bones of it, anyway. It's a touchy one, with something to offend everyone. The novel works, at least in part, because it is so comically rude and so minutely detailed. 
In adapting it to the screen, Mr. De Palma and Michael Cristofer, who wrote the screenplay, have made a series of wrong decisions that have the effect of both softening the satire and making it seem more uncomfortably racist than the Wolfe original. 
As if to echo the novel's overstatement, and to tell the audience that what it's seeing is truth exaggerated, Mr. De Palma and his cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond, favor the use of lenses that give ordinary people the faces of gargoyles, and oddball camera angles that suggest a horror film more often than a social satire. 
The sets are alternately too much -- too fancy -- and too little, that is, utterly realistic. The movie never seems to know what it's supposed to be. It wobbles. 
The casting isn't ideal. Mr. Hanks comes off best as the bewildered victim. He's nobody's idea of a prototypical Yale man, which is the way he's described in the novel, but he's a good comic actor. It also helps that Sherman McCoy, a sort of late-20th-century Candide, is required to do little more than respond to the viciousness of others. 
Mr. Willis and Miss Griffith play their roles as straight as possible, but still seem to be cyphers. Their roles are flat, but without having the clear-cut definition of the cartoon figures that surround them. 
This is why the members of the supporting cast seem so much more vivid. They play one-dimensional comic types who get on and off fast: Mr. Abraham, Kim Cattrall (Mr. Hanks's socially proper wife), Saul Rubinek (an ambitious but dimwitted assistant district attorney), Robert Stephens (a publisher possibly suggested by Rupert Murdoch). 
Off in left field somewhere is Morgan Freeman, who appears as the movie's conscience, an invention of Mr. Cristofer and Mr. De Palma. He is the black judge (in the novel, he is Jewish) who, at the end of the film, delivers an upbeat sermon on justice (also an invention) devised to deny the validity of just about everything that has gone on before. 
There's nothing especially wrong with the words, but they don't fit the movie they're in. 
More surprising is what seems to be the film's technical flaws. There are times when the dialogue sounds disconnected from the speaker, as if post-synchronized. Some scenes are awkwardly staged, including the initial confrontation in the Bronx. In one brief love scene, Miss Griffith's body appears to be so perfect as to look surgically reconstructed. 
Perhaps not, but "The Bonfire of the Vanities" is so wildly uneven that everything in it seems open to question.   "The Bonfire of the Vanities" has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes partial nudity and vulgar language.

‽The Russia House‽,‽"The Russia House," the screen adaptation of John le Carre's post-Cold War spy novel, comes on like a drill sergeant who talks fast and feeds the recruits more information than they can possibly absorb, the aim being to intimidate them into woozy submission. 
There is the same overwhelming aggressiveness to the first 30 minutes of "The Russia House." The aim in this case is apparently to convince the audience that the film is far more complex than, in fact, it ever becomes. 
The scene is not set, it is fractured.  There is a lot of cross-cutting among locations and characters not immediately identified, with conversations heard on the sound track that don't connect to the images. There is, overall, a simulated sense of peril promising suspense that never comes. 
As directed by Fred Schepisi and written by Tom Stoppard, "The Russia House" is confused and dim, far less complex, and even far less fun, than almost any le Carre work yet brought to the screen, excluding "The Little Drummer Girl." 
The movie also betrays what could be the desperation of a novelist trying to wring one last tale out of the Cold War, which, in light of current events, is beginning to look as if it were a golden era of political, economic and social tranquillity. 
"The Russia House" is about Barley Blair (Sean Connery), a hard-drinking, easygoing, healthily skeptical London publisher who suddenly finds himself recruited by British intelligence. His mission: to find the Russian author of a manuscript, originally intended for Barley, which reveals Soviet military might to be that of a second-rate power. 
It turns out that the author is a brilliant Russian scientist, code-named Dante (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who had been charmed by Barley's independence of mind when the two met some months earlier at a writers' conference in the Soviet Union. 
Though Gorbachev's Soviet Union is now open, Dante tells Barley, it is not so open that it would sanction the publication of military secrets of such an embarrassing nature. Dante's stated aim is to shake up the Soviet military bureaucracy and to persuade the West that, threatened by no real threat, it can disarm. 
Barley clearly doesn't read spy novels. In the course of his mission, he is astonished to realize that the members of the military-intelligence complexes in Great Britain and the United States share their Soviet counterparts' distaste for such a breakthrough in international relations. 
The military-intelligence people care more about job security than the fate of the planet. Barley, the hunter, becomes the hunted. 
That is more or less the substance of "The Russia House," which has been photographed at what looks to have been great expense in the Soviet Union, Portugal, Canada and England. The locations in Leningrad and in and around Moscow are splendidly photogenic. 
Also photogenic, and much more than that, is Michelle Pfeiffer, who gives the film's most persuasive performance as the Russian woman who acts as the initial go-between for Dante and Barley. It's not a terribly rich role but it's a clean-cut one, and Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie. 
Mr. Brandauer, also, is good, but everyone else seems upstaged by a combination of fancified screenplay and direction. 
That includes the usually magnetic Mr. Connery, whose forceful screen presence is at odds with Barley, a glib, lazy sort of man who discovers himself during this adventure. Mr. Connery goes through the movie as if driving in second gear. 
The supporting cast includes Roy Scheider, James Fox, J. T. Walsh and Ken Russell (the director), all acting like actors trying very hard to find the interesting aspects of characters who have none. They appear as intelligence and military men of various temperaments. 
The only one who stands out is Mr. Russell. With his unpressed white hair and his beetling way of walking, he behaves in the busy, gadfly fashion one would expect of the man who made "The Music Lovers," "Tommy" and "Salome's Last Dance." 
There is evidence of Mr. Stoppard's wit in the dialogue, but the lines are not easily spoken, which is not to say that they are unspeakable. They are clumsy. Sometimes they are even over-ripe, as when the Pfeiffer character, recalling a love affair, tells Barley that she lost her innocence the same night that Soviet tanks entered Prague. 
The narrative structure is a mess.  Whether this is the responsibility of Mr. Stoppard, Mr. Schepisi or of the film editors, working independently, I've no idea. It is frequently inscrutable.   "The Russia House," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language.

‽Almost an Angel‽,‽In "Almost an Angel," Paul Hogan plays a jocular born-again Christian, a former thief named Terry Dean who begins proselytizing after being hit by a car. Wandering through the film amiably and giving out copious free advice, Terry becomes so devout that he assures a character whose loved one has just died that this is barely even bad news. It will be a true miracle if "Almost an Angel" attracts even a small audience, let alone finds its way to a place alongside Mr. Hogan's "Crocodile Dundee" in box-office heaven. 
Mr. Hogan remains a modest, benign comic figure, but the energy that has been spent on keeping him busy here could barely run a light bulb. His own screenplay, which has him dressing up as Rod Stewart and Willie Nelson for two brief sight gags, otherwise gives him little to do but dispense homilies, befriend a paraplegic (Elias Koteas), help disadvantaged children and court a nice but uninteresting young woman (Linda Kozlowski, Mr. Hogan's familiar co-star). 
Also in the film is Charlton Heston, appearing in long, flowing robes and a white beard as the kind of deity to whom Mr. Hogan can make wisecracks. As Terry, he makes frequent asides to God. "Listen, mate," he whispers confidentially at one point, "I guess you've been asked this question a million times, but . . . is Elvis with you?" Unless one finds that desperately funny, the rest of the film is hopeless. 
"Almost an Angel" was non descriptly directed by John Cornell, whose credits include Mr. Hogan's Australian television show, Mr. Hogan's most successful commercials, and the marketing and television presentation of World Series Cricket, as well as "Crocodile Dundee."   "Almost an Angel" is rated PG-13 ("Parents strongly cautioned"). It contains mildly irreverent dialogue.

‽Mermaids‽,‽The flamboyant Mrs. Flax is too much, which means that she's just about right for Cher, who plays her to the teeth (and nose and hair) in Richard Benjamin's sweet-natured new comedy, "Mermaids." 
Mrs. Flax dresses in a way that might be expected to cause male passers-by to walk into trees. Skirts are tight. Necklines plunge. Wigs tower. She's not the sort of mom who bakes apple pies. 
Every meal at home is presented on a platter, often with toothpicks, as if it were something to nibble on with cocktails. Mrs. Flax's favorite supper: finger food followed by marshmallow kebabs. 
"She thinks anything more represents too much of a commitment," says her teen-age daughter, Charlotte (Winona Ryder). 
Mrs. Flax is ahead of her time, which is 1963. She depends on no man to support her, to help raise her two daughters or to give her more than passing sexual comfort. She is liberated with a relentless vengeance, the sort of character that is beloved in fiction and hell-on-wheels in fact. 
"Mermaids," adapted by the English writer June Roberts from the novel by Patty Dann, is a terribly gentle if wisecracking comedy about the serious business of growing up. 
Though Cher's cheeky, broad, comically self-assured performance dominates the movie, "Mermaids" is really about Charlotte, who is 15 years old and who is a startling combination of sophistication and ignorance. 
As played by Miss Ryder, who is enchanting and funny, and firmly in control of every scene not handed to Cher, Charlotte is a potentially rich character. Miss Ryder is so good, in fact, that "Mermaids" might have dared to be a tougher, more satisfying movie than the stylish sitcom it is.  "Mermaids" is a smooth, unexceptional entertainment about coming of age in a world where truly bad things happen only on television. 
Because the year is 1963, much is made of the television coverage of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, but life in East Port, Mass., where the Flaxes are living temporarily, is never profoundly threatened nor, for that matter, experienced. 
Charlotte is going through all sorts of contradictory emotions. She's in love with Roman Catholicism, especially with female saints and martyrs. She even has a shrine in her room. 
At one point her mother, preparing for a date, sashays by the door and finds Charlotte on her knees in front of the shrine. "Charlotte," Mrs. Flax says dryly, "we're Jewish." 
Though Charlotte wants to devote herself to the church, she is also obsessed by erotic desires, which are soon centered on a good-looking, utterly vacuous young man who drives her school bus. Eventually, the same young man catches Mrs. Flax's fancy, with predictable emotional ramifications for Charlotte. 
For most of the film, Mrs. Flax's attentions are given to the local shoe-store owner, Lou Landsky, which is a secondary role that Bob Hoskins transforms into a fine comic turn. 
Lou is nobody's idea of a Romeo, certainly not Mrs. Flax's. Yet by sheer nerve, wit and common sense he manages to melt some of the ice surrounding Mrs. Flax's emotional reserve. 
The youngest Flax is Kate, nicely played by Christina Ricci. Each of the three Flaxes is meant to suggest some aspect of the mythical creatures of the film's title. Each is in some manner caught between two worlds, at home in neither. 
The title might also refer to the fact that in a New Year's Eve sequence, Mrs. Flax goes to a costume party dressed in the kind of mermaid costume that would wow them in Las Vegas. The credits say the costume was "built by" Patty Spinale and Gail Baldoni of the Boston Ballet Company. 
The performance inside the costume was engineered entirely by Cher. 
"Mermaids" has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some vulgar language and mild sexuality.

‽
‽Look Who's Talking Too‽,‽First the good news: Mikey, the boy whose street-smart thoughts have been given voice by Bruce Willis in "Look Who's Talking" and now "Look Who's Talking Too," looks almost old enough to speak for himself. In a world ruled by reason, that would make a third go-round out of the question. 
Sadly, a movie sequel as desperate as "Look Who's Talking Too" is not the product of a reasonable world. It should be noted, for starters, that Mikey's mother, Mollie (Kirstie Alley), had a second child at the end of the original film, a girl who sounded like Joan Rivers and who has not been heard from again. 
Instead, in "Look Who's Talking Too," Mollie and her husband, James (John Travolta), become the parents of an entirely different daughter, this one also named Julie, with a wisecracking inner voice supplied by Roseanne Barr. Aside from this, and from James having regained his figure, very little has happened to these parents in the interim. The new film, written by Amy Heckerling (who also directed) and Neal Israel, has virtually nothing beyond the talking-baby gimmick to keep it going. 
A few indications of just how bankrupt this becomes: 
The new film is constantly bolstered by pop songs ("Catch Us if You Can," sing boisterous sperm cells racing to attack an egg), and has many more musical romps than it has plot turns. The two children are, of course, seen frolicking to the tune of "I Got You Babe." "Sea of Love," which should be considered off-limits after its use as another film's title    and    in a ubiquitous perfume ad campaign, is also included. 
The automatic montage recapitulating all the fun Mollie and James have had together comes midway through it, instead of being saved for the end. The fun looks tired, anyhow. 
A lot of the jokes are about toilet training, including stories told by another baby (with voice by Damon Wayans) about a fearsome creature called Mr. Toilet Man. This being actually appears, in the form of a talking toilet with voice by Mel Brooks. 
The jokes that aren't about diapers are mostly about accounting. 
And the dramatic moment when Julie takes her first steps is not even accompanied by the strains of "Thus Spake Zarathustra," as might have been expected. Instead, it's the music of the Tri-Star leaping horse logo. (The horse also talks during the film's actual opening credits.) 
The film's few mild laughs, which occur in spite of all this, mostly come from Ms. Barr's histrionic readings of a baby's self-important thoughts. "Well, at least I've achieved most of my goals," she sighs in utero, while imagining she will perish at birth.  "Will this pain    ever    go away?" she wails, upon receiving her first injection. Mr. Willis, whose savvy sound for Mikey has indeed been a valuable contribution to the film's formula, adds some amusingly pointed complaints about sibling rivalry. ("She's up! She's mobile! She's movin'! She's headin' right for my toys!") But for the most part, the voices are a lot funnier than the dialogue. 
Among the non-baby actors, who are mostly here to be upstaged, Mr. Travolta is again easygoing and likable, though largely wasted. A sequence in which he dances like Elvis for a kiddie gym class ought to be show stopping, but is instead so clumsily shot and edited that it falls flat. Ms. Alley's sitcom timing, while unsurprising, is just right for generating signs of life where none really exist. Also in the cast are Elias Koteas and Olympia Dukakis as Mollie's oddball brother and mother, though neither has much to do. 
Among the more dubious touches in "Look Who's Talking Too" are a conception sequence that is staged as an attack and a burning-house sequence that finds the film's two child stars (Lorne Sussman and Megan Milner) toddling unsupervised through a flaming kitchen. It's alarming even to wonder how the latter was filmed. 
"Look Who's Talking Too" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It includes sexual situations, profanity and kiddie-level bathroom jokes. Look Who's Talking Too  Directed by Amy Heckerling; written by Ms. Heckerling and Neal Israel; director of photography, Thomas Del Ruth; edited by Debra Chiate; music by David Kitay; production designer, Reuben Freed; produced by Jonathan D.

‽
‽The Sheltering Sky‽,‽Bernardo Bertolucci's "Sheltering Sky" is about sliding over the edge into oblivion, but going in style. 
The time is shortly after the end of World War II, when the civilized world is still trying to rediscover the reassuring boundaries of commonplace routine. Three exceptions are Port Moresby, his wife, Kit, and their friend George Tunner. 
Port (John Malkovich), an American composer who no longer composes, Kit (Debra Winger), who once wrote a Broadway play that received respectful but unenthusiastic notices, and Tunner (Campbell Scott), who gives cocktail parties on Long Island, arrive by tramp steamer at Tangier, Morocco, en route to the Sahara. 
They might have gone to Italy but the war, at great inconvenience to them, has messed it up. 
The way they enter the film is significant -- Port, followed by Kit, followed by Tunner. Each appears first as a head, then as a head supported by a torso, and finally in full figure as each climbs the steps from the small-boat landing below to reach the sun-drenched quay above. 
They stand there, for a few moments at loose ends, suddenly oppressed by the astonishing intensity of the North African heat. In response to a remark by Tunner, Port says rather grandly that they are certainly not tourists. Says Kit, they are travelers. 
By their definition, tourists merely pass through on a fixed schedule, always to return someplace other. Travelers move at their own speed, remaining in one spot a week, a month or a year or two, as the mood dictates. Travelers need never return. 
Yet these three are like tourists in that they are in transit, and time is running out. 
Port, Kit and Tunner are separated not only from the boredom of the known world they have left behind, but also from one another. Forever. This human condition is the illusive substance of "The Sheltering Sky," possibly Mr. Bertolucci's most seductive, most hypnotic movie. 
The film opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse. 
"The Sheltering Sky" is a long, beautifully modulated cry of despair. It's the sort of dark, romantic movie that only Mr. Bertolucci ("The Conformist," "Last Tango in Paris" and "The Last Emperor") could bring off without allowing audiences to wonder, even briefly, about the self-absorption of the characters. 
That they never seem foolish or superfluous is due to the intensity of the film itself, adapted by Mark Peploe and Mr. Bertolucci from the 1949 Paul Bowles novel. 
Whether or not the movie will have the same impact on someone who hasn't read the novel is difficult to say. It is, after all, impossible to disremember a novel as vivid as "The Sheltering Sky" once it has been read. 
Yet the film somehow manages to find cinema equivalents to the Bowles prose in which exterior and inner landscapes are evoked with the same fine clarity of expression. The novel sort of browses through the minds of Port, Kit and Tunner, and even through the minds of some of the pragmatic, nameless Africans they meet in their journey to the interior. 
The novel is very much of its own immediate postwar era, when tales of alienation were on the brink of becoming as fashionable as Christian Dior's "new look," which put women into skirts that virtually denied the existence of their legs. 
Mr. Bowles's vocabulary evokes another kind of chic doom. 
"There was a certitude of sadness at the core of his consciousness," he writes of Port at one point. "She," in reference to Kit, "had no reactions at all; her entire personality withdrew from sight." Or, of Port, "He had long since come to deny all purpose to the phenomenon of existence." 
These are not easy attitudes to animate. "Glacial deadness" (another of the novelist's phrases) is not something that leaps off the screen like a chariot race. 
As long as the film is unfolding, though, "The Sheltering Sky" rivets the attention. Only when it ends does the mind go back to wonder what, exactly, it has just seen. 
Would this story of a marriage in stalemate, of lives in stasis, of one couple's desperate attempt to get off dead-center, have been as entertaining if Port were an alienated insurance salesman in Queens and Kit a dissatisfied den mother? 
Probably not, but then that's to take the sociology of the movie (and the novel) more literally than is necessary. "The Sheltering Sky" is not about insurance salesmen and it could be set nowhere but in North Africa. 
The Sahara is a magnificent metaphor for a universe that is overwhelming in its vastness and complexity, but also as simple and finite as a grain of sand. 
Like the novel, which is piercing and specific even when it is describing emotional inertia, the movie makes the unhappy love story of Port and Kit seem vital, and inseparable from the terrain in which it all comes to an end. This adaptation represents a tough job unusually well done. 
For the most part, the screenplay successfully translates arcane inner thoughts into dialogue that is speakable and sometimes even mordantly funny. Mr. Bertolucci also observes Port and Kit and Tunner in such a way that a remarkable amount of the Bowles novel is reflected in behavior and manner. 
The only time a certain desperation becomes apparent is when Mr. Bowles himself, now a well-preserved 80 years old, is placed in the film frame. He is seen in a couple of sequences set in a Tangier cafe. He serves briefly as a kind of witness to the events, offering comments that, unlike the rest of the dialogue, sound like truncated sentences from a literary work. His wary physical presence might have been enough. 
Reduced to its plot essentials, "The Sheltering Sky" is a sort of existential update on Rudolph Valentineo's old chestnut, "The Sheik." 
Port, Kit and Tunner move in edgy stages farther and farther from civilization into the desert. As the geography becomes more barren and more exotic and more fly-infested, they become more desperate. 
Port wants to shake himself out of his spiritual lethargy. In Tangier, he has an erotic encounter with a young, full-breasted Arab girl and, for some reason, is even more satisfied when he is beaten and robbed afterward. 
Kit longs for Port to renew the passion that seems worn out after 10 years of marriage. They have two brief sexual encounters, but his mind is not on her. She turns to the handsome, comparatively square, adoring Tunner, whom she can barely tolerate. 
(In this sort of literature, characters are inevitably bored to the teeth by circumstances that would be dreams come true for many readers and moviegoers. The ruder North African smells might not delight, but they can't be shared by either a novel or a movie.) 
Along the way they meet a voracious harpy of an Englishwoman (Jill Bennett), a travel writer and photographer, and her pudgy alcoholic son (Timothy Spall), who's also a thief and, eventually, the story's catalyst.  Port comes down with typhoid, but still he and Kit push on to the south. 
There are revelations and reconciliations and a final act of what amounts to remarkable, positive renunciation. More cannot be revealed. 
Mr. Malkovich and Miss Winger are extraordinarily fine as the lovers, each being just idiosyncratic enough to take the curse off the exoticism in which the movie is awash. Mr. Scott's role is that of straight man to the two crooked personalities he idolizes. 
Miss Bennett, who died not long after the film was completed, and Mr. Spall are viciously funny. Eric Vu-An, a ballet dancer of French and Vietnamese parentage, makes a brief appearance in a role that could have been played by Valentino, though in a very different kind of movie. 
"The Sheltering Sky" is stunning to look at (Vittorio Storaro was the cameraman), but it is never simply picturesque. It mesmerizes. 
At one point in the novel, Mr. Bowles writes of Port, "It takes energy to invest life with meaning, and at present this energy was lacking." 
It's one of the contradictions built into such fiction that it also takes tremendous energy and skill to write a novel, or make a movie, about isolation of such a profound sort. Mr. Bertolucci's energy and skill match those of Mr. Bowles. 
"The Sheltering Sky," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or guardian), includes full frontal nudity.

‽Havana‽,‽The romance of Sydney Pollack's sprawling, atmospheric "Havana" is real, but it has almost nothing to do with love. Instead it concerns a place, the city of the title, which is hurtling toward irrevocable change and is very near the brink. The year is 1958, the time a densely eventful week between Christmas Eve and New Year's, in the last moments before the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista's regime. The mood, as shaded by these circumstances, is one of abandon, denial, desperate festiveness and mad risk-taking in the face of imminent danger. 
Drawn across this wildly colorful canvas is a halting, equivocal love story in shades of gray. "Havana" brings together Jack Weil (Robert Redford), an inveterate gambler ready to test himself by taking the chance of a lifetime, and Bobby Duran (Lena Olin), a much younger, more mundane beauty who is linked by marriage to Fidel Castro's cause. At her most blandly idealistic, Bobby talks of the revolutionary spirit as being "like a song people sing together." 
"You want to change the world, Bobby?" Jack counters, once the two have established a bantering conversational intimacy, if not much of a physical one. "Change me." But in spite of Mr. Pollack's best efforts, a screenplay (by Judith Rascoe and David Rayfiel) that devotes long and loving analysis to Jack and Bobby's uneasy involvement, and most of all a seemingly irresistible dramatic model (namely "Casablanca"), the problems of these two little people never truly count for much more than a hill of beans. 
Why not? Casting is part of the reason, and not simply because the two stars seem so noticeably incompatible. Mr. Redford, intuitive and dashing as ever in scenes that let him match wits with male actors who are his contemporaries, looks weathered and remote beside the fresh-faced Miss Olin, who for her part appears barely friendly at times. Mutual respect and admiration flow intermittently between them. But there are no real surprises, and certainly no sparks. 
Mr. Redford's great strength, especially in other films Mr. Pollack has directed (among them "Out of Africa," "Three Days of the Condor" and "The Way We Were"), is an ability to turn diffidence into a form of flirtation, exploring the hazy area between contact and escape. But "Havana" treats him as a romantic aggressor rather than an elusive prize, so that he is in fact more magnetic during other parts of this story than he is during its love scenes. The film's determinedly amorous moments are not helped by the screenplay, which swings unpredictably between the moodily eloquent and the merely weary. "You are    seriously    beautiful," Jack must tell Bobby in one scene. "For a moment I was lost -- in a sweet place, but lost," she says much later. 
Jack and Bobby meet on shipboard, where he is caught up in a card game; soon he and this beautiful stranger have joined forces to attempt a greater gamble. Bobby enlists Jack to smuggle contraband from the ship into the city, and not until he is back in Havana does Jack grasp the real purpose of this: Bobby is the wife of a prominent revolutionary leader (Raul Julia, in a hearty though uncredited appearance) and is deeply linked to the cause. By the time Jack understands, he is deeply involved in his own right, fascinated by Bobby if not by her political mission. 
Meanwhile, Jack pursues other interests in Havana. He makes contact with a jaded, knowing casino operator (played with a fine wryness by Alan Arkin), and positions himself to await a big gambling score. After Bobby and her husband disappear during a military raid, Jack finds himself playing cards with their captors, perhaps even their killers (among them Tomas Milian, as a memorably cynical Cuban officer). There is, in this authentically high stakes game, an irony and forboding that give the film a welcome toughness. "These people want to bring down everything you're here for!" exclaims one of Jack's new poker-playing acquaintances, speaking aptly of the imminent revolution. 
The glittering decadence of this culture on the verge of collapse is in fact the film's most fascinating aspect, and Mr. Pollack has re-created it extravagantly. Filmed in the Dominican Republic, "Havana" presents its potent and expressive vision of the title city as an extension of its denizens' state of mind. Mr. Arkin's casino operator is quick to point out that the all-out dissoluteness of this nearly extinct Havana, a place of gambling dens and strip joints and lazy all-night debauches (Mr. Redford has a casual tryst with two women early in the story), is somehow mutable and even portable. If Havana should cease to be the right setting for these activities, Mr. Arkin says reasonably, then the activities will simply move to another part of the world. 
Among the film's most stunning images of cataclysmic change is its New Year's Eve stampede of diamond-decked revelers in evening clothes, who are frantically fleeing the wolf at the door. At moments like this, "Havana" truly captures the electrifying peril of its place and time. And Jack Weil, with his passion for gambling, becomes one of the rare spectators with a clear view of the historic events unfolding around him. Gamblers are drawn to the card games in Havana, he says at one point, "because they're looking for something they can do something about." 
"Havana" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, mild profanity and sexually suggestive situations.

‽The Rookie‽,‽"The Rookie," directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is a jokey buddy-cop movie in which car thieves are the perpetrators, but the highlight is not a fight, a brawl, a shoot-out or even a chase. 
It's a scene in which Mr. Eastwood puts himself in the position of Pearl White, in another example of the sort of role reversals that have become so popular in movies these days. 
Strapped to a chair, his hands tied behind him, Mr. Eastwood is sexually assaulted by Sonia Braga, still best known here for "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands." They are a well-matched pair, both having been around the block a few times. 
Mr. Eastwood plays a veteran Los Angeles cop, whom time has made so sere that he looks as flammable as a dead pine tree. Miss Braga is the karate-chopping cocaine-sniffing hit woman for the car thieves. 
Unlike Miss White, whose ramparts were forever threatened but never breached, Mr. Eastwood somehow successfully submits to his captor. How can he resist? Miss Braga begins her mating dance by slicing his forehead with a razor blade, then threatening him with emasculation. 
It's all meant in good fun, but it isn't. It's tired. 
"The Rookie" is an astonishingly empty movie to come from Mr. Eastwood. 
As a director, he sometimes overreaches himself ("Bird"), but his ambitions are usually noble ("White Hunter, Black Heart"). When not thinking grandly, he has made some effective, entertaining westerns and action movies, including "Pale Rider" and "Heartbreak Ridge." 
The screenplay for "The Rookie" seems to have been pumped up from a script originally intended as a segment for a half-hour television series.  There's not much of a story. 
Instead, the movie devotes itself to extended set pieces, mostly chases, which are so lazily thought out and edited that the audience is always ready for the twists that are supposed to surprise. Even the Los Angeles locations, including one made memorable by "Beverly Hills Cop," are distractingly familiar. 
Charlie Sheen plays the rookie cop who, in the course of the mayhem, proves himself to his older partner.  Raul Julia appears as the bloodthirsty fiend who masterminds the thefts of the fancy cars, often from the parking lots of expensive restaurants. 
It's a crime but, as social nuisances (and movie subjects) go, this one ranks alongside pigeon feeding. 
"The Rookie" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes vulgar language and explicit violence.

‽Edward Scissorhands‽,‽AT the far end of a suburban enclave, where the houses huddle together like a candy-colored wagon train, there stands a monument to lonely genius. Atop a forbidding gray mountain, in yet another of the strange and ingenious outposts that the heroes of Tim Burton's films ("Batman," "Beetlejuice," "Pee-wee's Big Adventure") call home, Edward Scissorhands lives in isolation. He uses his extraordinary gifts to create magical artworks that, he imagines, no one will ever see. 
Edward has apparently hidden here for a long time, with nary a trip to the grocery store. But one day, as seems perfectly reasonable in the ripe, fanciful pop universe in which "Edward Scissorhands" unfolds, a thoughtful Avon lady (Dianne Wiest) pays a visit. Seeing Edward, she immediately grasps that he has a problem and sweetly imagines that it can be solved with kindness, not to mention the makeup base of exactly the right hue. So the Avon lady brings the outcast back to her home, where he amazes the neighbors with his rare feats of snippery. He's a wizard when it comes to poodles. 
In a sense, Mr. Burton is too. His "Edward Scissorhands" is as crazily single-minded as a majestic feat of dog barbering, with much the same boldness, camp ebullience and fundamentally narrow wit. Like a great chef concocting an exquisite peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich, Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small. In the case of "Edward Scissorhands," which opens today at the Ziegfeld, that something is a tale of misunderstood gentleness and stifled creativity, of civilization's power to corrupt innocence, of a heedless beauty and a kindhearted beast. The film, if scratched with something much less sharp than Edward's fingers, reveals proudly adolescent lessons for us all. 
On, then, to the better side of "Edward Scissorhands": the tremendous cleverness with which Mr. Burton brings these ideas to life. As embodied by Johnny Depp, Edward himself is a stunning creation, with a blackish cupid's-bow mouth and plaintive expression to offset his fright hairdo, abundant scars and potentially lethal hands. 
Those hands, which quiver uncontrollably when Edward experiences strong emotion, are the one aspect of the young man that his creator (played by Vincent Price, who was a hero of Mr. Burton's when the director was still a young Disney animator) neglected to complete. The inventor died just before he could equip Edward with human hands, thus leaving him with these scissor-bladed prototypes. They make a great sight gag, if not a great metaphor. 
As in each of Mr. Burton's films, the production design is the central good idea, perhaps even the sole one.  This time, with production design by Bo Welch ("Beetlejuice") and cinematography by Stefan Czapsky, it involves bright colors in unlikely combinations, for instance, a lavender-suited Avon lady driving a dandelion-yellow car) and fashionably ridiculous late-1950's artifacts placed prominently throughout the characters' bunkerlike homes. On the lawns of these houses, more and more of Edward's singular topiaries -- in the forms of a ballerina, a penguin, a set of bowling pins and so on -- begin to appear. 
It is very much in keeping with the film's fearless, defiant illogic that these shrubbery sculptures should appear where no shrubs grew before. Similarly, the film makes no bones about depicting Winona Ryder as a white-haired granny in the not noticeably futuristic prologue, and as a high school girl, circa 1960, when most of the action takes place. Ms. Ryder, in the former capacity, promises to explain to a grandchild what the story of Edward Scissorhands has to do with snowfall. It's also in keeping with the film's reasoning that the explanation for this, when finally revealed, isn't nearly as interesting as promised. 
Ms. Ryder plays Kim Boggs, the daughter of the Avon lady, Peg, and a dryly deadpan patriarch (played by Alan Arkin). As lovely as she is diffident, she makes an enchanting Beauty to Mr. Depp's poignant, bashful Beast. When Edward first arrives in suburbia, he is so flustered that he scares Kim away. (He also inadvertently punches holes in her waterbed.) But he soon becomes part of the household and part of the community, despite insensitive questions -- like "Do you know about bowling?" -- from the locals. 
Soon Edward is so much at home that he is virtually a household convenience, helping Peg snip threads when she sews. He also becomes extremely popular with the women of the neighborhood, some of them fascinated by his knack for inventing odd haircuts, and one (played with funny flamboyance by Kathy Baker) especially interested in discovering his other talents. The women in the film, with the exceptions of Peg and Kim, are ninnies, but the men are no more flatteringly presented. Kim's boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) is a lout, a bully and the cause of Edward's eventual undoing. 
Among the film's more haunting visual touches, all of which linger much longer than the possible reasons for their inclusion, are the peculiar shrinelike assemblage of clippings in Edward's fireplace; the bladelike beams that open a hole in his roof to the heavens and the inventor's cherished machinery, so pleasantly antiquated that the machines seem to have animal faces. The traces of warmth that spring up unexpectedly, even in the sequence that finds Edward and Kim amid snow and ice, are what save "Edward Scissorhands" from its own potential archness and give it the sweetness of a bona-fide fairy tale. "Edward Scissorhands" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual suggestiveness and occasional rude language.

‽Company Business‽,‽"You're both dinosaurs," a comparatively neutral observer tells the two bewildered former cold war spies in Nicholas Meyer's new espionage melodrama, "Company Business." They are Sam Boyd (Gene Hackman), an American, and Pyotr Grushenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov), a Russian, who have joined forces to flee the coordinated wrath of the Central Intelligence Agency and the K.G.B. 
The neutral observer fails to notice that if the two men are dinosaurs, then their adventure must be antediluvian. 
Though "Company Business," which opened here yesterday, is slickly acted and photographed, it has the monotonous one-two-three, one-two-three tempo of a waltz that begins in Fort Worth and lumbers on to Washington, Berlin and Paris. 
The long-retired Sam is brought back by the C.I.A., the "company" of the title, to effect the swap of a Russian prisoner, Pyotr, for an American U-2 pilot still held in Moscow. 
Things inevitably go wrong. It's not giving anything away to reveal that the C.I.A. isn't up to any good, dealing, as it is, with money provided by a Colombian drug cartel. Sam and Pyotr quickly realize that each is the other's best friend. 
The movie has a funny scene involving a Saudi Arabian arms merchant in Berlin, a rather superfluous scene set in a Berlin drag bar, and a small shootout on the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Mr. Hackman, who has played this role before, and Mr. Baryshnikov, who hasn't, are both sturdy if a little tired. Under the direction of Mr. Meyer, who also wrote the screenplay, the film makes sense without ever being surprising.   "Company Business," which has been rated PG-13 (Some material may be unsuitable for those under 13), includes some vulgar language and violence.   COMPANY BUSINESS

‽Final Approach‽,‽Eric Steven Stahl's film "Final Approach" is a cinematic maze, a high-technology head trip in which the roles of director, film editor, computer animator and sound designer have blurred. 
In the spectacular opening sequences, Col. Jason Halsey (James B.  Sikking), a test pilot flying close to the ground over the Southwestern desert, crashes after his plane is struck by lightning. On waking, he finds himself in the spare, futuristic office of a psychiatrist (Hector Elizondo) who pelts him with questions he cannot answer since he has forgotten everything, including his own name. But slowly, through word-association games and Rorschach-style tests, his past begins to reveal itself in sudden, explosive flashes. 
Tantalizing questions are raised. Is he the subject of some demonic brain transplant? Is it all a dream? Or is the psychiatrist a foreign agent intent on prying military secrets out of him? As much as possible, the film remains inside the mind of a character who is desperate for clues to his own identity and who is terrified that he has gone mad. And in its most effective moments, it produces a roller-coaster sense of mental queasiness. 
It is no surprise to learn that Mr. Stahl, who produced, directed and co-wrote "Final Approach," comes from the world of television commercials, for the movie often has the look and sound of an MTV commercial. The entire film is structured as an extended flashback montage with a multi-layered, wraparound sound track.  But for every breathtaking bit of aerial photography there is something correspondingly banal, like the recurrent silhouette of a nude woman diving. And many of the computer-animated effects serve only as slick, superfluous visual filler. 
As is often the case in films this technologically showy, the cinematic pyrotechnics also camouflage gaping holes in a story whose abrupt, unsatisfying conclusion seems borrowed from Albert Brooks's "Defending Your Life." Until that ending, however, the two leading actors play a smooth game of cat and mouse. Mr. Elizondo glides enigmatically along the line between genial and menacing, and Mr. Sikking undergoes a convincing grand mal seizure.  Final Approach

‽Paper Mask‽,‽"Paper Mask," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is the story of a medical fake whose willfulness knows no bounds. Originally a London hospital aide named Matthew Harris (Paul McGann), he takes on the identity of Dr. Simon Hennessey after Hennessey is killed in an accident. He then applies for a job at a hospital in Bristol without benefit of formal medical training, and quickly tries to achieve a minimal level of proficiency by tutoring himself. "I don't know what you see in these skinny women," says one of Matthew's friends when he finds a teaching skeleton hidden in Matthew's bed. 
Bluffing his way into a privileged position -- the camera lingers fondly on perks like "Doctors Only" signs in hospital parking lots -- he does rather well, under the circumstances. Talent and luck are at least as important to Matthew's success as real knowledge would have been. Intuition helps, too; he is able to make a diagnosis of cirrhosis simply by spotting a bottle of liquor hidden in a patient's bed. Also immeasurably helpful is Christine Taylor (Amanda Donohoe), a smart, sexy emergency-ward nurse who seems at least as knowledgeable as most of the doctors working around her. 
In its detailed depiction of hospital life and various medical crises, the generally engrossing "Paper Mask" has an authentic flavor. Written by John Collee, a doctor who is also a novelist and columnist, the screenplay captures the banter and bravado of young doctors, as well as the tension that would make an emergency ward such a nerve-racking place for on-the-job training. As directed by Christopher Morahan, whose credits include "Jewel in the Crown" for Grenada Television and the very funny film "Clockwise," "Paper Mask" moves briskly and does a lot to make its central character's improbable situation seem real. 
But by the end of the story, in an effort to heighten this material's dramatic possibilities, Matthew's compelling mixture of sweetness and ruthlessness becomes unbalanced. Sheer ambition takes precedence, leading him to take deadly measures to hang onto his medical career. And at that point the film becomes too macabre to remain plausible. The story's last moments, however diabolical, are less interesting than the day-by-day details of Matthew's medical charade. 
Mr. McGann, best known as the "I" of "Withnail and I," does a lot to make Matthew appealing, even when he is seen flushing a wristwatch engraved "Love Mom and Dad" down a toilet to dispose of his old identity. Mr. McGann so ably captures Matthew's opportunistic charm that it becomes difficult to dislike him, even when he turns out to be evil incarnate. Ms. Donohoe gives a lively, game performance and manages to look slinky even while wearing sensible shoes. Production notes point out that she has never had any interest in being a nurse. 
Also in the film's solid cast of stage-trained actors are Tom Wilkinson and Frederick Treves as two senior doctors with reason to suspect the competence of "Dr. Hennessey," and Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Mr. Treves's kindly, devoted wife. Ms. Leigh-Hunt, who may be vividly remembered as a strangler's victim in Alfred Hitchcock's "Frenzy," doesn't fare much better this time around. 
"Paper Mask" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some gore, partial nudity and sexual situations.

‽Close My Eyes‽,‽Contemporary London, as depicted in Stephen Poliakoff's "Close My Eyes," is gripped by a feverish malaise. Construction cranes scar the skyline for as far as the eye can see, and the weather is so hot that people have begun to mutter about the end of the world. There is also grim talk about the AIDS epidemic. And when one of the characters makes a date in the sleazier part of town, his first stop is at a vending machine dispensing condoms. 
In this parched, overheated atmosphere, an incestuous affair between Natalie (Saskia Reeves), a restless young woman who drifts from job to job, and her slightly younger brother Richard (Clive Owen) almost makes sense. In a world where nature seems to have slipped out of balance, it is a way of unconsciously affirming the general state of disorder. 
"Close My Eyes," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, begins with a sequence of flashbacks that reveal Natalie and Richard to be smart, attractive people who have drifted for years without a guiding focus. Natalie has always flirted recklessly with her brother, and one day a lingering kiss precipitates a ravenous mutual passion. 
Complicating matters is the fact that Natalie has finally settled down with someone. Her husband, Sinclair (Alan Rickman), an heir to a margarine fortune, is a garrulous businessman who lives in a magnificent riverside mansion and works, as he puts it, in "trends and analysis." Although Natalie and Richard fight against their attraction, it proves overwhelming. And in their clandestine rendezvous they tear at each other with the frenzy of wild animals. When Natalie finally decides to end the affair, Richard, who has given himself over completely to the relationship, begins to come apart, and an undercurrent of violence rises to the surface. 
Mr. Poliakoff, a prolific English playwright whose dramas "Shout Across the River" and "American Days" have both had New York productions, has given his story a theatrical structure whose metaphors clunk a bit too heavily for the machinery not to seem overexposed. Yet the characters in the film's central triangle are drawn with an extraordinary depth and subtlety. Natalie, though beautiful and possessed of an aristocratic willfulness, is also shown to be socially and intellectually insecure. And in the company of the voluble Sinclair, who has an opinion about everything that crosses his line of vision, she is reduced to moody silences. 
Richard is a brash, swinging bachelor with a social conscience, who as the affair begins, has taken a job with a regulatory agency that monitors the progress of a gargantuan development touted as "the new Venice." But as community-spirited as he is, he has as little success in forcing the unscrupulous developers to keep their word as he has in reining in his emotions once they have spun out of control. Richard's and Natalie's love scenes, and later their fight scenes, have a visceral energy that seems so spontaneous there are moments when one feels almost embarrassed to be caught watching. 
Best of all is Mr. Rickman's Sinclair, who in a welcome departure from his usually sinister roles, gives the dilettantish husband many layers. Beneath a supercilious facade, he is as vulnerable as Richard. Indeed, one of the film's most striking qualities is its detailed observation of the ways in which two grown men of very different temperament become emotionally unstrung. 
"Close My Eyes" is an unusually good-looking film. Witold Stok's photography gives the London suburbs a tropical lushness that is appropriate to the situation. And Michael Gibbs's throbbing semi-classical score helps keep the film's heated atmosphere well above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 
"Close My Eyes" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes explicit sex and nudity. Close My Eyes

‽Daughters of the Dust‽,‽Julie Dash's "Daughters of the Dust" is a film of spellbinding visual beauty about the Gullah people living on the Sea Islands off the South Carolina-Georgia coast at the turn of the century. More than any other group of Americans descended from West Africans, the Gullahs, through their isolation, were able to maintain African customs and rituals. Cut off from the mainland, except by boat, they had their own patois: predominantly English but with a strong West African intonation. Most of the film's dialogue is spoken in that dialect, called Geechee, with occasional subtitles in English. 
"Daughters of the Dust," which opened yesterday at Film Forum 1, focuses on the psychic and spiritual conflicts among the women of the Peazant family, a Gullah clan that makes the painful decision to migrate to the American mainland. Set on a summer day in 1902, on the eve of their departure, the film depicts an extended family picnic that is also a ritual farewell celebration attended by a photographer. 
Each of the principal characters represents a different view of a family heritage that, once the Peazants have dispersed throughout the North, may not survive. Nana Peazant (Cora Lee Day), the group's 88-year-old great-grandmother and the clan's closest link to its Yoruba roots, still practices ritual magic and grieves over the demise of that tradition. Viola Peazant (Cherly Lynn Bruce) is a devout Baptist who has rejected Nana's spiritualism but who brings to her Christianity a similar fervency. Haagar (Kaycee Moore), who married into the family, disparages its African heritage as "hoodoo" and eagerly anticipates assimilation into America's middle class. Yellow Mary (Barbara-O), who has returned for the celebration, is the family pariah, shunned by the other women for being a prostitute. 
The most volatile conflict is between Nana's granddaughter, Eula (Alva Rogers), who is pregnant, and her husband, Eli (Adisa Anderson), who believes the father of the child she is carrying is a white rapist. Through a ritual conducted by Nana, Eli eventually realizes that he is the father of the unborn daughter who serves as the film's occasional offscreen narrator. 
Because the characters and their stories are not defined in conventional film-making terms, they are not always easy to follow. The stories, instead of being related in bite-size dramatic chunks, gradually emerge out of a broad weave in which the fabric of daily life, from food preparation to ritualized remembrance, is ultimately more significant than any of the psychological conflicts that surface. 
With a running time of nearly two hours, "Daughters of the Dust" is a very languidly paced film that frequently stops in its tracks simply to contemplate the wild beauty of the Sea Island landscape. Even though the heat, insects and threat of yellow fever made the islands inhospitable to white settlement, the movie still portrays that environment, drenched in sea mist and strewn with palms, as a semi-tropical paradise and the Peazants as a blessed tribe whose independence and harmony with nature partly offsets the scars of having been slaves. 
"Daughters of the Dust," which was made in association with the public broadcasting series "American Playhouse," is the feature film debut of Ms. Dash, who emerges as a strikingly original film maker. For all its harsh allusions to slavery and hardship, the film is an extended, wildly lyrical meditation on the power of African cultural iconography and the spiritual resilience of the generations of women who have been its custodians.  Daughters of the Dust  Written and directed by Julie Dash; director of photography, Arthur Jafa; edited by Amy Carey and Joseph Burton; music by John Barnes; production designer, Kerry Marshall; produced by Ms. Dash and Mr. Jafa; released by Kino International.

‽
‽The Inner Circle‽,‽Just when the Soviet Union is coming apart, it is paradoxical that two films featuring Stalin, the personification of Soviet totalitarianism, should play in New York simultaneously. Stalin is the paranoiac center of gravity in both Andrei Konchalovsky's dark comedy "The Inner Circle," which opened today at the Loews Fine Arts, and in Ken Palmer's "Testimony," at Film Forum 1. In "The Inner Circle," the dictator, played by Aleksandr Zbruyev, is a rotund little demon with twinkling eyes. Terence Rigby's more ominous Stalin, in "Testimony," is a hulking, shadowy beast. 
"The Inner Circle" tells the true story of Ivan Sanshin (Tom Hulce), a movie projectionist for the K.G.B. Club who on his wedding night in 1939 is routed out of his apartment and whisked into the bowels of the Kremlin. Certain he is being arrested for a minor professional mishap, he instead finds himself drafted into the job of personal projectionist for Stalin. His predecessor, he is told, died of a heart attack when yelled at. 
In one of the film's whimsical juxtapositions, the first film Ivan shows the dictator is "The Great Waltz," the glossy Hollywood biography of Johann Strauss and a movie whose giddy spirits seem grotesquely incongruous given the setting. 
Veering unpredictably between comedy and pathos, "The Inner Circle" is a study of prolonged political naivete and its unhappy consequences. Long after it is clear to many in the Soviet Union that Stalin is a tyrant, Ivan remains buffoonishly idolatrous of his boss. In love with his job, he throws himself into his work with the frenzied zeal of a song-and-dance man working up new routines. 
When during an argument with his wife, Anastasiya (Lolita Davidovich), she asks whom he loves more, her or Stalin, he replies, "Stalin," as if no other answer could possibly be imagined. Even after German bombs have reduced his Moscow neighborhood to rubble, he remains stubbornly worshipful. 
Anastasiya, who is more naive than her husband, is emotionally unstable. She fixates her affections on the orphaned daughter of neighbors who were purged by the K.G.B. and, without telling her husband, secretly visits the little girl in the orphanage. Later, when Ivan and Anastasiya accompany Stalin and his entourage on a trip to the Ural Mountains, she lacks the wherewithal to resist the advances of the K.B.G. chief, Lavrenti P. Beria (Bob Hoskins), and her life goes into a tailspin. 
"The Inner Circle" takes a remarkably lighthearted view of a world in which mortal terror pervades the most everyday interpersonal transactions. Lest they be overheard by spying neighbors, Ivan and Anatasiya bundle themselves into a wardrobe to conduct a serious conversation. The scenes in which Stalin engages a quiveringly frightened Ivan in conversation are played with an undercurrent of farce. 
This air of detached gallows humor is augmented by the use of occasional snippets of narration to push the story forward and by some vaguely surreal touches, including the view from Ivan's apartment window showing cattle moving through a cityscape flecked with impossibly large drifting snowflakes. The seriocomic tone is sustained for so long that when the mood of the film suddenly turns darker and more emotional, one has to make a sudden adjustment. 
Yet the film's odd shift from wryness to pathos works to its advantage. One never feels manipulated. And Mr. Hulce, who adopts a serviceable Russian accent for the role, makes the dutiful Ivan a complex character who is alternately maddening and engaging. 
"The Inner Circle is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild sexual scenes. The Inner Circle Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky; written by Mr. Konchalovsky and Anatoly Usov; director of photography, Ennio Guarnieri; edited by Henry Richardson; music by Eduard Artemyev; production designer, Ezio Frigerio; produced by Claudio Bonivento; released by Columbia Pictures.

‽The Prince of Tides‽,‽Nothing about Barbra Streisand's previous acting or direction is preparation for her expert handling of "The Prince of Tides," which has been pared down from Pat Conroy's sprawling, hyperbolic novel to a film that is gratifyingly lean. Discretion and reserve are not the first qualities that come to mind about Ms. Streisand's work, yet they are very much in evidence this time. So is the frankly emotional style with which she is more often associated, a style perfectly attuned to this film's complex, stirring story. "The Prince of Tides" marks Ms. Streisand's triumphantly good job of locating that story's salient elements and making them come alive on the screen. 
Everything about Mr. Conroy's overripe family saga is suffused with excess, from the author's descriptions of his characters ("The words of her poems were a most private and fragrant orchard," he writes of Savannah Wingo, the narrator Tom Wingo's twin sister) to the experiences those characters share. The three Wingo children, Luke, Savannah and Tom, seem to do everything in unison, often on what are either the very best or very worst days of their lives. Feisty, brave and endlessly self-dramatizing, they have the knack of being colorful to a fault. 
Their mother, Lila, who raised them idyllically on a South Carolina sea island, was both the most soothing and the most treacherous parent in the world. The island itself was Paradise, then Paradise Lost. Their abusive father, Henry, cast a giant shadow over his children's lives. All of the Wingos' personal dramas are played out on this exhaustingly grand scale. 
"The Prince of Tides" centers on the adult Tom's efforts to overcome the effects of his painful childhood and come to terms with the various women in his life. These are Lila (Kate Nelligan), now a brittle, wealthy matron; Sallie (Blythe Danner), the wife experiencing the full brunt of Tom's unhappiness; Savannah (Melinda Dillon), now a suicidally depressed New Yorker, and Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Ms. Streisand), Savannah's psychiatrist, who enlists Tom's help in treating Savannah and winds up getting to the heart of Tom's troubles, too. 
One of the best things Ms. Streisand has done here is to get out of the way, so her portrayal of Dr. Lowenstein never upstages Nick Nolte's superlative Tom. "The Prince of Tides" must be Tom's story if it is to have any center, and so Ms. Streisand mostly confines herself to the role of a clever, attractive, authoritative figure on the sidelines. Later on, when Tom and the doctor do become romantically involved, the film takes on a few gooey overtones, what with a too-picturesque weekend in the country, a roaring fire and so on. But by and large it does a remarkable job of maintaining its intelligence and dignity. 
As envisioned by Mr. Conroy, Dr. Lowenstein's attempts to treat Tom have a coy, flirtatious ring and do a lot to undermine her professionalism.  Ms. Streisand's smarter, more composed version of this character is only one of her film's notable improvements upon the novel. The screenplay, by Mr. Conroy and Becky Johnston, consistently extracts the book's best lines of dialogue and leaves the rest behind. The book may have the feel of an overwrought, melodramatic movie, but the film itself does not. 
Long, tedious anecdotes about the Wingos' colorful exploits have been compressed into brief snippets from home movies or else simply removed.  (Happily, the pet tiger that plays a role in Mr. Conroy's most traumatic episode is just about gone.) The novel's big revelations have been given different weight here, and in the film's version they make more sense.  Ms. Streisand makes some especially skillful transitions in juxtaposing Tom's present and past for the audience, just as they are connected in the character's own mind. 
A lot of attention has gone into keeping up both stars' appearances, and their sleek good looks give the film a romantic spirit it might otherwise lack. Ms. Streisand looks quietly, unobtrusively elegant, as do the sets representing her home and office.  And Mr. Nolte comes atypically close to matinee idol status with this role.  The fact that his hair has never looked quite so blond or so glossy should not detract from the fire, urgency and flawless timing that shape his performance. Mr. Nolte is every bit as good while engaging in wrenching therapeutic sessions with Dr. Lowenstein as he is in declaring in a restaurant: "God, there's nothin' sexier than a beautiful woman orderin' food in French. Now I want you to read me the whole menu." 
"The Prince of Tides" has been particularly well cast, with several strongly appealing actresses in minor roles. Ms. Dillon has little to do but look traumatized; however, Ms. Danner and especially Ms. Nelligan add substantially to the film's vivid sense of Tom's life. Jeroen Krabbe plays the story's least plausible character, the world-famous violinist unhappily married to Dr. Lowenstein, and still manages to give the role some panache. Notably good also is Jason Gould, who plays Ms. Streisand's son and very obviously    is    her son, in both appearance and manner.  Mr. Gould makes this unhappy teen-ager a worthwhile part of the film's overall equation instead of the fifth wheel he easily could have been. 
Contributing to the lavish tone of "The Prince of Tides" are James Newton Howard's swelling score and Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography, which visually captures the long-lost glow of childhood implicit in the story. 
"The Prince of Tides" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity, sexual suggestiveness and one episode of violent sexual assault.

‽Until the End of the World‽,‽When it comes to making movies, Wim Wenders is not your average wild and crazy guy. Antic fun for its own sake is not something for which he is known. The German-born director's more recent films ("Wings of Desire," "Paris, Texas," "Hammett") have been schematic and dour, with hard surfaces encasing centers as soft as chocolate-covered cherries. 
For much of its nearly three-hour running time, "Until the End of the World" is something else, a daffy, eccentric road movie that pursues its own inscrutable lighthearted logic through 15 cities in 8 countries on 4 continents. 
"Until the End of the World" has less to do with Mr. Wenders's own early road movies, "Alice in the Cities" and "Kings of the Road," than it does with the kind of elegantly slap-dash improvisations that Jean-Luc Godard once made with (and for) the incomparable Anna Karina. Though it is set in 1999, the movie looks like a mint-condition artifact of the 1960's. 
As the film opens, a narrator informs us that an Indian nuclear satellite has swung out of orbit and threatens to crash to earth to destroy all life. The rest of the world is in a panic but, the narrator goes on, "Claire couldn't care less." 
Claire (Solveig Dommartin), who sometimes wears a black wig that emphasizes her resemblance to the young Anna Karina, is waking up in a strange place, as has been her habit of late, this time at a chicly decadent party in Venice. On the drive back to Paris, Claire becomes the willing bag lady for a pair of loutish but gentle thieves who have just robbed a bank in Nice. 
She agrees to transport the loot to Paris in exchange for a one-third cut. She then picks up Sam Farber (William Hurt), an American on the run, though from whom or what Claire doesn't know. Again she couldn't care less. She's attracted to Sam for his sad eyes and his taste in music, an audio tape of songs sung by pygmy children in Cameroon. 
Claire's patience is tried when Sam makes off with a large part of her money. She tells her lover, Gene (Sam Neill), a novelist based in Paris and a man whose patience is inexhaustible, that she's going after Sam. 
In this fashion the chase begins: Sam, followed by Claire, followed by a bounty hunter (Sam is said to be involved in industrial espionage), a private detective, the bank robbers and Gene, who wants to protect Claire and who, in passing, provides the film's narration. Money for travel arrangements never seems to be a problem. By 1999, the recession is clearly over. 
The trail leads from Paris to Lisbon, Berlin, Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo and San Francisco. It finally ends with all the characters in the Australian outback, where what amounts to another movie begins. This one involves Sam's father, Henry (Max von Sydow), a brilliant scientist, and Sam's blind mother, Edith (Jeanne Moreau). 
In his underground laboratory, Henry has been perfecting a camera that will allow the blind to see. It records the impulses of a brain when it contemplates an image, then feeds those impulses into the brain of the blind person, providing the equivalent to sight. More than that, though, it's a device for "sucking out the dreams" of almost anybody. 
It is one of Mr. Wenders's more comic conceits that Claire and the others who participate in the doctor's experiments quickly become dangerously addicted to the taped images of their dreams. They lie listlessly about the outback all day, not eating or tending to fundamental hygiene. Instead they either dream of dreams or watch those dreams on portable video monitors. 
Each addict isolates himself from the others. It's the video age as a real-life nightmare. Time and the world of commonplace responsibilities have come to a halt. Only Gene continues to believe "in the magic and the healing power of the word." 
There's much more to the movie, not all of it logical, much of it absurd and some of it (the last sequence, for example) funnier than even Mr. Wenders may know. The film's center is characteristically squashy. 
What is appealing about "Until the End of the World" is its looseness. It appears to be composed of musiclike riffs, and with the exception of Mr. von Sydow and Miss Moreau, nobody seems to take it too seriously until the name of Greenpeace is mentioned. As often happens with Mr. Wenders, it's not always possible to tell whether he knows when he's gone over the edge. 
The members of the cast are attractive and, above all, game. Shooting the film in so many far-flung locations in such a short time must have been its own nightmare. The futuristic gadgetry is kept modest in scale so the actors never have to battle the special effects. 
"Until the End of the World" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some vulgar language.

‽Father of the Bride‽,‽Vincente Minnelli's 1950 "Father of the Bride" is an affectionate reminder of the days when parties required stiff protocol, suburban life was martini-filled and gracious, a majority of one's college classmates were likely to be married and a father was truly a patriarch, valiantly meeting the fiscal and emotional needs of everyone in his household. It's an antique with a story that doesn't quite track in a world where Mother runs a business and Daddy's little girl plays basketball. 
But "Father of the Bride" has been charmingly if improbably remade, with Steve Martin as the embattled father who suffers new indignities at each stage of his daughter's wedding plans. Mr. Martin, following in the very large footsteps of Spencer Tracy, is meant to be a sturdy, house-proud businessman and the long-married, devoted father of a 22-year-old daughter. He's not believable in any of these capacities, but he can be very funny, especially when the director, Charles Shyer, gives him room to depart from Tracy's indelible performance and make the role his own. 
Mr. Martin, whose presence here probably has more to do with his success in "Parenthood" than anything else, is first seen sitting in an armchair exactly as Tracy did, rubbing his sore feet and surveying the ruins of an extravagant wedding party. The film then flashes back to the point at which George Banks (Mr. Martin) and his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), learned that their little Annie (Kimberly Williams) may be leaving the nest. 
The nest itself has moved to southern California from a starchier East Coast setting and is now conspicuously cluttered and brand-new. There's nothing about it that looks lived in, which is in keeping with the remake's artificial flavor. Still, this house becomes an interesting echo of the earlier film's exaggeratedly gracious setting. This "Father of the Bride" is filled with evidence of how the idealized vision of American family life has changed in the last 40 years, from the fact that the cost of throwing the wedding has multiplied by nearly a hundredfold to the absence of alcohol-related humor, which was a big staple of the earlier version. 
This time, when the Bankses go to meet their wealthy prospective in-laws, George doesn't drink too much and talk their ears off, as Tracy did. He experiences a sudden fit of nosiness and winds up floating in his hosts' pool, clutching their bankbook while being snarled at by their guard dogs, in a routine that is much better suited to Mr. Martin's comic talents. 
Some of the new film's other efforts to broaden the story are less successful, like the episode that has George going berserk in a grocery store and winding up in jail as a consequence of pre-wedding pressure. As for the wedding itself, it turns out to be overlong and anticlimactic, and it tries too hard to draw tears. The new film contains a lot more sentimental heart-to-heart talks than the earlier one did. 
Mr. Martin is always the comic centerpiece of "Father of the Bride," while Ms. Keaton has been given a matronly role and much less to do. Ms. Williams, who must compete with the memory of a radiant young Elizabeth Taylor in the bride's role, does a spirited job of making the character more modern. (Ms. Taylor's most memorable line, cooing to her father about her husband-to-be's occupation: "Well, I don't know, Pops, he makes something. Does it really matter what it is?") 
Kieran Culkin, playing the bride's little brother, has the same scene-stealing confidence his older brother Macaulay does. Also in the film are B. D. Wong and Martin Short as a pair of wedding consultants who are too flouncy to be entirely funny. Mr. Short, with a fussy coiffure and an indecipherable accent (he says "kek" for "cake"), strongly recalls Bronson Pinchot's hilariously bizarre art-gallery assistant in "Beverly Hills Cop." 
The screenplay, credited to Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, Nancy Meyers and Mr. Shyer, represents recycling at its best. The material has been successfully refurbished with new jokes and new attitudes, but the earlier film's most memorable moments have been preserved. One of these finds Mr. Martin struggling to squeeze into his old suit of formal clothes just as Tracy did, although in Mr. Martin's case it's a tuxedo with a ruffled shirt, circa 1975; Tracy wore a cutaway with top hat and tails. That's the difference between the first, formal "Father of the Bride" and the new one, in which condoms and seat belts and running shoes are part of the world.

‽
‽Bugsy‽,‽Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel, a true gangster Gatsby, arrived in Hollywood with a heart full of promise and a gleam in his eye. Recklessly romantic, he brought with him the first glimmer of "a Garden of Eden in the desert": a brand-new resort that would provide organized crime with a political toehold, as well as a place that would outdo even the movie capital in terms of glitter, garishness and license to indulge any whim. 
Some regard the American Dream as an expression of our best vision of ourselves. Others, like the makers of the sleek, funny, vastly entertaining "Bugsy," take a less sentimental view. This film, directed by Barry Levinson and written by James Toback, regards the man who dreamed up Las Vegas as a star-struck pragmatist, a mixture of glamour and cynicism, a visionary who saw the chance to create something very like himself only much, much bigger. "Bugsy" is a smart, seductive portrait of both the man and his monument. The debonair Ben Siegel (who greatly resented any comparison to an insect) would have loved everything about it except its name. 
Warren Beatty, who is one of the film's co-producers, has found the role of his career in this sly, evasive schemer with the manipulative instincts of a born ladies' man. When an actor as skillful as Mr. Beatty has essentially only one character in his repertory, he can indeed be glad to find that character as fully realized as Ben Siegel is here. His antecedents, in films like "Shampoo" and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," had a similar diffident charm and a similar awareness of their own failings, but Ben Siegel is much more dangerous and vital. If this self-styled "sportsman" had not existed, Mr. Beatty would have had to make him up. 
Actually, "Bugsy" does make up its hero to a certain degree. The film's rosy portrait avoids such matters as Bugsy's involvement in drug smuggling, not to mention the long, shady career enjoyed by Virginia Hill, Bugsy's lover (and by some accounts his wife), after Bugsy's messy demise. Although "Bugsy" includes deft characterizations of such mobsters as Meyer Lansky (played dryly by Ben Kingsley) and Lucky Luciano (the late Bill Graham), the film greatly understates the gangland aspects of its story. No Tommy guns here: instead, the silken "Bugsy" is filled with gold lame evening gowns, clever repartee, strawberries and Champagne. It's fitting that Ben Siegel's infatuation with the swankiest of Hollywood elegance has been incorporated into his own story. 
Directing "Bugsy" with both the requisite sweep and a welcome touch of the sardonic, Mr. Levinson begins his story at a crucial juncture in Ben Siegel's life: when this Brooklyn-born killer bade farewell to his New York origins and headed west to reinvent himself in more cinematic terms. A witty prelude establishes Ben as a flirt, a clothes horse and a tease, a man capable of presenting an expensive "shirt off my back" to someone he will murder only seconds later. In Los Angeles, where he is met at a beautifully evoked Union Station by his childhood friend George Raft (Joe Mantegna), these attributes quickly take on an aspect of the dramatic, especially when coupled with Ben's natural flair. "Gangster or Star?" a newspaper headline asks about this new arrival, early in his stay. 
Definitely a star, at least as far as "Bugsy" is concerned. The film devises a great many intoxicatingly grand gestures for its hero, including the way he first glimpses Virginia Hill across a crowded Raft movie set and simply falls into step beside her.  "May I?" he asks, seeing Virginia with an unlit cigarette. "If you want a simple yes or no you're going to have to finish the question," she replies.  The encounter instantly establishes Virginia as a match for this tough guy, and ends quite magically as the two stand atop a little hill, by a fake rustic bus stop on the movie set, extravagantly overdressed and enjoying each another's talent for backtalk. 
In this regard, Mr. Toback's screenplay is one of the film's happiest surprises. The overheated style of his own films (among them "Fingers" and "Exposed") is apparent in the dialogue, and in such episodes as Bugsy's violently humiliating another man, then feeling ravenously hungry afterward (while Virginia finds herself sexually stimulated by Bugsy's mean streak). But Mr. Levinson's direction is so adroit and wry that such moments lose their potential for excess. Thus muted, the bravado of Mr. Toback's language becomes crisply effective, as when the widely experienced Virginia tells Ben that she's been nothing but trouble for all of the many men she knew before him. "Good," Ben answers. "That's what they get for trying to steal my girl." 
As Virginia, Annette Bening provides "Bugsy" will all the heat and chemistry that Mr. Beatty's "Dick Tracy" lacked, sauntering through her role with a sexy abandon that greatly enhances the film's allure.  Only later, when Virginia becomes a pivotal figure in Ben's plans to construct a hotel (named the Flamingo, in honor of the long-legged Virginia), does Ms. Bening seem less hard-boiled, complex or changeable than the woman she plays. 
"Bugsy" pales a bit in these later sections as a consequence of its having come on like gangbusters in its opening hour. Everything the audience needs to know about Ben and Virginia is established early, and Ben himself is not fundamentally changed by the events of the story. This is limiting, but it would be more of a problem if the film's sumptuous look and Mr. Beatty's performance were not so captivating on their own. 
Also in "Bugsy" are Harvey Keitel, outstandingly blunt and funny as the gangster Mickey Cohen ("You would-be smoothie!" he shouts at Bugsy); the director Richard Sarafian as one of Ben's early henchmen; Bebe Neuwirth as the Countess Dorothy di Frasso, who Ben grandly hoped would introduce him to Benito Mussolini so Ben could personally shorten World War II, and Elliott Gould as the sad-sack childhood friend whom Ben eventually executes for business reasons. Typically, the film turns this into a solitary lethal act of Bugsy's when it was more likely the work of a three-man team. 
Allen Daviau's camera work and Albert Wolsky's costumes help to forge the film's high style, as does Ennio Morricone's score. But much of its elan comes from Mr. Levinson's obvious affection for the time and place that are his film's backdrop, and from the flair with which he stages even minor episodes, like the montage showing how Ben sells 900 percent of his shares in the Flamingo in order to finance his plan. Another memorable sequence shows Ben and Virginia slinking gracefully back and forth past a movie screen, changing from full figures to silhouettes as they stalk each another. 
Only occasionally, in a sequence that shows Ben racing from gangsters to the telephone to his unhappy family on his daughter's birthday, and wearing a chef's headgear all the while, does the film's style appear overly antic. Most of the time, its spirit is captured by the strains of "Accentuate the Positive" heard tootling in the background, and by Meyer Lansky's last words on Bugsy Siegel and Las Vegas: "He isn't even interested in money. He's interested in the idea." 
"Bugsy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual suggestiveness, violence and strong language.

‽
‽The Last Boy Scout‽,‽The best thing about Tony Scott's "Last Boy Scout" is the title, which refers to Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis), a once-exemplary Secret Service agent who wore black suits, white shirts and narrow ties, who shaved each morning and who, in his finest moment, saved the life of a United States President. 
Today Joe is history. He's a burned-out case. He is a shabby Los Angeles private eye who sleeps off his hangovers in his beat-up car. In addition to nicotine, he is hopelessly addicted to one-liners. When Mr. Big, who is about to sic his goons on Joe, says that he would like, just once, to hear Joe scream, the response is a fast, "Play some rap music." 
They don't make men like Joe anymore, but they do make screenplays like Shane Black's for "The Last Boy Scout." These would include "Lethal Weapon," for which Mr. Black wrote the screenplay, and "Lethal Weapon II," for which he wrote the first draft. 
"The Last Boy Scout" is supposed to be a homage to the tough-guy detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler; yet it plays more like a retread of the "Lethal Weapon" movies. The only things changed are the actors, the names of the characters and their professions. 
Mr. Willis plays what is, in effect, the Mel Gibson role, though not quite as entertainingly maniacal. Damon Wayans takes over for Danny Glover of "Lethal Weapon" in a role that has been somewhat refurbished but remains essentially a voice of reason. He is Jimmy Dix, a former pro football star who, like Joe, is on the skids. 
Joe's downward spiral began when a United States Senator had him fired from the service. Jimmy turned to cocaine when his wife, eight months' pregnant, was killed by a van that jumped the curb. 
In Mr. Black's macho oeuvre, women either don't live long or do live badly. Joe has a wife, Sarah (Chelsea Field), but she cheats on him. He also has a 13-year-old daughter, Darian (Danielle Harris), who wears too much makeup and talks dirty. No matter that the movie acknowledges that Joe is to blame for his domestic problems. His true helpmate is Jimmy Dix. 
"The Last Boy Scout" is about the ruthless attempt of the owner of a pro football team, called the Los Angeles Stallions, to secure senatorial backing for a bill to legalize gambling on sports. It's a story that, in other hands, might have made a good, tough, old-fashioned private-eye thriller. 
Instead, Mr. Scott and Mr. Black have concocted another exercise in mechanical sleaze, in which narrative coherence is sacrificed on behalf of pyrotechnical special effects, mostly involving transport. When automobiles are not crashing, going over embankments or being blown up (the film's favorite mode of distressing a car), someone falls atop the rotors of a helicopter in mid-air. The body count is high. 
Mr. Willis and Mr. Wayans have each demonstrated a knack for irreverent comedy in other vehicles -- Mr. Willis in "Moonlighting" on television and in the "Die Hard" movies, Mr. Wayans on television as a regular member of the cast of "In Living Color." Yet they don't play very well together. 
Joe and Jimmy meet cute and fight, then join forces to make Los Angeles safe for pro football. Their bonhomie seems forced, like the snappiness of the dialogue. 
Mr. Scott ("Top Gun," "Days of Thunder") directs the film as if he were trying to win a prize for demolishing a building in record time. The opening is good: stylish video images of a night football game played in a torrential rain, climaxed by the only scene in the film that has legitimate shock. After that, the brutality and the pace don't slacken, but interest does. 
The best thing in the film is Halle Berry ("Jungle Fever," "Strictly Business"), an actress who is going places. She appears briefly as cocktail waitress and stripper. 
The news is not all bad for Mr. Willis. "The Last Boy Scout" is better than "Hudson Hawk."

‽
‽Hook‽,‽Now we know: if Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky had been less power-driven and more in touch with the child within, Wall Street would have been spared a great scandal and each man a prison term. 
That is the balmy subtext of "Hook," Steven Spielberg's gargantuan, very long screen update on James M. Barrie's 1904 play, "Peter Pan," and the subsequent Barrie stories about the little boy who refused to grow up. The film is a Wall Street-size financial gamble in itself. 
"Hook" cost a mint, and it shows.  To be profitable, it must be all things to as many people as possible, including kids who can identify with a 40-year-old man in a midlife crisis, and 40-year-old men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses. 
The film is too much; yet the charm of the Barrie original has not been entirely lost. 
"Hook" has a hugely funny bravura performance by Dustin Hoffman as the vain, vile and none-too-effective Captain Hook. Wearing a large black wig in the style of England's unfortunate Charles I, Mr. Hoffman's Hook preens, walks with a dainty step, loses his temper easily and tries very hard to be bad. 
Equally comic is Bob Hoskins who plays Smee, Hook's smarmy aide-de-camp and, often, his brains. This cockney Smee belongs to the great theatrical tradition of wily menservants who, like Moliere's Scapin, are their masters' masters. 
As Hook is racking his brains to come up with a plan to destroy Peter Pan, Smee exclaims, "I think I'm having an apostrophe!" Says Hook, "I think you mean epiphany." The plan is, in fact, a clever one. 
Smee gets the words wrong and Hook is short on invention. Neither character has been tampered with to conform to late-20th-century sensibilities. 
The other casting is also good. As the middle-aged Peter Pan, Robin Williams doesn't look entirely comfortable when he must wear the green shorts better suited to Mary Martin, but he plays the role as legitimately as possible. Julia Roberts (Tinkerbell) goes through most of the film appearing to be about seven inches tall. Even at that size, she's a sweet, light, laughing presence. 
Yet "Hook" is overwhelmed by a screenplay heavy with complicated exposition, by what are, in effect, big busy nonsinging, nondancing production numbers and some contemporary cant about rearing children and the high price paid for success. The acute difficulty of having it all may be of greater urgency to Mr. Spielberg than to most of the people who will see the movie. 
"Hook" is less a sequel to "Peter Pan" than a variation on it. Its conceit is that, some years after the adventures described in "Peter Pan," Peter returned from Never-Never Land to London to see his adored Wendy and fell in love with Moira, the aging Wendy's granddaughter. To be able to consummate his love, he agreed to grow up. 
When "Hook" begins, Peter, now called Peter Banning, is a frenetic, hard-driving mergers-and-acquisitions wizard living in Southern California with Moira and their two children. In his climb to the top, he has lost touch with his true self. He's so absorbed by business that he misses his 11-year-old son's most important baseball game. 
Peter has completely forgotten his earlier incarnation, which is probably just as well for his career. Not many high rollers would entrust the fate of an unfriendly corporate takeover to a fellow who has a pal named Tinkerbell and as a mortal enemy a sword-buckled pirate with a hook for a hand. 
When the Banning family makes a trip to London to see the 90-year-old Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith), Peter's children are kidnapped by the vengeful Hook and taken off to Never-Never Land. There is nothing to do but go in pursuit, at which point (somewhat late) the movie really begins. 
What follows is an elaborate, thoroughly Americanized version of the Barrie play, reworked so that more time is devoted to teaching Peter how to dream and fly again than to his combat with Hook. Barrie's Lost Boys, once Peter Pan's charges, now inhabit a forest paradise equipped with basketball hoops and ramps for skateboards. 
The kids appear to be mostly refugees from today's urban society. They have the style of children of the television age. They indulge in cheerless food fights and their language is sitcom wise, prematurely hip. They seem to be less permanently lost than on a two-week vacation at summer camp. 
Their re-education of Peter may amuse very young patrons, but they aren't an especially funny or engaging crew. The movie picks up when Peter at long last takes to the air. Mr. Williams flies well. Yet he has a problem that no legitimate theater Peter Pan faces. 
When an actor onstage goes swooping aloft, even though carried by wires never entirely invisible, the audience is as much mesmerized by the mechanics of the stunt (and the thought of what might happen, heaven forbid) as by the flying's import to the play. 
Because anything can be done in a movie, the flying has less emotional impact. Special effects today are commonplace. 
The sequences set in the pirate's cove and aboard the pirate ship, the Jolly Roger (which never leaves the dock), are somewhat more entertaining, but the movie's obviously expensive scale inhibits the fun instead of enhancing it. 
The pirates' cove is a major movie set. As seen in long shots, it looks like something from the imagination of an uncharacteristically winsome Hieronymus Bosch. The ambers, reds, browns and grays are pretty, and the eye is dazzled by the sight of so many extras, each going about a different task. It's only with difficulty that Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Williams dominate so much scenery. It's an exhausting labor. 
In "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Empire of the Sun," Mr. Spielberg demonstrated that he is one of America's most able directors when it comes to handling young actors.  It's a surprise then that, with one exception, the children in "Hook" are so perfunctorily cast and directed. 
Only Charlie Korsmo, the boy who played Kid in "Dick Tracy," is right.  His material is no better than that given the other children, but he has wit and emotional weight as the son whom Peter has neglected. He even holds his own with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Hoskins, in particular, in a baseball game that Hook has arranged to win the boy's affection. 
Mr. Korsmo is a real actor. So, too, are Miss Smith and Caroline Goodall, who plays Moira, though their roles are subsidiary to the decor and the other stars. 
Jim V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo wrote the screenplay from a screen story by Mr. Hart and Nick Castle. The biggest laugh they provide is a lawyer joke. It's probably not the writers' fault that one keeps hearing what sound like song cues, if only because the 1954 "Peter Pan" musical adaptation remains so fresh. 
Perhaps one day Mr. Hoffman will get a chance to sing that show's classic "Captain Hook's Waltz," music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. In the meantime he does very well just acting the role with brilliance, a cappella. 
"Hook," which has been rated PG (Parental guidance suggested), has some mildly scary moments and impolite language. Hook Directed by Steven Spielberg; screenplay by Jim V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo, story by Mr. Hart and Nick Castle; director of photography, Dean Cundey; film editor, Michael Kahn; music by John Williams; production design, Norman Garwood; produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Gerald R.

‽
‽The Double Life of Veronique‽,‽If "The Double Life of Veronique" seems ambiguous now, think about what the director wanted it to be. Krzysztof Kieslowski's original idea was to create several slightly different versions of the film, to play in different theaters. If a viewer saw "Veronique" twice at different places, the story might change like a favorite bedtime story in which a phrase is altered or a scene added or dropped with each telling. There would be no "right" way to see the film. 
The idea was too impractical and expensive to be more than a thought, but the notion suggests the best way to approach the enigmatic story of a Polish woman named Veronika and a French woman named Veronique (both played by Irene Jacob). The two young women look identical, were born at the same time, never meet, yet share some not-quite-conscious affinity. They are and are not the same. Don't even attempt to resolve that paradox, and "The Double Life of Veronique" will work on its own poetic terms. Try to piece the film together like a jigsaw puzzle, try to make it yield some neat message about identity, and nothing will result except frustration. 
"Veronique" has recently started its commerical run after being shown at the Cannes and New York film festivals. If the film is frustrating to many viewers, it is partly because Mr. Kieslowski plays with the jigsaw-puzzle approach, creating too many parallels and coincidences, photographing too many mirrors and reflections in windows. The images are richly beautiful, but the director sometimes seems to be scattering clues and red herrings across two countries and two lives. 
The first section of the film, set in Poland, follows Veronika as she goes to visit her aunt in Cracow, wins a music contest and collapses on stage while singing. Only after her collapse does the film move on, permanently, to Veronique in Paris. She is making love, apparently content. Suddenly she feels sad, "as if I were grieving," she says. She has no conscious idea that Veronika exists, much less that something has happened to her. Still, as if she had been warned, Veronique gives up her own plans for a professional career in music and becomes a teacher. 
But the film's impact does not rely on such clues linking the women; it rests on the poetic images that defy translation and that link them even more firmly than the actual clues. Veronique receives a piece of string in the mail, a mysterious gift from an admirer. It is a sign identifying the man who sent it, a puppeteer and author who has written a children's book about a shoelace. 
To viewers, it is a much less literal sign, one that brings to mind the image of Veronika singing and twisting the tie-string of her music folder around her finger until the string acccidentally snaps off. 
Early in the film, Veronika holds up a small, clear plastic ball with brightly colored stars inside. It is a talisman that she carries in her purse, and as she rides the train to Cracow it reflects the image of a church and the passing landscape, upside down. Veronique dreams of Veronika's landscapes, and carries an identical little ball in her purse. 
Veronique even teaches her class the same choral music that Veronika sings. The piece was composed 200 years ago but discovered only recently, she tells the class. This is another of Mr. Kieslowski's tricks. The music was created by Zbigniew Preisner, who has worked on several other Kieslowski films. 
The composition, brand new, only seems to carry the weight of history, just as the film only seems to carry specific clues about the themes of identity. The string does not have any allegorical meaning; neither does the star-filled plastic ball. "Veronique" is poetic in the truest sense, relying on images that can't be turned into prosaic statements without losing something of their essence. The film suggests mysterious connections of personality and emotion, but it was never meant to yield any neat, summary idea about the two women's lives. 
Viewers are accustomed to much more certainty on screen, though. In fact, the version of "Veronique" now playing has a slightly different ending from the one released in France. There, Veronique goes to visit her father, stops some distance from the house, and puts her hand on a tree -- a tentative, inexplicable image. But after that version was shown at the New York Film Festival this year, Mr. Kieslowski realized that the ambiguity made American audiences uncomfortable. So he added a scene that shows Veronique walking to the house, embracing her father, finally at home with herself and the mystery of her double existence. It is a more soothing conclusion, but it won't alter anyone's opinion of the film. 
Neither would any of the other endings Mr. Kieslowski proposed when he was thinking about the many versions of "Veronique." One would have ended with the puppeteer inventing a story about identical women, a scene that now comes very near the end of the film. Another version would have sent Veronique to Cracow, where she would have caught the eye of a singer who looks almost, but not exactly, like herself and Veronika. These many lives of Veronique would have frustrated some expectations but opened endless poetic possibilities. 
‽
‽Young Soul Rebels‽,‽There are those who remember the summer of 1977, when punk-rock rudely exploded onto the London pop scene, as a shining moment when rock-and-roll briefly became a potent political wedge in British society. Those days when Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols proclaimed "Anarchy in the U.K." are fondly remembered in "Young Soul Rebels," a film by the British black independent film maker Isaac Julien. The movie's injections of racial and sexual politics suggest a crude, low-budget hybrid of "My Beautiful Laundrette" and "Pump Up the Volume." 
Two years ago, Mr. Julien's cinematic meditation on the poet Langston Hughes, "Looking for Langston," was shown at the New York Film Festival and caused a minor furor because of its insistence on Hughes's homosexuality. Mr. Julien's examination of the punk-rock era brings a similar racial and sexual perspective to its portrait of two friends who operate a pirate radio station out of an East End garage. 
An odd couple who have known each other since childhood, Chris (Valentine Nonyela) is mulatto, slightly effeminate and heterosexual, while Caz (Mo Sesay) is black, macho and gay. Each night on their station, Soul Patrol, they broadcast the latest records by Parliament and Funkadelic and other late-1970's funk luminaries. The film's perspective on the halycon days of punk culture is black-oriented. Chris and Caz belong to an exuberant corps of brightly attired soul brothers and sisters who share the streets with spiky-haired punks, disco-hopping gay men and ominously glowering skinheads. The film's social nexus is an interracial, omnisexual dance club called the Crypt. 
One of the many things that the movie, which opens today at the Village East Cinema, also tries to be is a murder mystery. One night while cruising a park, T. J. (Shyro Chung), a close friend of Chris and Caz, is slashed to death. In a plot twist clumsily reminiscent of "Blow-Up," Chris visits the scene of the crime and finds the boom box T. J. was carrying when he was killed, which contains a tape of the killer's voice. It is not long before Chris is arrested for the crime and viciously interrogated by the police. 
"Young Soul Rebels" is at its worst when it is trying to be a whodunit. Early in the movie, it is quite clear who the murderer is. And the moments when the film tries to build suspense are clankingly overdone. At its best, the movie lays bare the schisms in London society in scenes of the local street life, where tensions are often on the verge of erupting into violence. 
The film is also at its most engaging in its portrayal of Chris and Caz as they simultaneously enter new relationships. Chris, who aspires to be a professional disk jockey, becomes involved with a sleek production assistant (Sophie Okonedo) at a commercial radio station. Caz takes up with Billibud (Jason Durr), a white punk who is helping to organize a demonstration against the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebration. The scenes of meeting and courtship capture the awkwardness and the excitement of youthful infatuation with a freshness and zest that avoids the high-gloss cliches of young love, Hollywood-style.

‽At Play in the Fields of the Lord‽,‽"At Play in the Fields of the Lord," Hector Babenco's adaptation of the Peter Matthiessen novel, is a big, melancholy screen adventure, vividly realized in the jungles of Brazil, about people out of touch with one another and at dangerous odds with a primeval world they understand not at all. 
With fidelity to the book, and to the look, sound, heat and wet of the exotic locale, Mr. Babenco evokes the arrogant confusion of a small group of mismatched North Americans, caught in a brutal landscape that overwhelms them even as it's disappearing. Though the movie sometimes has trouble expressing what's on its mind, it is a rare movie in that it has something on its mind to express. 
The principal characters include a pair of mangy bush pilots, Moon (Tom Berenger) and Wolf (Tom Waits), who, low on money and gas, are stranded at a godforsaken jungle outpost, their passports and single-engine plane impounded. Wolf is a profane, hard-drinking urban lout.  Moon is a moody loner, who is also half American Indian. 
Also in the village, staying at the only hotel, are two youngish missionary couples, Leslie and Andy Huben (John Lithgow and Daryl Hannah) and Martin and Hazel Quarrier (Aidan Quinn and Kathy Bates) who, with their small son, have just arrived from the States. 
The Hubens and the Quarriers share an earnest, psalm-singing, fundamentalist Christian faith. They are out to save the savages (Hazel Quarrier's term) from their Stone Age ways and from the Roman Catholic priests who, if they could, would have saved the savages first. 
The screenplay, adapted by Jean-Claude Carriere and Mr. Babenco, tells several stories simultaneously.  It's about Moon's reverse conversion when he leaves civilization's squalid outpost to join the Niarunas, an especially primitive Indian tribe he associates with his own North American people. 
It's also about the missionaries' attempt to set up a jungle church to convert the Niaruna, about the collapse of the courage of one of the missionaries, the loss of faith of another and the madness of a third. "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" doesn't play smoothly, but it often plays well. 
The film's most interesting character, acted by Mr. Quinn with a secretive kind of intelligence, is Martin Quarrier. Trapped in a marriage to a woman of small, unstable mind, Martin would honor both his marriage and his faith and becomes, almost in spite of himself, heroic. 
Unlike the Quarriers' marriage, the Hubens' appears to be a happy one. It seems to be a true union of body, mind and spirit, but then it become apparent that Leslie Huben is the sort of man who is more skillful at public relations and moral compromises than at his work in the field.  Except for the particular crisis that these missionaries must face, the Hubens' marriage would probably have been a long and satisfying one. 
Though the enlightened Martin Quarrier is the center of the film, the character on whom the film rests is Moon, whose search for identity is not dramatized in any convincing way. It isn't just that the movie cannot enter Moon's thoughts. The novel has the same problem, even though Mr. Matthiessen devotes many pages to Moon's drug-induced hallucinations before he makes his big leap to freedom. 
"At Play in the Fields of the Lord" looks sensationally good. There is no faking these jungle locations, whether seen from the air, as Moon's fragile plane flies wanly into a time long past, or on the ground, where the flora can be as malignant as the fauna. A number of individual scenes stand out, including an early bar encounter of the drunken Moon with the naive Martin Quarrier and an amused, patient Catholic priest. 
Says Moon, "If the Lord made Indians the way they are, who are you to make them different?" That is the film's worthy but not exactly novel point. 
The life at the jungle church settlement is richly realized. Yet an important scene, in which the beautiful Andy Huben goes skinny-dipping, seems wildly out of place, if only because Miss Hannah's body looks too magnificent to be entirely true in these circumstances. The scene is essential to everything that happens afterward and is taken directly from the book, but fidelity sometimes backfires. 
Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written.  Miss Bates is splendid as a big, slow, furious and frightened woman, someone who should never have ventured south of Orlando, Fla. Mr. Berenger maintains his self-respect in sequences that often suggest the National Geographic come to life. 
Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism. 
Whatever the reason, "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" leaves one a bit bemused, vaguely worrying about the fate of the rain forests and the ozone layer as the endangered Indians. To this extent, the movie can be said to engage the intellect somewhat more than the emotions. 
"At Play in the Fields of the Lord," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has nudity, violence and vulgar language.

‽
‽Kafka‽,‽Steven Soderbergh's "Kafka" is a very bad well-directed movie. 
The film, the director's first since making his splashy debut with "Sex, Lies and Videotape," opens a one-week engagement today at the Cinema 2 to qualify for the Academy Awards. 
"Kafka" is spectacularly split.  Though it is a dark, atmospheric pastiche suggested by, but not exactly based on, the life and writings of Franz Kafka, it has the blinding optimism of a sophomore who expects his five-page outline for a novel to win a National Book Award. 
At the film's dualist heart is Lem Dobbs's original screenplay. Mr. Dobbs seems to be an enthusiastic if skeptical student of, among other things, "The Trial," "Metamorphosis" and "The Castle," at least he was when the screenplay was written 10 years ago. In the belief that no Kafka novel or short story could easily be transferred to the screen, Mr. Dobbs set out to write his own Kafka-ish work, which he describes as "a fast-paced combination of thrills and comedy." 
The result is the gloomy "Kafka," set in Prague in 1919, about a man named Kafka (Jeremy Irons), a distant relative of such Franz Kafka protagonists as Gregor Samsa, Joseph K. and just plain K. The fictional Kafka slaves away at a dreary job in an insurance claims office by day and, by night, writes novels and stories. 
"What are you working on now?" asks a sculptor of tombstones. "Oh," says Kafka, pleased that anyone should be interested, "a story about a man who wakes up to find himself transformed into a giant insect." 
When a friend disappears, Kafka sets out to search for him, only to become a victim himself. He is pursued by "them," the mostly nameless others, authority figures who represent the office in which he works, the police and even the unseen, unknown figures in the great castle that guards the city below. 
His investigations lead him to the friend's mistress (Theresa Russell) who, in turn, introduces Kafka to a band of bomb-planting anarchists.  Somehow Kafka comes into possession of his own bomb. When the friend's body turns up in the river, the police call it a suicide, which Kafka thinks unlikely. 
The answers to these questions, Kafka knows, are in the castle. He vows to enter it, though no one has ever gone there and come out alive.  It's at this point that Kafka meets Indiana Jones, if not in fact or style, at least in spirit. 
By adding coherence and what might be called rational evil to the Kafka-ish situation, Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Soderbergh have somehow eliminated all sense of menace from the movie. One fools around with Franz Kafka's lucid prose and dread visions at one's own peril. 
"Kafka" is opaque without ever being mysterious, frightening or suggestive of anything but movie making. Its chases through dark narrow streets don't create suspense, since nothing is at stake. Kafka is no less a cipher than those representatives of the forces that would destroy him. 
It's not giving anything away to report that the movie does close on a Kafka-ish note, but it comes too late to have meaning. The same is true of the single cough that Mr. Irons suddenly coughs toward the end of the movie, a dutiful reminder of how the real Franz K. died in 1924. 
The screenplay is a mess, but Mr. Soderbergh's handling of it is not at all bad. He demonstrates the kind of unflappable facility with which such old-time studio directors as Michael Curtiz and George Marshall once approached every second-rate assignment. 
Though "Kafka" bears no resemblance to "Sex, Lies and Videotape," which was written by Mr. Soderbergh and is a contemporary comedy of real wit, the director treats the material as if it were the real thing, that is, something by Franz K. The movie, which was shot largely in Prague, looks good. 
Walt Lloyd's black-and-white cinematography recalls not only the German Expressionist cinema but also the work of Orson Welles, in particular Welles's 1963 adaptation of "The Trial," filmed in Paris's abandoned Gare d'Orsay. Whether consciously or not, Gavin Bocquet, the production designer, evokes that Belle Epoque railroad station in his set for the anarchists' headquarters. 
Alec Guinness, Ian Holm, Ms. Russell, Joel Grey, Armin Mueller-Stahl and the other members of the supporting cast underplay their roles with notable self-effacement. Carrying the film from start to finish is Mr. Irons, who is far darker, more intense and more latently tubercular than the screenplay ever indicates. 
"Kafka," which is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), would probably put a child to sleep long before a possibly scary sequence at the climax, one in which people are seen being fatally annoyed in a laboratory worthy of the mad old Dr. Frankenstein.

‽
‽My Girl‽,‽Here are two notable facts about Macaulay Culkin, currently America's youngest movie star. One: his voice is changing, since he's now 11 years old. And two: he plays nothing more than a supporting role in "My Girl," even though the surprise success of "Home Alone" (which was released before this film began shooting) owed so much to his natural comic talent and his flair for the double-take shriek. Expecting this funny, unaffected young actor to spend most of his time on the sidelines, as the makers of "My Girl" do, is a little like trying to defy gravity -- and just about as smart. 
Mr. Culkin is not even the "my" in "My Girl," since the film is chiefly about the girl herself. She is Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky), and the film's case of the cutes extends well beyond that name. Vada's father, Harry (Dan Aykroyd), is a playful mortician who kids around in the embalming room and is accused of "cremating" the food at the backyard barbecue. Harry's new assistant is Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), a zany cosmetologist who assures her employer: "I promise I'll take good care of these people. They deserve it. They're dead. All they've got left is their looks." Too much of the film's wit is in this same funny-as-a-corpse vein. 
There are also gags about the senility of Vada's grandmother (Ann Nelson) and the little girl's fanciful hypochondria, which has her deciding at one point that she has prostate cancer. Only slightly less ghoulish is the budding romance between Harry, who has been a widower since Vada's mother died in childbirth, and the unnaturally pert Shelly, who is supposed to be just thrilled to be taken on a date to a bingo game. Mr. Aykroyd, looking rotund and rather hangdog, makes a very unlikely romantic lead. Ms. Curtis tries gamely but unconvincingly to appear smitten. 
Also in the film are Griffin Dunne as the creative-writing teacher on whom Vada has a crush and Richard Masur as Harry's livelier, funnier brother. And then there's Mr. Culkin as Thomas J. Sennett, Vada's best friend. Thomas J., as he is called, is almost always second banana to the pretty, tomboyish Vada until the fateful day when he does something so foolhardy that it gets him killed. The fact that Mr. Culkin dies in this film has been widely publicized, but the circumstances are so farfetched and awful that they defy belief. 
It's not hard for the maudlin "My Girl" to make its audience weepy at the sight of America's favorite kid in an open coffin. But it    is    difficult for this film to mix the sugary unreality of a television show with such a clumsy and manipulative morbid streak. The screenplay, by Laurice Elehwany, is a collection of loose ends bound together only by intimations of mortality and family crisis, not to mention a vague notion of Vada's coming of age. All of these matters, incidentally, are handled with infinitely more grace by another current family drama with a young tomboy as its heroine, "The Man in the Moon." 
As directed by Howard Zieff, "My Girl" has a bizarrely light tone and an awkward pace, in part because it's hard for the director to keep track of the story's many half-developed subplots. The film's few laughs arise from Ms. Curtis's eagerness to put blue eye shadow on every corpse (the year is 1972, although not much about the costumes or backgrounds supports that) and Ms. Chlumsky's exaggerated bluntness. Ms. Chlumsky is a poised, lovely young actress whose competence is in a different league from Mr. Culkin's gifts as a remarkably funny Everykid. Whenever they appear together, she gets the close-ups but he steals the scene. 
"My Girl" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes      adult sexual references, talk about puberty and numerous references to death.

‽
‽For the Boys‽,‽The hardest thing Bette Midler has to do in "For the Boys," the big, sweeping multi-hanky musical in which she plays a U.S.O. entertainer named Dixie Leonard, is to pretend to be shy. When in 1942 Dixie is first approached to tour with an established star named Eddie Sparks (James Caan), she is all butterflies. Can she perform before a large crowd? Will she get over her jitters? The film may dwell on these questions, but its audience knows full well that Dixie Leonard, being a lot like Ms. Midler, can bring down the house even if she's playing an open-air arena in a war zone. 
That's the point, of course. "For the Boys," which is opening today at the Ziegfeld, is a custom-tailored showcase for Ms. Midler's talents, and it offers her a role in which screen character and offstage persona are powerfully intertwined. In the 1940's, a period toward which Ms. Midler has always shown an affinity, an actress with a personality this strong would always have fused her own larger-than-life image with that of whomever she was playing. Today that happens less often, but Ms. Midler has wisely taken the bull by the horns. Acting as one of her own producers, she has seen to it that "For the Boys" offers her an appealing, frank, always pivotal leading role, one that no one else could have played. 
"For the Boys," directed by Mark Rydell, is at its best when concentrating on Dixie, which it does most of the time. First seen in elaborate makeup as a tough-talking, embittered old broad, she feigns infirmity but still manages to convey great reserves of grandmotherly zip. This makes a strong contrast with the film's next sequence, in which the elderly Dixie remembers her first encounter with Eddie Sparks. Looking rosy, young and vital, Ms. Midler is an instant crowd-pleaser. And when she takes the stage with Eddie and walks off with the show, she takes command of the movie as well. 
"For the Boys" follows Eddie and Dixie through 50 years of what is essentially a rocky friendship and stormy business relationship, but not much more. This is surprising in view of the film's extravagantly romantic style and its portentous sense that some crucial development between Dixie and Eddie may be in the offing.  In fact, the real emphasis is on Dixie as the mother of Danny, who is a small boy in the 1940's scenes and a soldier by the time the film gets to Vietnam. In a way, "For the Boys" makes a clever choice in presenting Ms. Midler more as a noble, long-suffering mother figure with a flair for wisecracks than as a garden-variety romantic heroine. 
But even allowing for its lack of romantic chemistry (despite a fleeting one-night encounter that has Dixie back to her same old scathing remarks in the morning), the film has trouble with its central relationship, in part because James Caan never makes Eddie the magnetic figure he is supposed to be. Never credible as a famous song-and-dance man (although he displays more than enough temper and vanity for a star's role) and looking more like a world-weary carnival barker, Mr. Caan's Eddie is too easily upstaged by his partner and not enough of a foil. The screenplay, by Marshall Brickman, Neal Jimenez and Lindy Laub, never seems entirely certain of what it wants to see happening between them. 
Dixie works better in big, sometimes shamelessly sentimental tableaux than she does in intimate settings anyhow. This film's most touching moments generally occur either on Christmas or when Dixie and Eddie bring their act to war-torn places, first to North Africa, where Dixie is tearfully reunited with her husband and serenades him with "Come Rain or Come Shine" before a large, appreciative military crowd. 
Manipulative as this is, it presents Ms. Midler with some remarkable opportunities for heartstring-pulling, which she does especially well during the film's wrenching Vietnam chapter. Many other films have covered this territory, and done it better. But when Ms. Midler performs an eerily delicate, anthemlike rendition of "In My Life" to a group of soldiers who have come face-to-face with their own mortality, she adds something new. It's a moment that lingers long after the film is over. 
Ms. Midler's performance, even in a role as patently flattering and theatrical as this one, has an edge of candor that keeps her seeming very real. "For the Boys" is also deft in recapitulating various cultural landmarks of its time frame, from the ways in which pinups have changed through different wars to the progress of network television and its conventions. The film's brief, sardonic looks at television are often clever, and it even attempts a scene in which Dixie champions a blacklisted associate (who has been fired while wearing a Santa Claus suit at Christmas). "Me! Who always thought Karl was the sixth Marx brother, after Zeppo!" she complains after being punished by her network for this outburst. 
Also in "For the Boys" are George Segal as the uncle who helps give Dixie her start, Arye Gross as the nice young man who coaxes her onto television one last time, Dori Brenner as an early colleague and Christopher Rydell as the grown-up Danny and such ringers as Melissa Manchester and Bud Yorkin in small roles. The cast is big and helpful, but the star is always at center stage. 
"For the Boys" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual innuendoes and off-color language.

‽
‽Dingo‽,‽One day in the remote Australian village of Poona Flat, strange music drops out of the sky, and a little boy named John Anderson has an epiphany. It is 1969. A cargo plane carrying members of a jazz ensemble has been diverted to the outback for an unscheduled layover. As the villagers stare, dumbfounded, seven musicians file onto the runway and give an impromptu jazz concert. John is riveted by the sounds coming from the trumpet of the group's lead player, Billy Cross (Miles Davis). "You seemed tuned into it," Billy tells the star-struck boy afterward. "If you ever come to Paris, look me up." 
So begins Rolf de Heers's film "Dingo," a wildly romantic story about a jazz musician in pursuit of his muse. The 1991 film, which opens a two-week engagement today at Cinema Village, jumps forward two decades. John (Colin Friels), now married and the father of two girls, ekes out a living trapping the Australian wild dogs known as dingos. A largely self-taught trumpeter who has learned the instrument by studying Billy Cross records, he plays on weekends with a local "bush band," whose skiffle-style rock-and-roll has nothing to do with jazz. Alone in the desert, he aims his instrument at the sky and produces lonely warbling doglike cries that echo the sounds of his idol's records, and earn him the nickname Dingo. 
John, who corresponds with Billy's agent, has secretly saved $3,000 for a trip to Paris to reunite with his boyhood idol. In the last third of the movie, when he makes the trip, the film changes from a gritty portrait of a talented musician's frustrated life in the Australian boondocks into a starry-eyed fantasy of the jazz life in Paris. Within hours of his arrival, not only does John find himself treated like Billy's long-lost soul mate, he also wows the audience at an improbable jam session in a smart Parisian club. 
"Dingo," which switches abruptly back and forth between Australia and Paris, is a film with a seriously split personality. Just when the scenes of Billy playing in the local band, trapping dingos and squabbling with his wife, Jane (Helen Buday), have begun to cohere into a pungent portrait of Australian rural life, the movie fantasizes the Parisian jazz life as a millionaire's dream world. Despite strong, volatile performances by Mr. Friels and Ms. Buday, neither half of the story ultimately gets its due. And a subplot in which Jane is tempted to run off with her husband's wealthy childhood pal Peter (Joe Petruzzi) seems extraneous. 
In his dramatic-film debut, Davis, who died in September 1991, suggests an eccentric variation of his famously reclusive, enigmatic self. Sartorially eccentric and glowering through sunglasses with gold-studded frames, he delivers his lines in a gravelly whisper, with no facial expression at all. 
Although the film's discontinuities are somewhat redeemed by its score, composed by Michel Legrand and Davis, and featuring the trumpets of Davis and Chuck Findley, the music doesn't begin to make the film's two halves fit together. 
DINGO  Directed by Rolf de Heer; written by Marc Rosenberg; director of photography, Denis Lenoir; edited by Suresh Ayyar; music by Michel Legrand and Miles Davis; production designer, Judith Russell; produced by Mr. de Heer, Giorgio Draskovic, Marie-Pascale Osterrieth and Mr. Rosenberg; released by Greycat Films. At Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village. Running time: 108 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Colin Friels (John Anderson), Miles Davis (Billy Cross), Helen Buday (Jane Anderson), Joe Petruzzi (Peter) and Bernadette Lafont (Angie Cross).

‽Herman‽,‽Films about illness almost always take stronger attitudes toward their subjects than "Herman" does. This Norwegian film, which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, adopts a strangely whimsical, erratic tone as it tells of the title character, a handsome 11-year-old boy (Anders Danielson Lie) who reveals his medical condition in his first moments on screen. 
Herman has alopecia areata, a disease that has caused him to lose his hair. It has also transformed his inner life. With opening titles that evoke the robust, ski-sweater Scandinavia of the 1950's, "Herman" can treat its young hero's sickness as a form of unwanted social rebellion, something that sets him in direct opposition to the conformity of the world in which he is growing up. 
In that sense, his medical ordeal becomes a process of liberation, punctuated by peculiar flights of fancy. For instance, for reasons that the film never needs to explain, this Norwegian boy has made Zorro his imaginary playmate. His daydreams occasionally interrupt the telling of this coming-of-age story, though they rarely reveal more about the sunny, independent-minded Herman than the audience already knows. 
Had it confined itself to the isolating effects of Herman's medical ordeal, Erik Gustavson's film would have lived up to the somber foreshadowing with which it begins. As it is, "Herman" fluctuates unpredictably between uplifting moments and upsetting ones, which may well have been what the director had in mind.  But the effect leaves the film ultimately at cross-purposes with itself, and not easily able to generate much emotion. Although young Mr. Lie, a feisty and earnest young actor, plays the title role with great sincerity, Herman remains a mild, loosely drawn character without strong impact. 
"Herman," which has a jolly, genial manner during many of its domestic scenes (and an unduly playful one when it jokes too heartily over Herman's giving a urine specimen during a medical exam), has been made with competence and care. Its look evokes a strenuously cheerful culture very like that seen on American television shows, particularly those with an inspirational edge. As Herman's parents, Elisabeth Sand and Bjorn Floberg generate a mixture of love and concern that would be appropriate for any character of Herman's tender age, with or without his health problems. Also briefly in the film is a little girl on whom Herman has a schoolboy crush -- and whose full, gorgeous head of red hair is a cruel reminder of his own situation. Their final scene together gives the film one of its stronger grace notes. 
"Herman," a gently charming film of only moderate weight, was one of last year's Academy Award nominees in the best foreign film category, where the choice of nominees has been quite controversial in recent years. "Herman" only adds fuel to that fire. Herman

‽Trespass‽,‽"Trespass" is an outlandishly melodramatic, all-male morality fable about two white firemen from Arkansas who go hunting for buried treasure in an abandoned, exceptionally photogenic factory in East St. Louis, Ill. In the course of their search, they are discovered by the members of a gang of black hoodlums who, thinking the off-duty firefighters are on-duty policemen, set out to capture and murder them.  Most of the violent cat-and-mouse game takes place inside the factory within one day that seems 96 hours long. 
The movie was written by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, best known for the "Back to the Future" comedies, and directed by Walter Hill ("Southern Comfort," "The Driver," "48 Hours"), whose hand has never been heavier. The cast is headed by Bill Paxton and William Sadler, who play the firemen (one good guy and one bad guy), and Ice-T and Ice Cube, the rap performers who appear as the two principal gang members. Art Evans gives the film's most interesting performance as a homeless black man who lives in the factory and whose routine is disturbed by the warring interlopers. 
That Mr. Gale and Mr. Zemeckis are very funny writers is nowhere apparent in "Trespass." With the exception of a running gag about the gangsters' use of cellular telephones, the film is singularly humorless.  Though full of the kind of simulated violence achieved by special-effects artists, it's not too heavy on suspense.  Everything in the screenplay seems arbitrary, including the firefighting jobs assigned to the two would-be treasure-seekers. They could as easily be magazine salesmen or amateur songwriters. 
The movie also never makes clear the crimes of choice of this particular gang, though drugs would seem to be obvious. Ice-T and Ice Cube may be ravaging rappers on records and television, but they seem to be especially lightweight presences in "Trespass," less menacing than attitudinizing.  They both adopt fixed frowns and use a lot racial epithets, but their favorite 12-letter obscenity now sounds like an endearment. In particular, Ice Cube appears to have been denatured, possibly because he's denied recourse to the crotch-clutching gesture that best defines the politics of his music videos. 
Mr. Hill has difficulty filling the running time. There is much creeping around litter-filled corridors, stairwells, chimneys and air shafts. Hostages are taken. Every now and then a fierce gunfight breaks out, at which point the film's sound levels are turned up to awaken the drowsy. 
"Trespass," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of obscene language and violence.

‽Peter's Friends‽,‽"Peter's Friends," a cheerfully derivative comedy about a group of old friends enjoying a house-party reunion, borrows so blatantly from "The Big Chill" that it takes a while to realize this film has some life of its own. Once again, the principals are brought together to reconsider the courses of their lives. Once again, these decisions are made to the tune of an ebullient rock soundtrack. Once again, thoughts of mortality lend substance to what otherwise would look like lighthearted fun. 
The setting this time is a grand English manor house, which Peter (Stephen Fry) has recently inherited in one of the film's more conspicuous coming-of-age touches. A decade earlier, the principals were college chums joining forces to stage a giddy New Year's Eve musical revue. But they are now at a more serious stage in their lives. 
Maggie (Emma Thompson) is desperately lonely, and determined to do something about it. Roger and Mary (Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton) are recovering from the loss of a child. Sarah (Alphonsia Emmanuel) has embarked on one too many ill-considered affairs, this one with Brian (Tony Slattery), a married actor. Brian's biggest dramatic accomplishment is feigning interest in what others have to say. 
Kenneth Branagh, who produced and directed the film, also appears as Andrew, who once aspired to be a serious playwright and is now best known as the creator of an American sitcom. Appearing as Carol, his brassy American wife, is Rita Rudner, who wrote the screenplay with her husband, Martin Bergman, and all but steals the film. "Did you ever see 'Upstairs, Downstairs?' " Carol worriedly asks Peter's cook, who has somehow failed to jump at her orders the way they do back in Hollywood. 
Arriving with a load of exercise equipment and a Rodeo Drive wardrobe that is a comedy act all by itself, Ms. Rudner's Carol makes no bones about not fitting in with her husband's English friends. Looking around the manor, she denies that a house of hers in Bel Air was vulgar, saying, "It was just like this, only everything was brand new." Inspecting her room, she complains to Peter about the lack of a television set, only to learn there are none anywhere in the house. "That's all right, I'll read," she says bravely. "Does anyone have a book?" 
As the foil to such a flamboyant character, Mr. Branagh has a lot to work with. "If we stay together five years, I get free hair transplants and she gets a new set of breasts," he tells Peter, while discussing the likely longevity of the marriage. "So then she'll have four?" Peter asks. "No, her agent gets one," Andrew answers. 
Although "Peter's Friends" eventually sounds a note of gravity, and although it addresses AIDS more directly than many films have, it remains a lightweight entertainment, enjoyable mostly for the fun of hearing arch, skillful actors deliver droll remarks. Mr. Branagh's direction is blithe and serviceable without having any particular hallmarks, save perhaps an appreciation of the talent he has assembled. If the film didn't have two vulgar show-biz characters to make fun of, it would have a lot less verve. 
Ms. Thompson is once again a delight, fidgeting nervously in shapeless smocks until Ms. Rudner's Carol says, "You are a very pretty girl, yes, but you make Mother Teresa look like a hooker." As Maggie, she is so insecure that she leaves Polaroids of herself all over her apartment for the benefit of her cat, who apparently couldn't care less. Maggie's desire to win over Peter is only one of the romantic currents that keep the film more or less in motion. Another subplot has to do with the promiscuity of Sarah, of whom Andrew says: "You know those mice that go round on wheels? Imagine one wearing a tight leather skirt." "Peter's Friends," sunny and superficial, works best on the level of quips like that.

‽
‽Hoffa‽,‽IN his 1960 book, "The Enemy Within," Robert F. Kennedy, soon to be the Attorney General of the United States, wrote about his first face-to-face meeting with the man he had sworn to send to prison, James R. Hoffa, the powerful president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Kennedy was surprised by how short the labor leader was, "only five feet five and a half." 
Anyone who knows anything about Hoffa's rise and fall will be similarly surprised by how much he's grown in "Hoffa," the riveting, almost impressionistic new film biography, written with mean brilliance by David Mamet and directed by Danny DeVito in a splashy style best described as Las Vegas Empire. 
The film not only presents a Jimmy Hoffa with the beefed-up physical dimensions of Jack Nicholson, who gives a gigantic powerhouse of a performance, but it also effectively rearranges the hierarchy of American heroes as it's understood in the 1990's. Many people may be uncomfortably surprised. 
"Hoffa" sees Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 in the middle of his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, as he was perceived by Hoffa: a whiny, aggressive, Harvard-educated rich kid desperate for publicity, ready to use fair means and foul to trap Hoffa, and no match at all for Hoffa in their furious verbal confrontations. 
Mr. DeVito and Mr. Mamet don't whitewash Hoffa, but they seem almost nonjudgmental about him. By omission they appear to sanction a complicated, very dubious, if colorful, character. In the context of most commercial movies today, which insist on explaining too much or repeating the obvious at seemingly endless length, "Hoffa" remains cool and detached, not unlike Mr. DeVito's very funny, very dark comedy, "The War of the Roses." Yet "Hoffa" is not a comedy. It is a take on history. 
It's a serious consideration of the career of a man whose gift for the expedient and personally profitable alliance was the near-equal of Talleyrand's. Hoffa's ties to the Mafia not only cost the rank-and-file teamsters millions of dollars but also set a pattern for corruption that tainted the entire labor movement. His is a quintessentially American story, for only in America did Big Labor become a big business to rival Big Business. 
"Hoffa" is a remarkable movie, an original and vivid cinematic work, but is that enough? I think it is. Others will have legitimate objections to the ways the film operates. 
Mr. DeVito and Mr. Mamet stay at a discreet distance from Hoffa, neither sentimentalizing him nor attempting to analyze him beyond his own automatic defense that you have to do it unto others before others do it unto you. Without comment, and in very general terms, they document Hoffa's evolution from small-time labor reformer to big-time labor racketeer, master shakedown artist and influence-peddler, and friend to mobsters of frightening moment. 
The tale is told in a series of flashbacks from the last day of Hoffa's life. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa disappeared forever, having been shot, according to some reports, his body placed inside an automobile compactor, the remains then buried in a location that no one yet has discovered. 
The movie opens as the nervous, exhausted Jimmy, accompanied by his trusted factotum and pal, a fictitious character named Bobby Ciaro (Mr. DeVito), waits in the back seat of a Cadillac in the parking lot of a roadhouse near Detroit. Jimmy has an appointment with a long-time Mafia associate who, he hopes, will support him in his attempts to win back his place as the teamsters' president. Convicted of jury-tampering and sent to jail in 1967, Jimmy was paroled in 1971 on the condition that he remain out of union politics until 1980. It's not a condition he has ever taken seriously. 
The recollections that are the body of the film are not Jimmy's, but the adoring, busy Bobby's. Bobby can't sit still. He paces around the parking lot, goes into the roadhouse to make phone calls, returns with paper cups of coffee for Jimmy, reminisces a bit, gets out of the car again and paces. 
Bobby frets over Jimmy's situation, recalling his first meeting with the vital, energetic Jimmy in the depressed 1930's when, one night on the road, Jimmy invited himself into the cab of his truck and attempted to recruit him for the teamsters. Jimmy was then something of an idealist. As the long day passes in the parking lot, Bobby chronologically remembers his way through Jimmy's career: their days as members of a teamster goon squad, torching a company that failed to recognize the union; Jimmy's success in a brutal confrontation with police while organizing the Railway Transport workers, and his introduction to the Mafia in the person of (the fictitious) Carol D'Allesandro (Armand Assante). He's the film's representation of the forces that provided much of the pressure and muscle that made possible Hoffa's rise within the teamsters' union. 
In one of the film's more bizarre inventions, Bobby remembers a crucial hunting trip during which D'Allesandro outlines the ways Jimmy might manipulate the teamsters' pension fund to make loans to the mob and enrich all concerned, with the exception of the membership. As the two men are signing an agreement on the back of a hunting license, Bobby, not a natural hunter, spots a sluggish deer, takes out his pistol and shoots it between the eyes. 
Although Bobby's memory is fond, "Hoffa" sees all impassively, with a shrug that seems to ask, "Well, what can you do about it?" This gives "Hoffa" a bitterly skeptical edge that is rare in American movies. It forces viewers to make up their own minds, something that can be immensely disorienting as well as rewarding. The film suggests there are times when you have to think for yourself. 
A more reasonable objection to the movie is the way it necessarily foreshortens history, simplifies events, and either ignores important real-life characters or reinvents them as composites. This is dramatic license, but dramatic license often seriously distorts, which is not easily acceptable when the subject is as rich and significant as the Jimmy Hoffa story. 
The movie notes in passing, but doesn't appear to understand, Hoffa's real achievement in negotiating the precedent-setting National Master Freight Agreement, guaranteeing teamsters uniform wage and benefit conditions across the country. The movie also doesn't begin to suggest the profound complexity of Hoffa's connections to the mob, his relations to his wife and family, and the teamsters' connections to the Government. A lot has been left out, which is unfortunate, since the snarl of these relationships is what seems finally to have done him in. 
The great thing about "Hoffa" is that it doesn't pretend to be a docudrama or anything like it. It's not a vulgarized rip-off of Costa-Gavras movies, reduced to the exploitation of the latest case of murder, kidnapping or child molestation, or a briefly notorious domestic disagreement. "Hoffa" is an original work of fiction, based on fact, conceived with imagination and a consistent point of view. 
In addition to Mr. Assante and Mr. DeVito, the excellent supporting cast includes J. T. Walsh as Hoffa's colleague and successor, Frank Fitzsimmons; John C. Reilly as a protege who squeals on Hoffa; Natalija Nogulich, briefly seen as Jimmy's wife; Kevin Anderson as Robert Kennedy; Frank Whaley as a young man befriended by Bobby in the course of the day in the roadhouse parking lot, and Robert Prosky as another early associate of Jimmy. 
Mr. DeVito's direction is full of extravagant gestures that seem entirely in keeping with Bobby's highly colored memories of life with Jimmy. There are a number of grand overhead shots, as if the camera were in the position of a gaudy casino chandelier, whether it's a scene of Jimmy in prison or a panoramic view of union men fighting scabs. At the same time, Mr. DeVito knows when to use close-ups, that is, to reveal character rather than to punctuate dialogue. When the director shows a remembered explosion and fire, they have the huge proportions of something reported in a tall story told late at night in a favorite bar. 
Mr. Nicholson has altered his looks, voice and speech to evoke Hoffa, but the performance is composed less of superficial tricks than of the actor's crafty intelligence and conviction. The performance is spookily compelling without being sympathetic for a minute. Unlike Norman Jewison's "F.I.S.T." (1978), an underrated Sylvester Stallone movie about a Hoffa-like character, the new film doesn't mourn Jimmy's lost innocence. "Hoffa" is a tough movie about American life. It hasn't time for tears. 
"Hoffa," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), is full of obscene language and violence.

‽
‽Indochine‽,‽Catherine Deneuve reigns in "Indochine." That is, she presides over its second-rate fiction with the manner of an empress who knows her powers are constitutionally limited but who continues to take her duties seriously.  She can't change the course of the film, but her lofty presence keeps it from flying apart. She plays Eliane who, when first met in 1930, divides her time between a mansion near Saigon and a successful rubber plantation, which she oversees with (sometimes for) her widowed father. 
Miss Deneuve has her work cut out for her, since the new French film, made on location at great expense and with attention to historical accuracy, intends to be nothing less than epic. "Indochine" is the story of the last 25 years of French rule in Indochina as reflected by the events in Eliane's life. The subject is potentially rich, but the screenplay, whomped up by three screenwriters in collaboration with Regis Wargnier, the director, has neither the conviction of fact, the sense of revelation found in good fiction, nor the fun of trashy literature. 
In 1930 Eliane enjoys all the perks that accrue to the dominant class in a smoothly functioning colonial society. Though French by birth, she has never seen France. She was born and reared in Indochina, which she considers as much her home as it is for the anonymous laborers who work on her plantation. Eliane is not as bigoted as some French. She is bringing up Camille (Linh Dan Pham) as her own daughter. The pretty teen-ager, an Annamese princess, was adopted by Eliane after her parents -- Eliane's best friends -- were killed in an accident. 
Since Eliane is France to a large extent, it's not surprising that her life falls apart more or less in concert with French colonial rule, and that her heartbreak and (dare I say?) her hopes parallel those of France itself.  She's sorely tried, both as an adoring mother and as the conscience of a great European nation. 
Camille has been betrothed since childhood to Tanh (Eric Nguyen), a well-born Vietnamese fellow whom she likes but does not love. She shatters her adoptive mother by falling madly in love with Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez), a handsome, mostly uncharacterized French naval officer, who had once been Eliane's lover. 
Eliane puts her foot down, but Camille runs off to join Jean-Baptiste at the remote outpost to which Eliane has arranged that he be sent. It's the beginning of the end for both the motherland and Eliane. I'm not giving away one-tenth of what happens in the movie by reporting that the feckless Tanh turns out to be a sort of Vietnamese Scarlet Pimpernel, a dedicated, recklessly brave Vietnamese freedom fighter and Communist. 
Camille, too, is politicized, becoming known as "the red princess" for her underground activities. When last heard from in 1954, she's at the table in Geneva, a member of the Indochinese committee negotiating independence from France. 
It's not easy for any movie, even one running for 2 hours and 35 minutes, to cover so much time and history and still maintain its coherence as drama. Though Eliane is the film's focal point, she is not Scarlett O'Hara.  Eliane has her weaknesses: she falls in love with the wrong man, and she occasionally seeks solace in a pipe of opium. Yet she's not so much a character as a beautiful, somewhat frosty icon, like the statue of Marianne, the official symbol of the French Republic for which Miss Deneuve's likeness was used in 1985. 
Without seeming to age a day from 1930 to 1954, Miss Deneuve moves through "Indochine" more as an observer than as a participant. Her Eliane/Marianne is not an embodiment of the ideals of the French Revolution, but a representation of the kind of chic associated with Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. 
She looks ravishing from start to finish. She's supremely unruffled when a man with a nosebleed attempts to make love to her. Not a hair is out of place as she beats a worker for attempting to run away from the plantation. She's not a particular woman but an abstraction as she tells the victim, "Do you think I like beating my children?" 
In spite of all that, Miss Deneuve lends the movie a lot of her own instinctive intelligence. Behind the movie-star facade, a real actress is at work. It's not her regal beauty but the force of her personality that carries the viewer through a choppy screenplay not always easy to follow. It may be that the film has been re-edited for its American release, but whatever the reason, characters seem to disappear before their time, or to appear on screen without having been properly introduced. In the etiquette of cinema, this is called rude editing.  There also are times when the soundtrack music hails an emotional crescendo that only it recognizes. 
Aside from Miss Deneuve's performance, the only one worth noting is that of Jean Yanne, whose acting style has become increasingly self-important and busy since the early 1970's when he appeared in two fine Claude Chabrol films, "This Man Must Die" and "Le Boucher." Here he plays the head of the French security police in Saigon, a jaded functionary who half-heartedly courts Eliane while wearily going about his brutal job. 
"Indochine" offers the audience much more history and many more views of the Vietnamese landscape than can be seen in "The Lover," Jean-Jacques Annaud's fine, laconic screen adaptation of the Marguerite Duras novel, also set in Vietnam in the 1930's. Yet "The Lover" evokes subtle truths about colonial relationships that are effectively buried in the epic fanciness of "Indochine." 
"Indochine," which has been rated PG-13 (under 13 strongly cautioned), has scenes of violence.

‽
‽Toys‽,‽BARRY LEVINSON'S "Toys" is a magnificent mess, a chaotic fantasy set in a brilliantly vivid, Surreal landscape that recalls the paintings of Magritte and the pop-up illustrations in children's books. Dada is also evoked, though less consistently. "Toys" dazzles the eye even as the mind goes numb attending to the narrative, which is about the apocalyptic battle for control of Zevo Toys, where whimsy is said to be a tradition but is more like a curse. 
Here is a nonmusical "Babes in Toyland" crossed with "Dr. Strangelove," a danceless "Nutcracker" that suggests "Paradise Lost," yet plays as if it were the nightmare of a child of 4. "Toys" is supposed to be spontaneous and fun, but it has a drearily self-important message stolen from a bumper sticker: War is hazardous to children and other living things. 
It's impossible to tell for whom this movie was made. 
Very young children would seem to be the target audience, though they won't have a clue as to what's going on. Their adult companions will be driven to dreamless slumber. Masochistic film students may possibly respond. The confusions of "Toys" are so many that they appear intentional, as if arcane truths were to be discovered somewhere within. 
Just before ailing old Kenneth Zevo (Donald O'Connor) dies, he entrusts the family toy company to his brother, the mad General Zevo (Michael Gambon), whose life has been without purpose since the end of the cold war. Thus passed over are Leslie (Robin Williams) and Alsatia Zevo (Joan Cusack), Kenneth's children, both of whom acknowledge that they are too innocent to run the factory that is their world. 
Leslie spends his days moving happily around the assembly lines where smiling workers put together dolls, stuffed animals and the kinds of harmless toys that kids drop out of car windows. He is especially fond of novelties made for joke stores: water glasses that drip, fake deviled eggs and blobs of plastic in the shape of what the movie genteelly calls dog poop. At one point he demonstrates a spectacular smoking jacket, which is a jacket that emits smoke. 
Alsatia is more interested in paper dolls, and wears clothes that are fixed to her body as if they were paper-doll outfits. At the end of the day, Leslie and Alsatia go home to their pretty pop-up Victorian mansion, set among a series of vast green, treeless hills, where Alsatia sleeps in what looks to be a golden sarcophagus shaped like a duck. 
Meanwhile, the general sets about to turn Zevo Toys into a high-tech armaments plant. His inspiration: the cool reflexes displayed by little boys playing the kinds of video war games that Zevo has firmly refused to manufacture. The general's idea is to revolutionize war by the development of miniature, nuclear-equipped airplanes, rockets and whatnot that any child could operate by remote control. 
It takes Leslie and Alsatia some time to realize that things aren't what they used to be at Zevo Toys. Trusted employees are being let go, including the lady who used to paint lips on alligators. The general hires storm troopers to protect his private laboratories. His curiosity piqued, Leslie sneaks into the general's workshop one day to discover the awful truth: a huge collection of vile video games and war toys. Leslie's reaction: "My God, F. A. O. Schwarzkopf!" 
War soon erupts at Zevo Toys as the forces of heaven, led by Leslie and Alsatia, take on those of hell, the general's mechanized, computerized toys, which initially massacre the teddy bears, dolls and novelties that Leslie throws into the struggle. It's just one of the many contradictions of "Toys" that the film, which is antiwar, comes to life only in this spectacular if muddled confrontation.  In the context of a movie that makes such a big thing of innocence, the mayhem of the battle is pretty strong stuff, especially when a principal character is decapitated. 
There are, in fact, a number of wars going on in this antiwar movie.  The most apparent is the struggle between the brilliant imagination of Ferdinando Scarfiotti, the production designer, and the banal, fake-innocent conceits of Mr. Levinson, who directed the movie and wrote the screenplay with Valerie Curtin.  Though Mr. Scarfiotti is reported to have used Dada as an inspiration for the film's look, nothing in the script has much to do with Dada's resolute antipathy to reason. "Toys" doesn't exalt randomness. It is the victim of it. The film has no consistent vision.  Even worse, it's not very funny. Leslie, Alsatia and their friends laugh more often than the audience does. 
Mr. Williams seems peculiarly subdued. His monologues in "Good Morning, Vietnam" have far more to do with the exuberant iconoclasm of Dada than does anything in "Toys." He has the occasional rude line, but he spends most of the film behaving with immense politeness, which is apparently to be equated with innocence. 
There's also something fatally wrongheaded about the film's attempts to equate Leslie's humane impulses with the sorts of toys that for perfectly good reason, would bore most children today. No adult of a certain age can have forgotten how quickly the windup toy always ran down. Though war toys aren't great, "Toys" sometimes gives the impression that it would like to disinvent everything that's battery-operated and remote-controlled. 
While "Toys" means to celebrate the benign paternalism of Zevo Toys before the maniacal general takes over, it presents a far scarier picture of assembly-line labor than anything in "Modern Times." Beneath giant plaster heads of pastel-colored animals, the Zevo workers go about their tasks with the blank expressions of people who have been lobotomized and then had smiles surgically fixed to their faces. 
It takes time to get the full measure of the film's failure. Not since "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" has there been a movie set in such a stylish, hermetically sealed environment, calling up a world where absolutely nothing is real. The effect is sort of pleasant for a while, like being in a weightless state. Eventually, though, whimsy takes over, nausea threatens and patience runs out. 
Mr. Gambon ("The Singing Detective") has fun as the mad general, but it's a role that Mr. Williams might have done equally well, and with some of the mania that "Toys" so desperately lacks. The only two performers who come out of this film unscathed are Robin Wright, who plays Leslie's sweetly dippy girlfriend, and LL Cool J, the rap performer, who appears as the white general's black son. The screenplay offers no explanation for this color difference, which becomes one of its few good jokes. 
Mr. Levinson reportedly hoped to direct "Toys" years ago as his first film, but good fortune kept getting in the way as he went on to direct "Diner," "Tin Men, "Good Morning, Vietnam," "Rain Man" and "Bugsy," among other hits. 
His luck finally ran out. 
"Toys" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some vulgar language and simulated violence.

‽
‽Leap of Faith‽,‽It is a tacit seasonal tradition that smaller, more interesting films arriving in December are often trampled in the all-star holiday stampede. It would be too bad if that happened to "Leap of Faith," the lively story of an Elmer Gantry for the computer age. 
Well acted and amusingly told, featuring a fine performance by Steve Martin in the central role, this tale ultimately switches gears and takes a deeply serious turn. "If I get the job done, what difference does it make?" Mr. Martin's Rev. Jonas Nightengale, a bogus faith healer, asks twice during the story. The second answer he receives sums up the film's fundamental message: "It makes all the difference in the world." 
"Leap of Faith" begins by pointing out that Jonas is a person of real talent. Sweet-talking a highway patrolman out of giving him a ticket, Jonas instinctively guesses where the man's vulnerabilities lie and exploits those weaknesses brilliantly. He likes to perform such feats with the help of Jane (Debra Winger), the clever manager who gives Jonas constant back talk and runs every aspect of his traveling road show. 
Jane even feeds Jonas helpful information using an earpiece and a radio transmitter. This preacher might well be able to wow audiences on his own, but it helps to have Jane studying a floor plan of the faithful, telling him exactly where to find the heavy drinker, the pregnant teen-ager, the worker who has just been laid off or the farmer who is desperate for rain. That way Jonas, who leaps and skips and works the stage like a rock star, can shout all the appropriate "Halleluljahs!" and dazzle listeners with his intuition. 
Jonas's large entourage ordinarily plays good-size cities. But when a bus breaks down, the group is forced to stay in a small, impoverished Kansas town. As the flimflam operation rolls into tiny Rustwater, the soundtrack offers exactly the right musical accompaniment: "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" from "Guys and Dolls," the song about a con artist getting his comeuppance from the faithful, as performed in a lilting reggae version by Don Henley. The film is full of similarly small, perfect touches, and never makes the mistake of calling attention to them. 
As directed with care and intelligence by Richard Pearce ("The Long Walk Home," "Country"), "Leap of Faith" turns cynicism into a peculiar virtue. This is demonstrated in a wonderful montage that shows Jonas's "Miracles and Wonders" road show setting up in Rustwater after Jane, who is the group's resident charmer, has sweet-talked a permit out of the local sheriff (Liam Neeson). In this montage, all the con artists' tricks are revealed: a full supply of crutches and wheelchairs, a system for tipping off Jonas about the audience, a life-size statue of Jesus passed around by roadies as if it were a prop in a rock show. 
Yet amid all this activity something miraculous really does begin to happen. Mr. Pearce spins together an inspiring sequence as the tent rises up, the show comes together, the gospel choir rehearses gloriously as the singers stand simply by the side of the road. At this moment, the audience can simultaneously feel the dual strengths of faith and doubt just as surely as Jonas can. It is thus prepared for the crisis of confidence upon which this story, like any "Rainmaker"-type tale, must eventually hinge. 
Mr. Martin's performance, surprisingly jaunty under the circumstances, is as remarkable for its restraint as for its energy. The temptation to reduce Jonas's slickness to broad parody is gracefully avoided; so is the immense maudlin potential of any tale in which the con man comes to sympathize with the little people and regret the error of his ways. Rolling into town unabashedly in a T-shirt, cowboy hat and gold chain, Mr. Martin's Jonas is a model of self-assurance, and the public be damned. "Always look better than they do," he jokes, while getting dressed for a show. 
As "Leap of Faith" slowly closes in on Jonas's spiritual crisis, it heads for trouble. In conventional Hollywood terms, at least, there is no way to embrace this film's ultimate outlook without losing part of the audience along the way. To its credit, this film sticks to its convictions and ignores that worry, at the expense of a happy-ending payoff or a clear resolution. Yet the attempt to take the central question of faith seriously becomes gratifying in its own, much quieter way. 
As written colorfully by Janus Cercone, "Leap of Faith" includes a number of potentially sentimental subplots, including one involving a pretty waitress (Lolita Davidovich) and her disabled brother (Lukas Haas, so well cast that he and Ms. Davidovich seem to share a family resemblance). Jonas dispenses with any weepy aspects of this situation by snappishly calling the boy "Tiny Tim," and takes a similarly caustic attitude throughout the movie. Another subplot, linking Ms. Winger's Jane to Mr. Neeson's sheriff, also risks turning sticky. But Ms. Winger, very well matched as a pal of Mr. Martin's, ably adopts the glib, self-protecting banter that gets these phony healers through the day. Even as the sarcasm falls away later in the story, and even when surrounded by a shower of miraculous butterflies (one of the few fancy effects used), Ms. Winger's Jane remains appealingly direct. 
From its small-town coffee shop to its "I Am Saved" T-shirts, "Leap of Faith" has the right look for the story it means to tell. Immense support is provided by the Angels of Mercy, the real-life singers (including La Chanze, Delores Hall and Albertina Walker) who do a beautiful job of playing Jonas's gospel choir.

‽
‽Forever Young‽,‽"Forever Young" has the manner of something that was made in the kind of perfect vacuum that can be achieved only in a Hollywood bell jar. Here's a romantic comedy in which Mel Gibson plays a pre-World War II test pilot who, accidently defrosted after spending more than half a century in a cryogenic capsule, learns about life and love in 1992. 
When first seen in 1939, Daniel McCormick (Mr. Gibson) seems to have the world in the palm of his hand. He's not only at the top of his class as a flier, but he's also in love with and loved by an ideal woman, Helen (Isabel Glasser), a successful magazine photographer. Daniel has one small failing: marriage scares him, though for no reason more special than that the story requires it. 
When Helen is suddenly run over in the street and declared brain dead, the distraught Daniel volunteers to be the first human guinea pig in a cryogenic experiment. After all, he's not going anyplace, nor is Helen. He accepts his deep-freeze willingly. What with one thing and another, including World War II, he's forgotten until two small boys of the 1990's come upon his abandoned but still icy crypt in a warehouse. It's at this point that "Forever Young," which has been unraveling for some time, really starts. 
Written by Jeffrey Abrams ("Regarding Henry") and directed by Steve Miner, "Forever Young" has nothing much to do with anything except the movie conventions of an earlier time when near-fatal accidents, wild coincidences and miraculous resurrections were the way life was lived on the silver screen. Plausibility is not important in this sort of movie; everything depends on the charm, style and verve with which it's played. 
This is Mr. Gibson's department. He passes through "Forever Young" with the self-assurance of a Hollywood star of the great studio era, someone who in good pictures and bad remains magically and consistently his own idealized self. Mr. Gibson is good enough to give the film substance, making "Forever Young" far easier to sit through than it has any right to be. 
Jamie Lee Curtis also is attractive as Claire, the gutsy 1990's woman who befriends Daniel and with whom he has a brief flirtation, almost forgetting his still strong commitment to the memory of the brain-dead Helen. I shouldn't reveal more about the plot except to emphasize that, brain death aside, it is a romantic comedy. 
This is not always apparent while one is watching the film. Though "Forever Young" initially would have you believe that Daniel and Helen share some kind of transforming passion, Helen is forgotten for much of the running time. The heart is earnestly warmed instead by Daniel's friendship with Claire's 11-year-old son, Nat (Elijah Wood), whom he teaches to fly. There are also some obligatory Rip Van Winkle gags about Daniel's reaction to television, telephone answering machines and such. 
"Forever Young" looks to be very much a star vehicle. Because of that, it may not be fair to blame either the writer or director for its lack of narrative focus. The star is the center of everything. The physical production is handsome and elaborate, but nothing deflects attention from Mr. Gibson for any length of time, not even Ms. Curtis. Ms. Glasser is not around long enough to establish her own screen presence. Even George Wendt, the formidably funny "Cheers" star, who plays the inventor of Daniel's deep-freeze chamber, does not make much of an impression. 
The only thing that gives Mr. Gibson competition is a great Billie Holiday recording of the Ray Noble standard "The Very Thought of You." Daniel and Helen consider it their song. It later turns up as a favorite of Claire in 1992. Lady Day was not exactly a household name in 1939. That Daniel and Helen should have cherished her then lends them more class and character than anything else in the movie. 
"Forever Young" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mildly vulgar language.

‽Passion Fish‽,‽May-Alice (Mary McDonnell) was on her way to a leg-waxing appointment when her life changed forever. Hit by a car as she got out of a taxicab in New York City, May-Alice was left permanently paralyzed. She formerly worked as a soap-opera actress, but nothing she simulated on television can match the drama her real life now offers. She is seen in a hospital, waking up to the daunting facts of her new life, as John Sayles's "Passion Fish" begins. 
Stunned at first, May-Alice soon develops a caustically bitter way of dealing with her frustration. She keeps to herself and drinks too much. She remains angry and proud. She mocks those who try to help her and, even more mercilessly, she mocks herself. "It's important that we have clean walls," she snaps at one of the many nurses she employs briefly, then fires or scares away. "I'll be climbing them soon." 
When solicitous old friends come to visit, after May-Alice has relocated to her girlhood home in Louisiana, she is even worse. "Didn't we always say, 'I wonder how May-Alice is going to end up?' " asks one chatty, thoughtless matron who drops by. May-Alice stares, drilling holes into her guest's empty head. "Well, now you know," she flatly replies. 
"Passion Fish," a film much less precious than its title (which refers to a Cajun superstition about finding love), is about the spiritual rebirth that finally occurs within May-Alice.  It's also about the strong, sympathetic helpmate who makes such regeneration possible. The right nurse finally comes along in the person of Chantelle (Alfre Woodard), who is only slightly cowed by May-Alice's insults and has had enough troubles of her own to understand her employer's mean streak. 
As played memorably by Ms. Woodard, a quietly voluptuous actress who conveys vast inner strength, Chantelle is willing to help May-Alice only on her own terms, thus providing the kind of toughness and back talk her patient desperately needs. "Have you been doing this long?" May-Alice asks Chantelle curtly during their job interview.  "No," Chantelle answers. "You?" 
If this situation sounds fraught with the danger of sentimentality, it certainly is. But Mr. Sayles's writing and direction are refreshingly blunt, going over the top only when taking cheap shots at some of May-Alice's tiresome old friends. Though the story is essentially house-bound, set in the soothing Louisiana household as May-Alice gradually re-establishes herself there, it manages to introduce a varied stream of visitors. Collectively, they keep the film moving and prevent it from looking inward to a stultifying degree. 
"Passion Fish" was also edited by Mr. Sayles, who adopts a leisurely pace and often slows down to emphasize the seductive charm of Cajun culture. His film is warmly appealing, played with subtlety and intelligence by both its stars. But like many of this season's releases, "Passion Fish" is needlessly long. With a two-and-a-quarter-hour running time, this essentially modest film often seems to be luxuriating in the story of Chantelle and May-Alice rather than making sure that story gets told. 
Also in "Passion Fish," and well matched with Ms. McDonnell's touchingly stubborn May-Alice, is David Strathairn as a Louisiana native who looked good to her as a teen-ager, and looks even better now that he is a father of five. Mr. Strathairn appears in two of the film's more magical sequences, a dream that restores May-Alice to her earlier, sexually adventurous self and an all-day boat ride through the bayou that becomes a larger sort of journey. In these sequences, Mr. Strathairn's handsome, down-to-earth Rennie serves as both a reminder of everyday reality and a secret avenue of escape. 
Also contributing mightily to the Southern charm of "Passion Fish" are Vondie Curtis-Hall as the rural blacksmith who somehow persuades the wary Chantelle to let down her guard, and Leo Burmester as the wayward, tippling uncle in two-toned shoes, a colorful sine qua non in such a story. Sheila Kelley and Angela Bassett (Betty Shabazz in "Malcolm X") have some good moments as a couple of soap opera queens from May-Alice's past. 
Equally helpful, on a different note, is Marianne Muellerleile as the scariest and most exacting in a long parade of unlucky nurses. The nurses' scenes are edited together in a funny, bad-audition type montage, during which one particularly pesty nurse insists on grilling May-Alice about other stars (with character names like Raven and Dominique), whom she presumably knows from other soaps. "There's not like a room where they store us all between shows," May-Alice replies in exasperation. 
"Passion Fish" opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, where it will play for the one-week run necessary for Academy Award eligibility.  Its gentle manner contrasts nicely with the hot air of many higher-powered Christmas releases.

‽
‽A Few Good Men‽,‽The role doesn't have to be big, but if it's good, and if the actor playing it is great, the results can be magically transforming. Witness Jack Nicholson's vicious, funny, superbly reptilian turn in Rob Reiner's entertaining "A Few Good Men," adapted by Aaron Sorkin from his hit Broadway courtroom drama. 
Mr. Nicholson doesn't steal the film, which would mean that he somehow separates himself from everybody else in it. Rather, in the course of only a handful of scenes, he seems to suffuse the entire production, giving it a weight, density and point that might not otherwise be apparent. 
The role, beautifully written, is made to Mr. Nicholson's order. It's that of Col. Nathan R. Jessep of the United States Marine Corps, a tough, bigoted Vietnam veteran, a career officer shaped by decades of cold-war politics. By chance, Jessep is stationed in that last corner of the earth where the cold war goes on as if there were no yesterday. 
He's the commander of the marines stationed at the American naval base on the southwestern coast of Cuba at Guantanamo Bay, on a small bit of arid real estate protecting one of the best anchorages in the western Atlantic, a legacy of the Spanish-American War. It's there that the United States and Cuba, separated by barbed wire and command posts, have continued to co-exist through the Bay of Pigs invasion, the great missile crisis and a continuing, crippling economic embargo, in one of the strangest examples of symbiosis to be found in all of international relations. 
This geographic fact becomes a central image in the film adaptation, which gracefully opens up the story of a military court-martial without allowing the tension to evaporate. There are times when the movie seems to force-feed the audience essential information, and when the audience might well wonder whether the emotional crises of the defense lawyers really are of more interest than the fates of the two men on trial. 
Yet such things are built into the structure and nature of the drama, which is less about the workings of the military than about the mechanics of this particular inquiry. The story is this: in the course of what appears to be a hazing incident at Guantanamo, a Marine private has died, apparently poisoned by the rag stuffed into his throat before his mouth was taped. Two enlisted men are charged with the murder. As often happens during proceedings of this sort, the victim and the men on trial become less important than the politics surrounding the case. 
The Marine Corps would like to wrap it up as quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end, a hot-shot young naval lawyer, Lieut. (j.g.) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), is assigned to the defense with the understanding that he'll persuade the defendants to accept a plea bargain. Also assigned to the defense is Lieut. Comdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), who acts as Kaffee's conscience, eventually persuading him that there is a strong possibility that the two enlisted men were, in fact, acting on orders from their officers. 
The investigation, initially undertaken by Kaffee with some reluctance, uncovers the fact that the victim, Pfc. William T. Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo), had for some time been trying to transfer out of his unit.  Also, that he had ignored both the Marine Corps code and its chain of command. He had written letters to Washington offering to testify that he had witnessed an incident in which a member of his unit had arbitrarily fired on a Cuban watchtower near the base. 
As the investigation continues, Kaffee and Galloway, who clearly never go to the movies, read a book or spend much time talking to career service personnel, are surprised to discover a kind of military mind that, to them, seems prehistoric. The two defendants at first behave like automatons.  Pfc. Louden Downey (James Marshall) is so taciturn that he seems seriously retarded. His co-defendant and spokesman, Lance Cpl. Harold W. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison), refuses all offers of help. He will stoically accept whatever punishment is meted out. The two men simply parrot the Marines' code of fidelity to unit, corps, God and country. 
On a fact-finding trip to Guantanamo, Kaffee, Galloway and their assistant Lieut. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) have their first brush with Jessep at a scary lunch, during which the colonel cheerfully lies through his teeth. For Galloway's benefit, he also describes the special kind of high one can get when having sex with a superior officer. According to Jessep, that's one of the few benefits of an integrated service. 
"A Few Good Men" doesn't pack the surprises of "Witness for the Prosecution," nor does it probe very deeply into the psyche of men who exercise the power of dictators in a society that congratulates itself on its freedoms. It's no "Full-Metal Jacket." "A Few Good Men" recalls something of "The Caine Mutiny Court Martial," though it is most troubling not for the questions it raises, but for the casual way it finally treats its two lost, utterly bewildered defendants. 
The screenplay is a good one, directed with care and acted, for the most part, with terrific conviction.  Among the supporting players who do exceptional work are Kiefer Sutherland, as a Marine officer who is a Jessep in the making; J. T. Walsh, as an officer fatally flawed by conscience; Kevin Bacon, who appears as the military prosecutor, and Mr. Bodison, a new young actor whose performance as the more prominent defendant gives the film its melancholy shock value. 
Mr. Cruise, Ms. Moore and Mr. Pollak are perfectly adequate in less flashy roles, which, unlike the others, appear to have been constructed to keep the plot moving right along. They have to play it comparatively straight, which must be maddening when the actors around them are having such a colorful time. 
Mr. Nicholson is in his own league. His Jessep is both a joy to watch because of the actor's skill, and an explanation of why the United States base at Guantanamo Bay, whatever its military value, continues to exist.  "A Few Good Men" is a big commercial entertainment of unusually satisfying order. 
"A Few Good Men," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some violence.

‽The Muppet Christmas Carol‽,‽"The Muppet Christmas Carol" is not one of those clever children's films that keep adult escorts from gazing longingly at the exit signs. What you expect -- Muppets -- is pretty much what you get. There's no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there    is    a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand. 
Michael Caine stars as Scrooge, playing the role enthusiastically and well. (It can't have been easy to smile tearfully and sing "wherever you find love it feels like Christmas" in the midst of a Muppet crowd.) But when this film's target audience watches the opening credits, don't be surprised if Fozzie Bear gets a bigger hand than any grown-up could. The Muppets, undertaking their first major acting assignment, are so scene-stealing that when they turn up within the familiar story they assume the status of celebrity guests. The Great Gonzo narrates the film as Charles Dickens, and that suspiciously green-looking Bob Cratchit is Kermit the Frog. 
There's some degree of suspense in wondering whether Mrs. Cratchit, who does not appear until late in the film, will be played by you-know-who. Miss Piggy (who is of course here) deserves to turn up in a Muppet "Madame Bovary" some day, but that's another story. In this one, some fancy special effects are also used to heighten the audience appeal of the original material, so that Scrooge flies a la Superman when he returns to his childhood with the Ghost of Christmas Past. As many past generations have known, the story works just fine without such tricks. But this version strives to be elaborate, even in the design of its ghosts: Christmas Past is a small, eerie, wide-eyed nymph and Christmas Present a chortling giant. 
Songs for this musical version of Dickens's cautionary tale have been provided by Paul Williams. But the music is seldom memorable, and the labored lyrics may go over young audiences' heads. (A lonely life "paints you with indifference like a lady paints with rouge," Mr. Williams writes, trying to rhyme "Scrooge").  Much of the music is also on the saccharine side, but little children should like that reasonably well, just as they enjoy crowd scenes featuring Muppet vegetables and other talking toys. Val Strazovec's production design offers a droll collection of snowy English rooftops and atmospheric street scenes. 
"The Muppet Christmas Carol" was co-produced and capably directed by Brian Henson, whose supervision of puppetry and special effects keeps the film on a par with earlier Muppet efforts. The screenplay, by Jerry Juhl, is less inventive, but then it must cope with the challenge of retelling Dickens in terms that will register with young children. In this regard the film does work well, bringing home the story's impact and reinforcing its central message. Even if it takes two dancing black-and-white Muppet Marleys, a passel of quill-wielding rats as Scrooge's office clerks and a collection of young frogs and pigs in the Cratchit household, this "Christmas Carol" makes a clear case for kindness and successfully warms the heart.

‽The Distinguished Gentleman‽,‽WHEN first seen in "The Distinguished Gentleman," Thomas Jefferson Johnson (Eddie Murphy) is making his way through a crowd of well-heeled Floridians at a political fund-raiser. His is the only black face in an otherwise pink and white sea of earnest contributors. In quick succession he is taken for, or passes himself off as, a waiter, a guest, an F.B.I. agent. In fact he is a small-time con artist whose most successful scam to date has been a phone-sex service: Girls of Many Nations (1-800-555-NATO), the point of which is to obtain the names and addresses of johns to be shaken down at a later date. 
Thomas's initial brush with politics is instructive. It opens his eyes to the rewards of big-time scamming in what's sometimes called the political arena. Before you have time to note the mechanics of the film, which moves with the speed and the purpose of a game of three-card monte, Thomas has got himself elected to the House of Representatives. Among his freshman colleagues: a television weather forecaster and a former football player of some regional fame. 
Thomas is a junior member of Congress, but it takes him no more than four days to secure an appointment to the prestigious House Power and Industry Committee, where the pay-offs are large and nonstop.  Thomas is on his way. 
As written by Marty Kaplan and directed by Jonathan Lynn, the sly Englishman responsible for "My Cousin Vinny" and "Nuns on the Run," "The Distinguished Gentleman" is an easy, breezy romp of a movie, a low comedy of highly entertaining order. As it tells of the meteoric rise (and magical salvation of) Thomas Jefferson Johnson, the film even manages to kid the flimsy comic conventions it so carefully observes. 
"The Distinguished Gentleman" isn't to be confused with Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," though the leading characters in both films share a nominal fondness for the same Founding Father.  That fondness is supposed to be sincere in the Capra classic. In "The Distinguished Gentleman," it's the basis for a succession of jokes. The new movie owes nothing to Capra and everything to Mr. Murphy's earlier days on "Saturday Night Live" as one of television's greatest revue artists. Though it has a coherent narrative and continuing characters, "The Distinguished Gentleman" has the random, off-the-wall charm of a series of black-out sketches: short, often manic dramatic inventions in which reason is turned inside out and no pieties are safe. Take the montage in which Thomas and his aides, the same crew that helped him run his phone-sex business, start a telephone campaign to persuade the right Washington people that Thomas should be on the Power and Industry Committee. 
Mr. Murphy's Thomas is a genius on the telephone, as easily adopting the vocal inflections of a clenched-jaw Connecticut accent as those of a fellow who sounds as if he were the ghost of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Murphy's Yiddish accent isn't great but, in these loose and scatterbrained circumstances, it will do. 
There is something contagious as well as hilarious about Thomas's delight when, once he's in the Washington swing, he becomes the recipient of so many perks. He listens sympathetically as a lobbyist tells him that automatic weapons have been given a bad rap. But even Thomas is surprised when, sharing a blind with some M16-carrying duck hunters, only one bird is bagged. Thomas's comment: "It must have had a heart attack." 
The star is surrounded by a group of equally inventive and tireless supporting actors. Sheryl Lee Ralph, memorably funny as Robert De Niro's outspoken mistress in "Mistress," is a joy as Loretta, Thomas's helpful cousin who works as the entire stable of telephone sweethearts for his phone-sex business. Lane Smith, the courtly prosecuting attorney in "My Cousin Vinny," plays the crooked chairman of the Power and Industry Committee. He's a white politician who recognizes the value in Thomas's widest, toothiest, most unthreatening grin, which is pretty much the reason Thomas is allowed to sit on the committee. 
Joe Don Baker, Kevin McCarthy and Grant Shaud appear as some of the other less than noble political types. Sarah Carson doesn't have a large role, but she is not easily forgotten as the beautiful, frosty young white woman who more than lives up to her job description ("consummate public servant"). Victoria Rowell plays the sweetly committed young black woman who threatens to make Thomas into an honest man. 
"The Distinguished Gentleman" is not as subversive as Mr. Murphy's recent "Boomerang." In that film, you remember, he plays an unrepentant male chauvinist in a yuppie world as exclusively black as it is exclusively white in almost every other movie. "The Distinguished Gentleman" isn't quite as adventurous, and certainly not as romantic. Instead, it reflects a mostly integrated world, much like the one that television sitcoms see all around them, though few sitcoms have the wit or edge Mr. Lynn brings to this movie. 
"The Distinguished Gentleman," which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), has a lot of vulgar language and some sexual situations.

‽The Bodyguard‽,‽Deep inside the vague, unfocused excesses of "The Bodyguard," the tale of a buttoned-down security agent hired to protect a glamorous pop star, there lurks the potential for a compelling film noir. Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), the bodyguard of the title, could have been a loner in a last-chance profession, terminally alienated from his own past. Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), the glittery singer, could have been drawn tantalizingly as both treacherous vixen and damsel in distress. Rachel could have been dangerously ready to confuse Frank's brand of peace and protection with love. Frank could have fallen, and fallen hard. 
And Rachel's household of hangers-on could have provided a full supply of trouble. On the surface, all her minions -- including a sly publicity agent (Gary Kemp), a senior aide (Bill Cobbs), an oafish security chief (Mike Starr) and a music executive who is also Rachel's sister (Michele Lamar Richards), toady ceaselessly and devote body and soul to insuring Rachel's happiness. But at least one of them also wants her dead. 
As written by Lawrence Kasdan in the mid-1970's, well before his "Body Heat" days, "The Bodyguard" could have capitalized on a mood of mystery and on the dark elements within each principal character. Handled thus, it might have made a lean romantic thriller instead of the long, sprawling semi-travelogue it has become. Mick Jackson, the director of "L.A. Story," has placed the emphasis on the least interesting aspect of this material: the pampered existence of Hollywood royalty, as manifested by countless swimming-pool shots and much attention to grandiose architecture. (The home of William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies is used prominently.) While this is worth something in terms of pure voyeurism, it seldom does much to advance the film's slender story. 
The viewer quickly discovers that Frank Farmer has a tragic flaw: as a Secret Service agent, he was otherwise engaged (actually, at his mother's funeral) on the day President Ronald Reagan was shot and has never forgiven himself for this "lapse." Unaccountably, a sense of failure has led Frank to highly paid work in the private sector, which leaves his Secret Service friends feeling very jealous indeed. 
As the film begins, Frank is hired to guard Rachel, who has received death threats, so he must spend long hours visiting her mansion and watching her concert act. In one such appearance, with Rachel dressed in metal as a kind of Mrs. Ben Hur, Frank becomes so apprehensive about the fans that he uses a fire extinguisher to keep them peaceful. It is from this sort of trumped-up action scene, interspersed with palmy glimpses of Rachel's privileged existence, that the film has been patched together. 
Romantic sparks between Frank and Rachel would have disguised much of the clumsiness, but those sparks are minimal. Sporting the close-cropped haircut he must have had in grade school, Mr. Costner plays Frank in the extremely muted, colorless style that befits Frank's job description. A similar restraint translated wonderfully into slow-burning sexual tension when Mr. Costner appeared in "No Way Out," but this time the effect is more wan. And as Frank, he spends a lot of time looking more watchful than the film's events really warrant. 
Ms. Houston, looking great and displaying the best set of teeth in movies, does better with Rachel's imperious side than with her gentler scenes.  Her character's self-absorption may be lifelike, but it doesn't do much for a love story. Two long hours and 10 minutes after this tale begins, Rachel and Frank seem no closer than seatmates on a long bus trip. It takes a dizzying 360-degree shot of them embracing, plus the swelling of the hit-bound soundtrack, to suggest any passion. 
"The Bodyguard" kills time with some memorably transparent gambits, like a startling leap from Miami to the snows near Lake Tahoe (where Ralph Waite ambles into the film as Frank's father) and a painfully poor facsimile of Academy Awards night.  It also pauses, though only briefly, for a couple of perfunctory love scenes between Rachel and Frank. Unreal as these scenes seem anyhow, they are further undercut by the film's failure even to notice that this is an interracial romance. Strangely enough, "The Bodyguard" comes from Warner Brothers, the studio that just released "Malcolm X." 
The sidelines of "The Bodyguard" are enlivened by Mr. Kasdan's occasionally deft zingers (including the perfect rejoinder to a party pickup line), by moments when Mr. Costner's wariness takes on some dramatic edge and by supporting performances geared to a film noir sensibility. Mr. Kemp, a sinister star of "The Krays," and Ms. Richards are particularly strong reminders of what might have been. 
"The Bodyguard" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes discreet sexual situations, mild profanity and slight violence.

‽Home Alone 2: Lost in New York‽,‽IF "Home Alone 2," the by-the-numbers sequel to the third-biggest hit in movie history, is viewed as a learning experience, its first lesson is that originality is a dangerous thing. Its second, aimed at any child who ever dreamed of drinking Coca-Cola out of a Champagne glass, is that malicious mischief can be construed as no-fault fun. Its third, and most interesting, inadvertent notion is that time does not stand still, no matter how profitable it might be to think otherwise. Between this film and its seemingly very similar predecessor, there is all the difference in the world. 
"Home Alone" became a hit by speaking to secret wishes any child could understand: the desire for independence, the novelty of feeling empowered, the triumph of defending one's castle against invading hordes, or at least against two cartoonish bozos. No one could have predicted that these messages would come through quite so loud and clear, or be presented as so much fun. 
And no one could have suggested, even in an age of slavish sequels, that the formula be replicated outright this time. So "Home Alone" moves to New York City, and does its best both to ignore and exploit this change of scene. But it also changes direction in another way: a film bursting with enthusiasm for a fresh, appealing fantasy has been replaced by one most eager to maintain the status quo. 
This film's only real show of ingenuity comes with its explanation of how Kevin McCallister (of course played by the one-boy box-office phenomenon, Macaulay Culkin) gets to New York in the first place. In establishing this, it actually toys with the audience's expectation of a carbon copy. Once again, the McCallister clan is seen getting ready for a vacation from their outsized suburban dream house, which was a small but significant factor in the first film's fantasy appeal. 
Once again, an alarm clock fails. And once again Kevin is threatened with the possibility of sleeping in the attic, where he was left behind last time. After thus nudging viewers in the ribs, the film makers -- the director Chris Columbus and the writer and mastermind John Hughes -- let Kevin get as far as the airport, where a man wearing clothes like Kevin's father's accidentally leads the boy astray. It takes only a few more wild coincidences to land the film's wide-eyed hero in Manhattan, a setting that is treated by "Home Alone 2" as a holiday gift. It's a long time since a film regarded New York with the wide-eyed, touristy wonder that is evident here. 
The mood is as buoyant as it was the first time, and the story of Kevin's big-city adventures is certainly fun. But there's a difference between watching a previously unknown child actor finagle his way past a grocery clerk and seeing Mr. Culkin, this nation's most stellar little boy, booking himself a hotel suite and a white stretch limousine. The ante is raised when this boy's once-precocious confidence begins to seem like second nature, and when he moves on from the job of defending his parents' house to spending their money. 
A plot twist that has Kevin carrying his father's credit card en route to the airplane expedites the boy's big plans, as does his use of a tape recorder to lower his voice during telephone calls; that's how he makes travel plans. Look for similar tape recorders in toy stores as part of what will surely be the season's second biggest movie-merchandising coup (after "X"), and don't worry about missing the point. Much of "Home Alone 2" takes place in a toy store. 
But this film's home away from home is the Plaza Hotel, plugged so tirelessly that the screenplay works in an 800 number for reservations and a walk-on by Donald Trump. That setting is well used and well populated, thanks to a suspicious hotel staff led by Tim Curry, whose droll disapproval is transformed by Kevin's imagination into a seasonably Grinch-like vision. Rob Schneider and Dana Ivey give the film some lively comic moments by falling for Kevin's stupid-grown-up tricks. 
Those tricks are so similar to the first film's antics that some viewers may blink in disbelief. Again, Kevin tape-records movie dialogue from television and uses it to scare intruders; again, he constructs a dummy that casts an adult-looking silhouette. And again he matches wits, if that is the word, with the two hapless burglars who stalked him last time: Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), the two most birdbrained adult males who ever figured in a little boy's daydream. Once again, Kevin subjects Harry and Marv to terrible tortures in the name of fun. 
But Kevin does not happen to be defending his home this time. Indeed, the setup is so awkward that the boy and his pursuers wind up running from the Plaza to West 95th Street, just so they can play out the film's long-awaited endgame in an empty brownstone. It is here that Kevin throws bricks off the roof onto Marv's forehead, puts a staple through Marv's nose, sets Harry's hair on fire (in a stunt that turns particularly dangerous when Harry soaks his head in a kerosene-filled toilet), inflicts a series of spine-cracking injuries and otherwise works out his aggressive whims. 
Many children will find this funny, and many parents will not. It's much more violent than the first film's comparable set of dirty tricks. And Kevin, removed from his embattled home, seems much more cavalier, possibly even meaner than his bullying older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray). 
"Home Alone 2" may be lazily conceived, but it is staged with a sense of occasion and a lot of holiday cheer. The return of Mr. Culkin in this role is irresistible, even if this utterly natural comic actor has been given little new to do. Mr. Pesci and Mr. Stern bring great gusto to their characters' stupidity, to the point where they are far funnier just walking and talking than they are being hurt. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard give amusing reprises their earlier roles as Kevin's parents, and do some memorable squirming when asked to explain their child-losing mishap to the police. Kieran Culkin, playing Kevin's pesky little brother, is a reminder that this is a family to be reckoned with. And a snowy-haired Eddie Bracken fills much of the film's sentimentality quota as a toy mogul who loves to help sick children. 
The rest of that quota is taken care of by the estimable Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar as the mother in "My Left Foot" and brings surprising grace and stature to the role of a pigeon lady in Central Park. As an echo of the lonely old man played by Roberts Blossom in the first film, this character would be the most shameless element in this one; that is, if bits of John Williams's score didn't sound like "The Nutcracker," too. 
"Home Alone 2" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and considerable violence.

‽
‽Malcolm X‽,‽Malcolm X lived a dozen different lives, each in its way a defining aspect of the black American experience from nightmare to dream. There was never any in-between for the man who was initially called Malcolm Little, the son of a Nebraska preacher, and who, when he died, was known by his Muslim name, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm traveled far, through many incarnations to become as much admired as he was feared as the black liberation movement's most militant spokesman and unrelenting conscience. 
Malcolm was already something of a myth when he was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom in New York on Feb. 21, 1965, just three months short of his 40th birthday. The publication later that year of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," his remarkably vivid testament written with Alex Haley, eventually consolidated his position as a great American folk hero, someone whose life speaks with uncanny pertinence to succeeding generations, white as well as black. 
Taking the autobiography and a screenplay by Arnold Perl that was begun more than 20 years ago (Perl died in 1971), Spike Lee has attempted the impossible and almost brought it off. His new "Malcolm X" is not exactly the equal, or even the equivalent, of the book, but it's an ambitious, tough, seriously considered biographical film that, with honor, eludes easy characterization. 
"Malcolm X" will offend many people for all the wrong reasons. It is neither so inflammatory as Mr. Lee's statements about it would have you believe nor so comforting as might be wished by those who would call a halt to speculation concerning Malcolm's murder. It is full of color and exuberance as it tells of life on the streets in Boston and New York, but it grows increasingly austere when Malcolm is arrested for theft and sent to prison, where he finds his life's mission. The movie becomes proper, well mannered and somber, like Malcolm's dark suits and narrow ties, as it dramatizes his rise in the Nation of Islam, founded by Elijah Muhammad. 
Mr. Lee treats the Nation of Islam and its black separatist teachings seriously and, just as seriously, Malcolm's disillusionment when Elijah Muhammad's fondness for pretty young secretaries is revealed. When, after his split from the Nation of Islam, Malcolm goes on his pilgrimage to Mecca, the film celebrates his new insight into racial brotherhood, which makes his assassination all the more sorrowful. 
In the film's view, a god has been recognized, then lost. 
Mr. Lee means for "Malcolm X" to be an epic, and it is in its concerns and its physical scope. In Denzel Washington it also has a fine actor who does for "Malcolm X" what Ben Kingsley did for "Gandhi." Mr. Washington not only looks the part, but he also has the psychological heft, the intelligence and the reserve to give the film the dramatic excitement that isn't always apparent in the screenplay. 
This isn't a grave fault, nor is it singular. Biographical films, except those about romantic figures long since dead like "Lawrence of Arabia," carry with them responsibilities that tend to inhibit. Mr. Lee has not been inhibited so much as simultaneously awe struck and hard pressed. 
"Malcolm X" is frank about what it sees as the murder conspiracy, which involves a combination of people representing the Nation of Islam and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Yet in trying to cover Malcolm's life from his boyhood to his death, it sometimes seems more breathlessly desperate than cogently revealing. 
The movie picks up Malcolm's story in the 1940's on his arrival in wartime Boston as a bright but square teen-ager from rural Michigan. Malcolm eagerly falls in with the wrong crowd, initially represented by Shorty (Mr. Lee), a street hustler who shows him how to dress (a pearl gray zoot suit) and introduces him to the fast set at the Roseland Ballroom. Malcolm learns how to Lindy and how to wheel and deal. He discovers women and drugs. In addition to his attachment to Laura (Theresa Randle), a sweet young black woman, he develops a far steamier liaison with a thrill-seeking young white woman, Sophia, played by Kate Vernon, who looks a lot like Carroll Baker in her "Baby Doll" days. 
As the film moves forward from the 40's, it suffers spasms of flashbacks to Malcolm's childhood in Nebraska and Michigan. These are so fragmented that they may mean nothing to anyone who hasn't read the autobiography. They also don't do justice to the early experiences themselves, especially to Malcolm's time in a white foster home where he excelled in school and was encouraged by well-meaning adults who did not hesitate to refer to him as a "nigger." 
Mr. Lee is very good in his handling of individual sequences, but until very near the end, "Malcolm X" fails to acquire the momentum that makes everything that happens seem inevitable. The film goes on and on in a kind of reverential narrative monotone. 
The story of Malcolm X is fraught with pitfalls for any movie maker. Mr. Lee is creating a film about a man he admires for an audience that includes those who have a direct interest in the story, those who may not have an interest but know the details intimately and those who know nothing or only parts of the story. It's a tricky situation for anyone committed to both art and historical truth. 
Mr. Lee's method is almost self-effacing. He never appears to stand between the material and the audience. He himself does not preach. There are no carefully inserted speeches designed to tell the audience what it should think. He lets Malcolm speak and act for himself. The moments of confrontational melodrama, something for which Mr. Lee has a particular gift, are quite consciously underplayed. 
In this era of aggressive anti-intellectualism, the film's most controversial subtext might not even be recognized: Malcolm's increasing awareness of the importance of language in his struggle to raise black consciousness. Vaguely articulated feelings aren't enough. Ideas can be expressed only through a command of words. 
Before Mr. Lee came to the "Malcolm X" project, other people had worked on it. In addition to Perl's screenplay, there were adaptations by James Baldwin, David Mamet, Calder Willingham, David Bradley and Charles Fuller. In retrospect, it's easy to see what their difficulties might have been. 
Though the autobiography is full of characters and incidents, they are only peripheral to the larger story of Malcolm's awkward journey toward intellectual and spiritual enlightenment. Then too, Malcolm's life ended before the journey could be said to have been completed. This is not the sort of thing movies accommodate with ease. 
"Malcolm X" never bursts with the free-flowing energy of the director's own fiction, but that's a reflection of the genre, the subject and Mr. Lee's sense of mission. Though the film is being promoted with all sorts of merchandise on the order of T-shirts and baseball caps, the one item that promotes it best is the new book, "By Any Means Necessary: The Trials and Tribulations of the Making of 'Malcolm X,' " by Mr. Lee with Ralph Wiley, published by Hyperion. 
In addition to the screenplay, the book has an extensive report on the research Mr. Lee did before starting the production. Among the people he interviewed was the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, who succeeded Elijah Muhammad as the head of the Nation of Islam. It was apparently a polite encounter, but Mr. Lee remains sharp, skeptical and uninhibited. He's not a reporter to let anyone else have the last word. It's this sort liveliness that is most missed in the film. 
The real triumph of "Malcolm X" is that Mr. Lee was able to make it at all. As photographed by Ernest Dickerson and designed by Wynn Thomas, the movie looks as authentic as any David Lean epic. The large cast of featured players, including Al Freeman Jr., who plays Elijah Muhammad, and Angela Barrett, who plays Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz, is supplemented by, among others, Al Sharpton, Christopher Plummer, Bobby Seale, William Kunstler and Peter Boyle in cameo roles. 
Nelson Mandela, photographed in Soweto, appears at the end to speak a kind of benediction.

‽
‽Bram Stoker's Dracula‽,‽LITTLE did you suspect that the world has been dying for yet another film variation on "Dracula," Bram Stoker's classic of 19th-century gothic fiction. Yet Francis Ford Coppola's new extravaganza, suitably titled "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " to separate it from all others, is such a dizzy tour of movie-making forces that it comes close to overwhelming all reasonable doubts. 
Taking James V. Hart's unusually faithful screen adaptation of the novel, Mr. Coppola has created his own wild dream of a movie, which looks as if it required a special pact with the Treasury Department to finance. With its gorgeous sets and costumes, its hallucinogenic special effects and mad montages that recall the original grandeur of Abel Gance's "Napoleon," this "Dracula" transcends camp to become a testimonial to the glories of film making as an end in itself. 
That's all very well and good, you might say, but shouldn't movies, even Dracula movies, be about something? 
Not necessarily. This "Dracula" is most easily enjoyed if you don't search too hard for meanings, at least for those that go beyond the idea that the Stoker novel is really about Victorian England's fear of unleashed female sexuality. Interpretations can be fun, but they are also misleading. "Nosferatu," F. W. Murnau's unauthorized 1922 adaptation of the Stoker novel, is a silent-screen classic, but it is seen by many to be anti-Semitic. Tod Browning's 1931 "Dracula," starring Bela Lugosi, is about nothing whatsoever. It's watchable today mostly as a footnote to the career of the man who also made "Freaks" and "The Devil Doll." 
Mr. Coppola's version looks like something that he might have imagined nearly 30 years ago, when he wrote and directed his first film, "Dementia 13," a tepid black-and-white horror movie made for about $12 and change. "Dracula" has the nervy enthusiasm of the work of a precocious film student who has magically acquired a master's command of his craft. It's surprising, entertaining and always just a little too much. 
Though set mostly in 1897 London and Transylvania, Mr. Hart's screenplay covers not only what's in the original novel but also what Stoker saw fit to omit. 
This includes the film's vivid precredit sequence in Transylvania shortly after Constaninople's fall to the Turks in 1462. Dracula (Gary Oldman), the bravest knight in all Transylvania, goes mad with grief when his young wife, Elisabeta (Winona Ryder), tricked into suicide by the fiendish Turks, is denied a Christian burial. The young count curses God and stabs the sacred cross, which begins to bleed the first of the buckets of stage blood with which this film is awash. It's never clear just how or why Dracula's vampirism results from this outrage, but dramatic coherence isn't as important as style. 
Mr. Oldman's Dracula comes in all sizes and shapes. When first seen after the opening credits, he is an ancient, bloodless fellow welcoming Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), a young English solicitor who has come to Transylvania to help the old count in his plans to move to London. At another time he is a hairy incubus who ravishes a London society girl in a magnificent Victorian garden in the middle of the night. He also appears as the Devil, as a wolf, as a lizard, as mist. Most important, he turns up as a reincarnated, dandyish version of his younger self. 
That is when he's in London, courting the innocent Mina (Miss Ryder), Jonathan Harker's fiancee, who, by chance, is the reincarnated, long-dead Elisabeta. They meet on a London street in broad daylight. The movie doesn't devote a lot of time to the laws governing vampires and vampirism, but it does point out that the notion that vampires can't stand the light of day is poppycock. It also seems that there are times when a holy cross is of no more use against an attacking vampire than a rolled-up umbrella. 
The narrative of the film, like that of the novel, defies rational synopsis but, in addition to Jonathan, Mina and, of course, the thirsty count, it also involves Mina's best friend, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), an early and quite willing victim of the count in London. She's the sort of Victorian maiden who owns a copy of Sir Richard Francis Burton's privately printed English translation of the "Arabian Nights," unexpurgated and illustrated. 
There's also the brilliant if eccentric Prof. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), the noted vampire specialist, who is called in when it's clear to Lucy's doctor that his patient's failing health is something more than chronic flu. Tom Waits appears as Renfield, the solicitor who goes out to Transylvania before Jonathan and returns quite out of his mind with an insatiable appetite for insects. 
The movie proceeds in the feverish manner of one of Dracula's victims just before he crosses over into the land of the undead. Nights seldom fall that a great storm doesn't erupt. One scene is never completed before another begins, necessitating lots of crosscutting between various simultaneous actions. In this way Mr. Coppola finds equivalents to unhinged minds without ever losing his own. 
When the very proper Jonathan, trying to get some sleep in the castle, is seduced by Dracula's undead brides, they surface up through the mattress, bare-breasted and ravenous. Catching his brides feeding on his guest, Dracula is furious. "That man is mine," he says, luring the women away with the gift of a peasant baby. It's as if Mr. Coppola were saying: "You want a horror film? You got a horror film." 
In the film's most Gance-like montage, covering Dracula's journey to London during yet another storm, the movie crosscuts between Dracula as he changes into some new being, Lucy's being sexually attacked in her garden while Mina watches, and the crazy Renfield in his lunatic asylum. Coherence is beguiled, temporarily anyway. 
The film's most brilliant invention is an eerie sequence set in a London nickelodeon where, don't ask me why, Mina is suddenly stalked by a wolf, which, at Dracula's direction, becomes a docile, loving puppy. It's amazing how long Mr. Coppola can keep this up. 
The principal actors are all fine. Mr. Oldman, Ms. Ryder, Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Reeves and Ms. Frost, a new and very bright-eyed actress, behave with a grace and an affectation that fits the time. The anachronisms are not glaring. Among Mr. Coppola's other colleagues who deserve special mention are Michael Ballhaus, the cinematographer; Thomas Sanders, the production designer, and Eiko Ishioka, who designed the fantastic costumes. 
In a movie of such over-the-top frenzy and opulence, however, performances and people do not stand out as much as the kaleidoscopic results. This movie was imagined, written and directed, then somehow engineered into being as if it were one long, uninterrupted special effect. 
For the most part Mr. Coppola avoids camp humor, though Grand Guignol jokes are in order. "You mean you're going to conduct a post-mortem?" someone says tearfully of a vampire victim, as if to suggest that the victim has already suffered enough. "Not exactly," says Van Helsing. "I just want to cut off the head and take out the heart." 
"Dracula" works well as long as it remains a show. Late in the narrative, possibly to give it some kind of philosophical basis, the director sort of nudges the audience to make analogies between AIDS and vampirism. The film is full of close-ups of horrible things seen so closely that you can't be sure of their exact identity, but there's no doubt about the shots of what are intended to be blood cells. It's not funny. According to the gospel of Bram Stoker, only divine intervention can save Dracula's victims. 
One safer way to interpret "Dracula" is to say that it's about a man disconnected from the world on which he remains dependent. That also has appeared to be the director's problem for some time. After "Apocalypse Now," everything Mr. Coppola touched seemed a bit puny, either light of weight or more technically innovative than emotionally involving. With "Dracula" it's apparent that Mr. Coppola's talent and exuberance survive. 
"Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has lots of blood, violence, female nudity and sexual situations.

‽The Thing Called Love‽,‽''Look out, Music City, 'cause I'm here now, and I ain't never leavin'!'' an aspiring country singer with the potent name of Miranda Presley (Samantha Mathis) whoops into the night from a Nashville rooftop early in ''The Thing Called Love.'' Her exultant shouts distill the optimistic down-home spirit of this cheery but trivial 1993 movie, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, about guitar-toting hopefuls converging on the country music capital at a moment when (thanks to Garth Brooks) the music was enjoying a huge spurt of popularity. 
Watching this mildly engaging, formulaic film, you can imagine how it was pitched as a can't-miss early 90's fusion of ''Nashville'' and ''Urban Cowboy,'' with a sure-fire soundtrack album tie-in. Not only would it revive the director's sagging career, it would be just the vehicle to propel its male lead, River Phoenix, into the stratosphere alongside John Travolta. 
Well, so much for Hollywood fantasies. After ''The Thing Called Love'' fared disappointingly at the box office in some regional dates, it went straight to video. It also turned out to be the last completed feature film for the star, who died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993. Six years later it is having its New York theatrical premiere, today at Anthology Film Archives. 
''The Thing Called Love'' begins promisingly, as Miranda arrives in Nashville by Greyhound from New York just minutes too late to participate in weekly auditions for a Saturday night showcase at the legendary Bluebird Cafe. While hanging around the place, however, she falls in with two other hopefuls, best friends and fellow musicians James Wright (Mr. Phoenix) and Kyle Davidson (Dermot Mulroney), both of whom develop instant crushes on her. 
Miranda also befriends Linda Lue Linden (Sandra Bullock), a marginally talented singer-songwriter who obviously doesn't have what it takes to be a country star. Linda Lue, who eventually decides to enter a local beauty contest, invites Miranda to be her motel roommate. Miranda takes a job as a waitress at the cafe, where she is watched over by its crusty but good-hearted proprietor, Lucy (the country singer K. T. Oslin). 
Although well acted, with early scenes that deftly sketch the atmosphere, the movie, written by Carol Heikkinen, never takes off. Instead of seriously exploring Nashville's music world and concentrating on Miranda's struggle to succeed, the screenplay throws her into a listless triangle with James and Kyle. Since Miranda seems hardheaded and  commonsensical most of the time, her impulsive marriage to the selfish, manipulative James is unconvincing. Meanwhile, Kyle, an inept daredevil prone to injuring himself in showoff stunts, mopes around until an inevitable showdown brings the two friends to blows. The tacked-on feel-good ending is utterly false. 
Mr. Phoenix, who has outgrown his boyish ingenuousness in this film, strikes some sparks as a spoiled, hotheaded rising star whose charm curdles into a glowering sulk the instant he doesn't get his way. But it is finally not a star-making performance. Mr. Phoenix even gets to sing one of his own songs in the film, the  mediocre ''Lone Star State of Mind.'' Somebody was smart enough to realize that such fare could never climb any chart. That's why James's career-launching hit, ''Until Now,'' was written and sung in the movie by someone else, namely Rodney Crowell. 
''The Thing Called Love'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

‽Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould‽,‽In the control room of a recording studio, the engineers discuss the merits of taking cream in their coffee, only half-noticing the enraptured figure behind the soundproof glass. There, Glenn Gould (Colm Feore) begins by casually testing his blood pressure, then listens to a playback of his recording of Bach. To the sounds of the English Suite No. 2, he begins swaying and floating in the throes of esthetic ecstasy, his white shirt billowing in gravity-defying slow motion. Far removed from the engineers' prosaic talk, he seems truly to have passed into another dimension. 
The audience for "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould," a brilliant and transfixing cinematic portrait by Francois Girard, can look forward to enjoying much the same sensation. For an hour and a half, without repeating himself or resorting to tactics that are even slightly familiar, Mr. Girard, whose film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, thoughtfully holds the viewer in thrall. 
Though it glancingly incorporates a great deal of biographical information, this carefully measured film does not choose to describe Gould in ordinary terms. Suffused as it is with the artist's musical sensibility, it doesn't even have to show him playing the piano. Instead, Mr. Girard explores and replicates his subject's eccentric thought processes in a remarkably visceral way, drawing the audience palpably into Gould's state of mind. This film works hypnotically, with great subtlety and grace, in ways that are gratifyingly consistent with Gould's own thoughts about his music and his life. 
Mr. Girard's film is indeed a compilation of 32 glimpses, each of them instantly intelligible, some of them strung together in supremely delicate ways. The format makes dependable sense: this is hardly the first time the variations motif has been brought to bear in describing Gould. More than an homage to his triumphant recordings of Bach's "Goldberg" Variations, this multifaceted structure seems the only possible means of approaching such a complex individual. If it sounds defiantly arty, that suits the subject and his "academic owlishness" (in the words of his biographer Otto Friedrich) perfectly. If it sounds obscure and daunting, it most certainly is not. 
If anything, "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould" should prove even more mesmerizing to those who know little about Gould's life than to those aware that he really did have tastes for ketchup, tranquilizers, arrowroot cookies and Petula Clark (not necessarily in that order).  In its own quirky way, it assembles a surprisingly rigorous and illuminating portrait of the man. Defying any usual constraints of narrative or chronology, Mr. Girard can leap freely from Gould's boyhood to his mature work, from the hotel room to the concert stage, from the raptures of the music to silly questions asked by the press. The individual fragments are so meticulously realized that the whole becomes much greater than the sum of its parts. 
Typically fascinating is "L.A. Concert," a fine example of how cannily Mr. Girard can present the facts of Gould's life. We first see the pianist backstage, poised over a sink, soaking his arms in steaming water five minutes before a concert is to begin.  Pill bottles are conspicuously arrayed in front of him. Called to the stage, he next appears dressed and ready, maintaining a serene detachment as an aide tries to instruct him about the irritating show-business realities of the evening. Just before reaching the stage, he pauses to talk with a stagehand and winds up signing a program for the man. Only when the stagehand examines the autograph does he learn that Mr. Gould has decided to make this 1964 concert performance his last. 
It would be difficult to think of a more adroit, economical way to convey all this information in a such relatively brief time. "Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould," which was written by Mr. Girard with Don McKellar, is also able to fuse the informative with the poetic, particularly in the passages that deal hauntingly with Gould's final days. (He died at 50, in 1982.) One of the film's last images is of a Voyager satellite that went into space carrying aural souvenirs of Earth's culture, including Gould's recording of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier." The film's announcement that the two Voyager spacecraft left our solar system in 1987 and 1989, respectively, suits its lingering impression that Gould was never quite of this world. 
Mr. Feore, a Canadian stage actor, does not overwhelmingly resemble Gould, but he becomes a commanding and believable presence all the same. With a voice that has been made to sound strangely disembodied, and with the ability to project brooding, playful intelligence, Mr. Feore enhances the film's sense of deep mystery. Equally lulling and seductive are Mr. Girard's fluid camera movements, which enable the film to prowl and survey with uncommon ease. In the end, his methods induce a complete and satisfying immersion into his many-faceted subject. 
Among the individual glimpses that must be mentioned here: "Practice," in which Gould resonates to his own thrilling impression of Beethoven's "Tempest" Sonata without ever touching a keyboard; "Truck Stop," in which he hears and seems to orchestrate the voices of people around him; "Personal Ad," in which he toys with the language of the lovelorn, then chuckles at the thought of ever representing himself in that way; "Diary of One Day," a stunning compilation of formulas, medical notations, heartbeats and detailed X-rays of a person playing the piano. Even before the film reaches this last juncture, you will know that the heart and blood of the pianist have been captured on screen. 
Also worth noting: some significant omissions. Mr. Girard knew better than to mention Gould's intense admiration for Barbra Streisand, or to use those sections of the "Goldberg" Variations that have powerfully evoked Dr. Hannibal Lecter ever since they were used to shocking effect in "The Silence of the Lambs." 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould

Haile Gerima's poetic and precisely detailed film takes its audience into its heroine's life and mind as her moral sense is challenged and changed. No viewer can avoid the discomforting questions the film so eloquently raises. 
The opening sequences, set and filmed in Ghana, are alternately seductive and off-putting. Among drums and chants, a voice invokes ancestral ghosts. "Spirit of the dead, rise up," the voice says, "and claim your story." The film's title is a West African term meaning to reclaim the past in order to go forward, and "Sankofa" stumbles only in its depiction of the present. 
Mona is a young model first seen posing for a callous white photographer on a beach. She is dressed in a pseudo-Tina Turner getup complete with blonde wig. This is a heavy-handed way of showing that she has lost her connection to her past, that slavery still shapes her life as she is enslaved by contemporary images. 
But the film soon moves on, convincingly, to a surreal experience. Mona wanders into a dungeon, a holding place from which slaves were shipped to the United States. She has walked into the past, where she is stripped, chained and beaten. Suddenly she is on a plantation, a house slave called Shola, with no memory of Mona or the 20th century. 
The longest and finest part of "Sankofa" is its depiction of the daily life of the slaves and the way witnessing its brutality changes Shola. She falls in love with a rebellious field slave, who urges her to poison her white owners. Shola refuses. Though the master rapes her at will, she believes killing is wrong, no matter what injustice has been done to her. 
But Shola soon sees a pregnant runaway slave beaten to death, her living child taken from her body. And she idolizes Nunu, a strong and motherly slave who has joined the rebels. 
Nunu's son, Joe, is the head slave, who has an easier life and seems to have turned against his own people. He is blue-eyed and in the thrall of the white priest, and his story should have been as compelling as Shola's. But his character is less convincing, partly because his tortured sense of identity is so often depicted by sudden mood swings and glances at paintings of white Madonnas in church. 
Shola, however, (played with great strength by Oyafunmike Ogunlano) carries the audience into the heart of her experience. When she lifts a machete over a sleeping white overseer, the film has led its viewers to a place where either choice -- to kill or not -- might be justified. "Sankofa" asks its audience to enter a different moral universe, one that slavery created. 
Mr. Gerima is an Ethiopian-born film maker who has lived in the United States for decades and teaches at Howard University. His film is ambitious in its depiction of slavery and accomplished in its visual command, from the bright red scarves of the rebellious slaves to a fire they set in the fields. 
"Sankofa" opens today at the Harlem Victoria 5 Theater. Engrossing and provocative, it sends Shola back to the present as Mona, and sends viewers along with her. Armed with visceral new knowledge, she can make of it what she will.

‽Ghost in the Machine‽,‽"Ghost in the Machine" is the kind of movie in which a curling iron, a garbage disposal and a dishwasher become potential murder weapons. The explanation will thrill technophobes: a serial killer dies during a lightning storm and his soul seeps from the hospital's X-ray scanner into a mainframe computer. From there he roams through Ohio's electrical system, ejecting videos from VCR's at will and terrorizing Terry Munroe (Karen Allen) and her 13-year-old son, Josh (Wil Horneff). 
Considering that premise, the film should have been a lot wackier. Although "Ghost in the Machine" opened yesterday without advance screenings (the surest sign of trouble), the movie is not a disaster. It is a competent, occasionally witty genre piece that never tries to be anything more. 
It's no mistake that the story begins with a house that looks suspiciously as if it belongs on Elm Street, and ominous music that suggests Freddy Krueger has come to town. The director is Rachel Talalay, who produced two of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies and directed the last one, "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare." 
"Ghost in the Machine" echoes Freddy's weird ability to creep into supposedly safe places. Here it's the telephone instead of your dreams, but the premise is the same. So is the film's rhythm. Viewers know the computer killer will stike and sometimes even who is up for grabs. (When a sexy teen-age baby sitter appears in "Ghost in the Machine," she's obviously a goner.) The question is when and how, and the best moments in "Ghost in the Machine" have fun playing with that question. Choosing his victims from Terry's address book, the killer first attacks her boss with a lethal microwave that invades the entire kitchen. First the popcorn on the counter pops; then a banana explodes; then the boss's face begins to pop, too. 
The film isn't sharp enough to make its premise seem new, though. It has trouble juggling all the things it tries to be: a special-effects movie filled with computer graphics; a high-tech slasher film; a joke. But its real shortcoming is that it doesn't have the haunting resonance of the "Elm Street" series. A killer who enters dreams is one thing; a killer who plays with the electric swimming-pool cover doesn't have quite the same claim on the unconscious. 
"Ghost in the Machine" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, some of it not computer generated. Ghost in the Machine

‽Batman: Mask of the Phantasm‽,‽"You're harder to kill than a cockroach on steroids," complains the Joker to Batman after a brutal clash from which the Caped Crusader emerges miraculously unscathed. 
"Is my shirt too big or is my flesh crawling?" quips another character in "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm," the movie spinoff of the animated television series. 
"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm," is heavily larded with sarcastic remarks whose tone of 90's cynicism clashes jarringly with the film's sleek 1940's ambiance. That discontinuity is the least of the many problems afflicting the movie, which opened locally on Christmas Day. 
Set in the 1940's, "Mask of the Phantasm" is a cartoon film noir evocation of events that purport to explain the origins of Batman. In convoluted flashbacks, it portrays a star-crossed love affair between Bruce Wayne, the reclusive millionaire who is Batman's alter ego and Andrea Beaumont, a beautiful banker's daughter who suggests a svelte hybrid of Lauren Bacall and Veronica Lake. 
After the violent deaths of Bruce's parents, Andrea's love enables him to give up his vow to avenge the killings. But when she abruptly breaks off their engagement and disappears with her father, the Caped Crusader is born out of the emptiness and disillusionment. In solving a series of murders of aging mobsters, Batman discovers that Andrea and her father are caught up in a web of international loansharking. The killer, with whom Batman does battle, is a sinister caped figure who looks so much like him that he finds himself a prime suspect. 
With its pointed, cavernous backgrounds and a Gotham City setting that evokes a 1940's-style futurism, "Mask of the Phantasm" looks splendid. But its story is too complicated and the editing too jerky for the movie to achieve narrative coherence. And the resemblance between the movie's hero and its enigmatic arch-villain is so close that audiences are likely to be confused. 
The actor's voices may suit animated television characters, but on a large screen Kevin Conroy's Batman, Mark Hamill's Joker, and Dana Delany's Andrea sound flat and one-dimensional. Shirley Walker's overblown score floods the movie with choral bombast that only points up an absence of anything remotely gripping. 
The movie is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has violent scenes.  Batman Mask of the Phantasm  Directed by Eric Radomski and Bruce W.

‽Tombstone‽,‽The Old West has rarely looked as opulent as it does in "Tombstone," the director George P. Cosmatos's retelling of the Wyatt Earp story. In this capacious western with many modern touches, the Arizona boom town and site of the legendary O.K. Corral has a seedy, vaudevillian grandeur that makes it a direct forerunner of Las Vegas. 
The streets may be dusty, but they are very wide. The gambling halls and theaters have a gilt-edged Victorian glamour that contrasts sharply with the shoot-'em-up exuberance of patrons who when roused to enthusiasm are liable to fire their guns into the air. And in time-honored nouveau-riche style, the affluent citizens of a city made rich from silver enjoy dressing to the nines. 
"Tombstone," which opens tomorrow, is as up-to-date in its political consciousness as it is visually spiffy. When Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) arrives in Tombstone from Dodge City, hoping to start a business and live peacefully, he bears the weight heavily of having once killed people in his line of duty as a peace officer. It takes a lot of prodding before he reluctantly pins on a marshal's badge and pursues the cowboy gang that is terrorizing the town. 
That gang of more than 30 is explicitly compared to a modern-day crime syndicate in Kevin Jarre's self-consciously up-to-date screenplay. Led by the evil Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), an outlaw who is described as wanting "revenge for being born," it even includes one Old West homosexual, a character nicknamed "Sister Boy" (Jason Priestley). The screenplay also takes pains to establish the existence of an Asian population in Tombstone that is discriminated against. 
The film has a very contemporary attitude toward alcohol and drug abuse. Although Wyatt's best friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), executes a number of heroic deeds, throughout the film he is a jaundiced, perspiring wreck who is clearly drinking himself to death. Twice during the film, he collapses from what appears to be liver failure and coughs up blood. Wyatt's wife, Mattie (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), who suffers from recurrent headaches, is addicted to laudanum. A wild-eyed wraith, subject to intense mood swings, she is by turns scary and pitiful. 
The movie's most modern psychological touch is its depiction of Josephine (Dana Delany), the itinerant actress with whom Wyatt falls in love at first sight, as the most casually and comfortably liberated woman ever to set foot in 1880's Arizona. In their first conversation, Josephine intimidates Wyatt with philosophical questions like "Are you happy?" and "What do you want out of life?" The only times she is not happy, she says, are those times when she is sexually bored. Wyatt regards her with a respect bordering on awe. Unfortunately, Ms. Delany's bland screen presence doesn't match the flash of her verbal bravado. 
Freighted with all this sociological and psychological baggage, "Tombstone" is really two movies loosely sewn together. One is a conventional western in which Wyatt and his brothers Morgan (Bill Paxton) and Virgil (Sam Elliott) set out to save Tombstone from the clutches of an outlaw gang. The other is a self-consciously digressive meditation on the iconography of the Hollywood western. 
As in Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven," a film that clearly exerted a powerful influence on "Tombstone," the traditional archetypes triumph over modernist conventions. Efficiently directed, with a minimum of audience-teasing suspense, the shootout at the O.K. Corral has a crackling energy and believability. The scene, although short, is very intense and the film's high point. And the confrontations between Wyatt and his team and the forces of malevolent anarchy have a gut-twisting tension. 
Grafted onto this traditional framework, the film's meditative aspects are generally too self-conscious to fit comfortably. Especially when the movie tries to imagine a more enlightened role for women in the Old West, the screenplay begins to strain. 
"Tombstone" goes to great lengths to portray Doc as a prefigurement of a dissolute modern poet, a frontier-era Jim Morrison. In one scene, the character flourishes Latin phrases. In another, he bangs out part of a Chopin nocturne on an out-of-tune piano. Mr. Kilmer, who gave an uncanny impersonation of Morrison in "The Doors," can be terrific at this sort of thing. But in "Tombstone," a performance that aims to chew all the scenery in sight seems slightly mannered. 
Mr. Russell's clear, steady portrayal of Wyatt Earp gives the film a core of emotional integrity. While he doesn't project the mythic heroic stature of a Wayne or an Eastwood, he conveys the dignified rectitude of someone who has seen more than he wishes of the world's evil and still believes that civility can prevail over chaos. As he faces two moral crises -- one involving violence and the other love -- you can almost feel the wheels in his mind turning as he decides what to do. 
If Wyatt Earp's decision to meet violence with violence accords with classic Western tradition, his cautiously allowing himself to love Josephine, while still married, belongs to a different moral universe. It's a measure of Mr. Russell's thoughtful, understated performance that this decision carries real weight. 
"Tombstone" is, finally, a movie that wants to have it both ways. It wants to be at once traditional and morally ambiguous. The two visions don't quite harmonize. 
"Tombstone" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, violence and a fair amount of gore.

‽Grumpy Old Men‽,‽"Grumpy Old Men" is the kind of holiday movie a lot of people are searching for. It's cheerful, it's well under two hours and it doesn't concern any major social blights, unless you think Jack Lemmon tossing a dead fish into Walter Matthau's car is cause for alarm. 
Those rare qualities might make the film, which opens tomorrow, one of the season's more entertaining simply by default. What gives it a jolt in its own right is that Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau have only got wilier in the years since "The Odd Couple." They can do wonders even with this middling material about two neighbors in their late 60's, lifelong friends who express their affection by pretending to hate each other. 
The title may be generic and the setting an icy Minnesota town, but these grumps are positively related to Oscar and Felix. Mr. Matthau plays Max Goodman, the more slovenly of the two. A divorced former television repairman, Max seems to have an endless wardrobe of plaid hunting caps with earflaps. Mr. Lemmon plays John Gustafson, a widowed former history teacher who now spends a fair amount of time climbing out his second-story window and down a ladder to escape an I.R.S. investigator (Buck Henry). 
The supposed feud between the men has been going on for so long -- more than 50 years -- that only they can remember why it started. What's clear is that playing practical jokes and tolerating each other's presence has become their shared retirement hobby, along with fiercely competitive ice fishing. 
Just don't expect their bickering to be on the level of Neil Simon, and you won't be disappointed. The lines here include "Morning, moron," a greeting Mr. Lemmon conveys with acid conviction. Mr. Matthau drawls out "Eat my shorts" as if Max thinks he has invented a clever new insult. 
These men are not warmed-up caricatures of Felix and Oscar, but blood brothers who have got older without figuring out what to do with their empty retirements. One solution suddenly zooms into the neighborhood on a snowmobile. Ann-Margret plays Max and John's new neighbor, a middle-aged widow who gives them someone new to fight over. She is an artist and teacher transplanted from California, which gives her a mild, refreshing hint of spaciness. Max and John's cautious and rusty attempts at flirting and dating are funny without being condescending. 
Audiences have come to expect that every time Mr. Matthau raises an eyebrow it will be a perfect comic gesture, and his record is intact. But it is Mr. Lemmon who is especially engaging. After a string of high-pitched dramatic roles that seemed calculated to reach Oscar voters ("Glengarry Glen Ross" and "Short Cuts"), he is at ease and restrained here. He can pile up dramatic awards, but the light comic flair that shines through in "Some Like It Hot" and "Mr. Roberts" is still the best side of him. 
Donald Petrie, the director of "Mystic Pizza," shows the same sureness and affection for small-town life and characters here. Kevin Pollak as Max's son and Daryl Hannah as John's daughter both seem bemused by their parents and simply by being in this film. Ossie Davis has a small, crafty role as Max and John's friend. Only Burgess Meredith is forced into a foolish part as John's ninetysomething father, who smokes, drinks, fantasizes about women and calls his son a kid. He is a geezer, the sort of cliche that "Grumpy Old Men" otherwise avoids. 
Mr. Matthau and Mr. Lemmon may be familiar in these roles, but their characters are not really old or stale. And they're just grumpy enough. 
"Grumpy Old Men" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some strong language. Grumpy Old Men  Directed by Donald Petrie; written by Mark Steven Johnson; director of photography, John E. Jensen; edited by Bonnie Koehler; music by Alan Silvestri; production designer, David Chapman; produced by John Davis and Richard C. Berman; released by Warner Brothers. Running time: 105 minutes.

‽The Accompanist‽,‽Romane Bohringer is about to create a stir. This plain, baleful-looking young French actress will soon be seen in two very different films, including Cyril Collard's "Savage Nights," which was shown at this year's New Directors/New Films festival and is to begin its commercial run early next year. Her Cesar-winning performance in that film, as the wild, rebellious teen-age girlfriend of a man with AIDS, could not be less like her demure title role in "The Accompanist," the urbane new film by Claude Miller opening today at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas. 
Both performances reveal Miss Bohringer as a demanding, furiously intense screen presence, someone who can behave quite passively and still take up all the oxygen in a room. She has a raw, desperate quality that seems doubly startling against the sophisticated context of "The Accompanist," in which a veneer of elegance shields the principals from most forms of rude reality. 
Beginning late in 1942 in occupied France, "The Accompanist" devotes center stage to Irene Brice (Elena Safonova), a ravishing singer who is a great favorite with the Vichy set. But the glum, silent young woman by Irene's side commands a different kind of attention. Originally hired as a pianist for Irene's rehearsal sessions, Sophie Vasseur (Miss Bohringer) soon becomes a fixture in Irene's household. Cautious and watchful, well attuned to all the nuances of Irene's professional and romantic lives, Sophie glories in her employer's triumphs while wondering when her own moment in the spotlight will come. 
"The Accompanist," adapted by Mr. Miller and Luc Beraud from a novel by Nina Berberova, would be more like "All About Eve" if it were made with anything bolder than Mr. Miller's smoothly contemplative sensibility. As it is, Sophie's Eve Harrington thoughts remain unspoken, delivered to the audience in voice-over while Ms. Bohringer gazes dutifully at Ms. Safonova's lovely Irene. For all her silent frustration, Sophie cannot settle the question of just how actively she ought to assert herself. Her inaction can be seen in wider terms, given the wartime setting and France's larger paralysis during the German occupation. 
The third principal in "The Accompanist" is Charles Brice, Irene's husband, a businessman (played by Richard Bohringer, Romane's father). Rich and successful, determined to stay that way, the feisty Charles is sustained by Irene's glamorous career just as surely Sophie is. Charles is the film's most volatile character, the one who goes from idly dropping Marshal Petain's name to realizing it is time to pack the Vuitton luggage and personally carry it over the Pyrenees. 
Charles is also the story's main victim, being no match for either Sophie's silences or Irene's treacherous wiles. "Is being a woman so difficult?" he finally asks Sophie, who has become everybody's confidante.  "Yes, I think so," she answers, very much in earnest. Having studied Irene's travails and betrayals so intimately, Sophie knows whereof she speaks. 
Although Mr. Miller (whose earlier films include the 1981 "Garde a Vue") divides "The Accompanist" informally into three sections, one devoted to each of the main characters, it is Sophie who quietly burns a hole in the screen. Catapulted from the deprivation of wartime life to the sumptuousness of Irene's sheltered existence, Sophie quite literally swoons; soon afterward, her first experience of a grand late-night dinner with Irene's admirers makes her physically ill. The film is most striking in watching Ms. Bohringer subtly absorb the lessons of Irene's world and try, not always successfully, to make them her own. 
"The Accompanist" is fashionably open-ended in describing this process. Life is said to be passing Sophie by as the film begins, and it is still passing her by when the story is over. A contrived shipboard romance, as Sophie and the Brices flee to England, is never as affecting or credible as it's meant to be, but "The Accompanist" is not the sort of film that is watched for plot. Its chief pleasures are atmospheric, thanks to the keenly observed details of Irene's cosseted existence and the cascade of beautiful music that makes up the score. 
The soundtrack incorporates selections by Mozart, Strauss, Berlioz, Schumann and numerous others, making this one more recent French film (along with "Un Coeur en Hiver" and "Tous les Matins du Monde") in which music supplies an extra dimension of sensual delight. The audience will be as overwhelmed by Irene's recitals (with voice supplied by Laurence Monteyrol) as Sophie is herself, as the music combines with the imagery of this radiant, alluring singer draped in white satin and flanked by flowers. 
The film, which has its denouement in an English pub called the Angel, takes Sophie well beyond the surface of Irene's glamour. But the memory of Irene's music stays with her protegee long after the bloom is off the rose. It will stay with the audience, too. 
"The Accompanist" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes brief nudity and implicitly sexual situations. The Accompanist Directed by Claude Miller; written by Mr. Miller and Luc Beraud, based on the novel by Nina Berberova, in French with English subtitles; director of photography, Yves Angelo; edited by Albert Jurgenson; music by Alain Jomy; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

‽
‽The Summer House‽,‽"The Summer House" might as well be called "The Jeanne Moreau Show." Like a television series tailored to the image of its star, this small-scale English movie presents the actress as a flamboyant, exotic and cynical woman with a rich sexual past. Her supposed function in the story is to save an unhappy young woman named Margaret from a disastrous marriage to her next-door neighbor, a 40-year-old twit who still lives with his mother. But her real purpose is to swoop through the film being Jeanne Moreau, in a performance that is over the top and tremendous fun to watch. She doesn't ever wink at the camera, but she and the audience know exactly what she is up to. 
Margaret (Lena Headey, who plays the rosy-cheeked housemaid in "The Remains of the Day") begins the film with an ominous dream about her recent trip to Egypt. The dream includes a young man and a bloody dagger, and hints at some disturbing reason why she has agreed to marry the dunderheaded neighbor, Syl (David Threlfall). 
Of course, the setting is 1959, when a girl wouldn't want to be "left on the shelf," as Margaret's drab mother, Monica, puts it. (Julie Walters is unrecognizably prim and gray as Monica.) But that is a trifling excuse here; the film is so contemporary in its freewheeling attitude toward sex and marriage that Monica's attitudes seem as frumpy as her clothes. 
Even Syl's widowed mother, played with incomparable wit by Joan Plowright, can see that Margaret loathes her fiance. And from the moment Monica's girlhood friend Lili (Ms. Moreau) arrives for the wedding, the question is how she will save Margaret from a fate worse than spinsterhood. 
The answer is not hard to guess. The issue is a delaying tactic that allows Lili to possess the screen. She is half-Egyptian and half-English, with bright orange-red hair. She trails multicolored scarves and is loaded down with enormous Egyptian rings and necklaces. She delivers her droll lines with a world-weary wisdom that has been nearly patented by Ms. Moreau. "I wonder if he wears lace panties," Lili casually wonders about Syl while she and Margaret walk to the butcher's. "Egyptian men don't as a rule, but the English are a breed apart." 
Joan Plowright is one of the few actresses confident and smart enough to realize that the only way to steal a scene from Jeanne Moreau is to claim the opposite camp. Looking totally unglamorous and underplaying in the extreme, she is every bit her co-star's match. 
When Ms. Plowright first appears as Mrs. Monro she is sitting in bed wearing a white nightcap, resembling Little Red Riding Hood's granny. Eventually she and Lili develop a friendship, and in one scene they go to a pub where they become falling-down drunk and honest. It has been easy for Mrs. Monro to forgive Lili for a long-ago affair with her husband; as she admits, she is quite a bit happier as a widow. "I look forward to it," Lili says, efficiently dismissing her artist-husband (John Wood). 
Mrs. Monro also has the perfect response to her friend's portentous remarks. "Oh, Lili, that makes no sense," she says, "but I believe you." 
The director, Waris Hussein, was wise to let these two actresses run away with the movie. The screenplay is at times too whimsical and at times too slight. When Lili pulls off her ultimate trick, in the garden house of the title, it hints at a darkness in her character that has been suggested but not developed. And it was hardly necessary to make all the men unfaithful idiots. 
But it would be too bad if this charming film were lost among the season's big commercial movies. Acting together in top form, Ms. Moreau and Ms. Plowright are something to see. The Summer House Directed by Waris Hussein; written by Martin Sherman, based on the novel "The Clothes in the Wardrobe," by Alice Thomas Ellis; director of photography, Rex Maidment; edited by Ken Pearce; music by Stanley Myers; production designer, Stuart Walker; produced by Norma Heyman; released by the Samuel Goldwyn Company.

‽
‽Wrestling Ernest Hemingway‽,‽"Wrestling Ernest Hemingway" begins with the camera looking down at Richard Harris, as a man in his 70's, naked on the floor doing push-ups. This is not the most flattering angle from which the actor has ever been shot, which is very much the point. The film, which follows the growing friendship of two aging men who have nothing in common but loneliness, means to do something radical, at least by Hollywood standards: it tells the demographically unpopular tale of old people. 
But the self-conscious bravado of the opening scene also suggests the film's overwhelming weakness. Instead of simply assuming that the old have interesting lives, the film never stops congratulating itself for being daring enough to focus on them. It shows the terrible strain of trying too hard. 
The story belongs to Mr. Harris, as Frank, once a daring sea captain and now a loud, hard-drinking retiree who has been divorced four times. He has lived so wildly that he actually wrestled Hemingway in Puerto Rico in 1938, or so he claims. He flirts with Piper Laurie, as a proud and proper woman he meets at the movies. He argues with Shirley MacLaine, as the weary owner of the rundown apartment house to which he has just moved. 
Mr. Harris's over-the-top performance suits his character, whose Hemingway story suggests the escapist myths by which he has lived. The character is helped by the film's exact use of detail. Frank takes a bottle and a Hemingway book to the park. He wears bright orange shorts, is grizzled and unshaven. It is not upsetting to see Mr. Harris looking old here, but it is extremely disconcerting to realize how much he has come to resemble George Carlin. 
Robert Duvall plays Walter, a fussy Cuban bachelor and one-time barber who also lives in the fictional Florida town of Sweetwater. The cautious Walter goes to the same restaurant every day and always gets two bacon sandwiches (one for breakfast, one to keep for lunch), mainly so he can continue a sweet friendship with a young waitress (Sandra Bullock, from "Demolition Man"). Mr. Duvall's restraint suits his character as well, but he is saddled with a Cuban accent that calls attention to the film's many contrivances. Here are two intelligent but distant performances, which make it impossible to forget that we are watching Richard Harris and Robert Duvall acting old. 
The three actresses are appealing, but their roles are understandably tiny. This is a story about male bonding, geriatric style. When Frank forces his friendship on Walter, the pattern is instantly predictable: Walter's resistance, the inevitable closeness, the explosive argument in the street. Frank and Walter are like "The Odd Couple" without the jokes. 
But the film, which opens today at the First and 62d Cinemas, also offers scenes that are generous and genuine. Among this season's many overlong movies, this is the one, running 2 hours and 3 minutes, that would have benefitted most from losing a half-hour. There is a finer movie hidden inside the scenery chewing and predictability. 
Among the most eloquent touches is the wordless image of Walter, viewed from outside his apartment window, dressed in a suit and tie and dancing quite debonairly by himself, an imaginary woman in his arms. 
And an episode between Mr. Harris and Ms. MacLaine is exceptionally poignant. Frank drunkenly goes to his landlady's apartment late at night. He desperately wants to sleep with her; she is guarded and self-protective, but may be as lonely as he is. It is heartbreaking to hear Frank admit, "I can't do this anymore." He is talking not only about this physical moment, but also about his desperately isolated life. 
The director, Randa Haines, is best known for her feature films "Children of a Lesser God" and "The Doctor." But her strongest work was the tough, made-for-television movie about incest, "Something About Amelia." As in her other features, "Wrestling Ernest" too often gives in to an easy, sentimental impulse, creating the kind of scene in which Frank and Walter urinate in the ocean while fireworks explode in the background. Mr. Macho Hemingway would have felt right at home using the ocean as a toilet, but what would he have made of those fancy fireworks? 
"Wrestling Ernest Hemingway" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes strong language and a glimpse of nudity.

‽The Pelican Brief‽,‽MILLIONS of people have already seen "The Pelican Brief," though it is only now opening at neighborhood theaters. That's because John Grisham's novel is written as instant movie material. It has a big secret; it has a big explosion; it has a conspiracy plot that leads all the way to the top. It has a heroine who sounds exactly like Julia Roberts, if Julia Roberts were going to law school. Mr. Grisham has even incorporated lots of New Orleans and Washington scenery, thus giving his intrigue plot some extra tourist appeal. 
Mr. Grisham, a fixture at the top of the best-seller list and the most cinematic popular author this side of Michael Crichton, habitually writes half-books. The opening setups are what sell his stories, even if they disintegrate into empty skullduggery and endings that are conspicuously weak. It helps that his prose is crisp and streamlined enough to persuade the reader that something substantial is afoot, even when there are strong indications to the contrary. At best, a Grisham book offers a veneer of seriousness and a strong jolt of clever escapism. Food for thought it's not. 
As written and directed by Alan J. Pakula with all the glossy professionalism he can muster, the film version of "The Pelican Brief" has much the same tenor. It is, in fact, the closest thing to an exact transcription of Mr. Grisham's novel as might have been imagined, to the point where the author's devoted readers will experience strong deja vu. 
The story, neatly compressed, unfolds in dependable and photogenic ways. And it is coaxed along by Mr. Pakula's considerable skills as a brisk, methodical film maker. It could be shorter, and it could be more imaginative. (Sydney Pollack's superior Grisham adaptation, "The Firm," really did breathe life into the author's paper-thin characters.) But as a fast-moving, good-looking visual replica of an intrigue potboiler, it also could have been a lot worse. 
"The Pelican Brief" is best watched as a celebration of liquid brown eyes and serious star quality, thanks to the casting of Ms. Roberts and Denzel Washington in its leading roles. Neither of these first-rate actors is shown to great dramatic advantage, but they both do a lot to make the movie shine. 
Ms. Roberts is cast as Darby Shaw, a brilliant law student who becomes the Nancy Drew of the 90's. And Mr. Washington plays Gray Grantham, the brilliant black newspaper reporter who was white in Mr. Grisham's novel. Mr. Grisham didn't actually write an ending, but he did close his book with a clinch and a promise of romance between Darby and Gray. The film, which thrives on the comfortable chemistry between its two stars, isn't quite gutsy or colorblind enough to do the same. 
The premise, in short: two Supreme Court Justices are assassinated, and a feisty Tulane University Law School student wants to know why. Encouraged by her professor, Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepard, who is also her lover), Darby does some research. Amazingly, she digs up something very, very pertinent to the assassinations, and she nicknames her written report the Pelican Brief. Callahan casually turns this brief over to an F.B.I. friend (John Heard), to whom he boasts about Darby. "Here, take a look at it," Callahan says. "You'd get a kick out of how her mind works." 
Kick, eh? Callahan soon receives a kick of his own, and then Darby is off and running. Viewers and/or readers are asked to believe that this lone, gorgeous law student has stumbled onto the power to bring down people in high places, and that skilled assassins are stalking her every move. To the rescue: Gray Grantham, journalist, whom Darby first gets in touch with by telephone, calling herself Alice. Gray scribbles on his notepad while they talk. "Name not Alice?" Gray writes. Gray is supposed to be a star reporter. 
As the film piles on shovelfuls of further exposition, Mr. Washington and Ms. Roberts are left to look terrific and recite perfunctory lines. She (for instance): "How can you be so sure?" Or he (authoritatively): "Darby, if this thing reaches as deep and goes as high as we think it does, these men will do anything not to be exposed." It's a shame that Ms. Roberts is relegated to looking worried most of the time, but even in a by-the-numbers role she manages to glow. During a hiatus from screen acting, she has spent time becoming even more drop-dead beautiful and a shade more self-possessed. 
Also seen to good advantage in Mr. Pakula's cleverly cast film are Tony Goldwyn as the nice young man who effectively runs the country, and Robert Culp as the President who very clearly doesn't. Mr. Culp, seen avidly training his dog in the Oval Office, gives the film one of its rare flashes of wit. The supporting cast also includes William Atherton as the instantly fishy director of the C.I.A., and John Lithgow as the blustery, suspender-wearing newspaper editor who refers to the author of the Pelican Brief as "Bird Girl." 
As photographed by Stephen Goldblatt, "The Pelican Brief" looks picturesque whether it is dawdling in New Orleans's French Quarter or at Mount Vernon. Mr. Pakula's screenplay does a heroic job of cramming in information and keeping the characters in motion. But it never answers the story's most nagging question: Why don't the assassins simply ambush Darby on a shopping trip? She goes into hiding with only the dress she is wearing, then manages a number of nice costume changes throughout the rest of the film.  "The Pelican Brief" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, most of it discreetly staged. The Pelican Brief  Directed by Alan J. Pakula; written by Mr. Pakula, based on the novel by John Grisham; director of photography, Stephen Goldblatt; edited by Tom Rolf and Trudy Ship; music by James Horner; production designer, Philip Rosenberg; produced by Mr. Pakula and Pieter Jan Brugge; released by Warner Brothers.

‽Beethoven's 2nd‽,‽Anyone making a dog movie could do much worse than to borrow the plot of "101 Dalmatians." "Beethoven's 2d" may be the sequel to last year's hit about a lovable, sloppy St. Bernard adopted by a suburban family, but it is also a lively and sweetly told story of puppy-napping. 
Now a beloved member of the Newton family, Beethoven sows a few wild oats with another St. Bernard named Missy. She's the one with the pink bow between her ears. Missy is also a pawn in an ugly divorce. The wife, Regina, takes her away from her kindly owner, and threatens to hold her until she gets money. And when she discovers the four puppies born to Missy and Beethoven, she threatens to take them as well. Fortunately, the younger Newton children, 13-year-old Ted and 9-year-old Emily, escape with the pups and hide them in the basement. They remember how long it took their father, Charles Grodin, to learn to love Beethoven in the original movie. 
The comic villains are never much of a threat to Beethoven's family. With her swooping eyebrows, Regina (Debi Mazar) is a fair match for Cruella De Vil. She does everything short of threaten to turn the puppies into a coat. "Drown 'em," she whines. Her partner, Floyd (Chris Penn), a man too stupid to eat with his mouth shut. 
As in the first "Beethoven," Mr. Grodin holds the film together. He is the most soothing and protective dad since Pongo, the original Dalmatian. He is one of the few comic actors who can hold his own with a dog, without mugging it up, and is especially game when he and Beethoven are entered in a burger-eating contest. 
"Beethoven's 2d" will be irresistible to children, but it doesn't have the crossover appeal that allowed the original to be entertaining for adults as well. And it has three long musical montages that may drag for everybody. In two of them, James Ingram and Dolly Parton sing "The Day I Fall in Love." At least it's not called "The Love Theme From Beethoven," though Beethoven and Missy do look soulfully into each other's eyes. 
The relative tameness of "Bethoven's 2d" may come from the change in directors. The original was directed by Ivan Reitman, of "Ghostbusters," "Twins" and "Dave" fame. The sequel is directed by Rod Daniel, who directed the James Belushi flop "K-9." But he does have a way with dogs. He makes the Beethoven family seem adorable, even to those of us capable of imagining a St. Bernard coat. 
"Beethoven's 2d" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some drunken teen-agers, who learn that drinking doesn't pay. Beethoven's 2d  Directed by Rod Daniel; written by Len Blum; director of photography, Bill Butler; edited by Sheldon Kahn and William D. Gordean; music by Randy Edelman; production designer, Lawrence Miller; produced by Michael C. Gross and Joe Medjuck; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 87 minutes. This film is rated PG.

‽Wayne's World 2‽,‽Time has caught up with Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey), even if it hasn't actually made them any smarter. In "Wayne's World 2," they begin to feel a strange aging sensation, "like I'm in a John Hughes rite du passage movie," as Wayne grandly describes it. Spurred on by this, Wayne begins searching for the meaning of his life. He finds it through the help of Jim Morrison, who appears to him in a dream. According to the film, Jim Morrison spends his time with Sammy Davis Jr. when he isn't busy giving Wayne advice. 
"Wayne's World 2," a very good-humored sequel for anyone in tune with its subject, sends Wayne and Garth back through the mists of rock-and-roll history at Morrison's suggestion. He has advised them to stage Waynestock, a retro-style outdoor rock concert. This is terribly confusing for Garth, who always thought the peace sign and the Mercedes-Benz logo were identical. Even more bewilderingly, Wayne and Garth stumble across ancient rock artifacts as they try to plan the show. Showing a worn old "Frampton Comes Alive" LP to his girlfriend, Cassandra (Tia Carrere), Wayne explains: "If you lived in the suburbs, you were issued it. It came in the mail with samples of Tide." 
Studying a Gerry and the Pacemakers record, Wayne muses: "You know, I bet those guys actually have pacemakers by now." The audience that finds this funny will also know why Wayne and Garth make their road crew practice straightening out a toppled microphone while being pelted by a tennis-ball-serving machine. This is a perfect way of simulating the refined atmosphere to which Waynestock aspires. 
It should be noted that neither this film nor the original "Wayne's World" aims much higher than that, and that both have been carefully calibrated as home video-style comedies. It barely matters whether the gags here have any bearing on each other, as long as they fly by quickly; these films' disjointed, grab-bag humor works best at its most absurd. So a ridiculous martial arts interlude between Wayne and Cassandra's father (James Hong) becomes droll because its audio is dubbed into English, and because the same loud noises that indicate mighty blows also accompany a phone call. A brief sequence bringing the story to London is funny because Wayne and Garth make it clear Paramount wouldn't pay to send them there. 
"Wayne's World 2," which also includes a few movie parodies of uneven cleverness, spends a lot of time winking at its audience in similar ways. Calling attention to its own artifice whenever possible, the film finds its craftiest silliness in Wayne and Garth themselves. Mr. Myers, and particularly the sly Mr. Carvey, still breathe life into these lovable burnouts, who manage to be innocents abroad even in the privacy of their own homes. This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film's gags. But the formula isn't tired yet. 
Particularly entertaining this time is Ralph Brown as a venerable English roadie who delivers several shades of "Spinal Tap"; sorting the M &amp; M's by color was once an important part of his job, and he never tires of telling the same name-dropping stories to unsuspecting listeners. Also on hand is Aerosmith, the Dorian Gray of rock bands, to serve the same purpose Alice Cooper did in the first film. If you were Wayne or Garth, you could spend time wondering what Aerosmith's importance here has to do with "Dazed and Confused," in which Aerosmith is also conspicuously mentioned. 
Also appearing, in brief cameos, are Charlton Heston, Drew Barrymore and Rip Taylor, who delivers the definitive assessment of Jim Morrison's vocal style. ("He's a god in my country," the Hong Kong-born Cassandra says breathlessly of Mr. Taylor.) Kim Basinger is a lot foxier than funny as the woman who does her utmost to seduce Garth. ("Can I have some cocoa later?" he wants to know.) Christopher Walken, sleek and sinister as ever, has the role of the record producer who promises to further Cassandra's tiresome career.  It comes as a relief that Cassandra, an aspiring rock vocalist and successful trash-flash fashion plate, does not have a chance to sing this time. 
As directed by Stephen Surjik and written by Mr. Myers with Bonnie Turner and Terry Turner, "Wayne's World 2" keeps the franchise alive in ways that may eventually prove quite scary. After all, as the mixed-up English roadie points out, it's not as if the Grateful Dead were still together any more, is it? Wayne and Garth just might outlast them all. 
"Wayne's World 2" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and sexual situations.

‽Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit‽,‽Whoopi Goldberg must have an evil twin. The bad twin is the one who can't stay out of the tabloids, one day being happily roasted with racial jokes at the Friars Club and the next offering a cookbook recipe for "Jewish American Princess Fried Chicken." She may be tasteless but at least she's interesting. It's the good twin who surfaces in "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit," and she's pretty much a snooze. 
Ms. Goldberg's brash persona brought a whiff of mischief to the original "Sister Act," in which she played a mediocre lounge singer, Deloris Van Cartier, forced to masquerade as Sister Mary Clarence. There was plenty of sentimental uplift at the end, but throughout Ms. Goldberg made it clear that a convent was the last place Deloris's married, mobster boyfriend would find her. 
The sequel suffers from a lame, saccharine premise and a fatally earnest manner. This time, Deloris is called back by her old convent cohorts when they can't get through to their streetwise high-school students. "Help us by becoming a teacher," implores Maggie Smith as Mother Superior. Before long Mary Clarence is entering her music class in a statewide choral competition and along the way saving the troubled school from becoming a parking lot. 
Now Ms. Goldberg looks comfortable wearing a habit; no more penguin jokes for her. There is no irreverence here, and no sense of what street kids are like. Sister Mary Clarence's supposedly belligerent students act out by putting glue on her chair. (In real life wouldn't they just pull their guns on her?) 
And if the movie seems muddled about high school, it is hopeless about music. The original "Sister Act" counted on hokey but catchy adaptations of girl-group songs. The sequel whizzes through a bit of everything from gospel to Motown to the tamest versions of rap ever recorded (they're like rap lite). The movie may not intend to be creaky and condescending, but it flirts with the idea that rap is the devil's music. 
Bill Duke, who has directed much smarter films ("A Rage in Harlem") as well as the syrupy Disney movie "The Cemetery Club," is less at fault than the Up With People script. The returning nuns have little to do except walk through smaller versions of their old roles: Kathy Najimy is still the bubbly Sister Mary Patrick, Mary Wickes the tough Sister Mary Lazarus, and Wendy Makenna the meek Sister Mary Robert. Three fine character actors -- Barnard Hughes, Michael Jeter and Brad Sullivan -- are wasted as priests. And though Ms. Goldberg was reportedly paid $7 million to make this movie, she seems curiously low on energy, even when doing a James Brown impression. 
The best part of "Sister Act 2" is the closing credits. The nuns bop around singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" and the priests are photographed from above while they lie on the floor doing a Busby Berkeley dance routine. Only then does this sequel hint at the gentle, entertaining satire of the original. 
There is one conspicuous missed opportunity. Early on, the school's misinformed headmaster tells Sister Mary Clarence what he has heard: "Your last posting was at a women's prison in the Louisiana bayou." Now that is a premise with possibilities. 
"Sister Act 2" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes a mild expletive.

‽The Hawk‽,‽"The Hawk" is a small, efficient English thriller that plays off the question: How well do you know the people closest to you? Helen Mirren plays a suburban housewife named Annie, who begins to suspect that her husband, Stephen, is a serial killer called the Hawk. Stephen always happens to be traveling on business when the Hawk strikes; the murder weapon is a hammer, possibly like the one Annie can't find around the house; worst of all, the Hawk preys on women with two children, just like Annie. 
Ms. Mirren is the centerpiece of the film, in a role that might be the reverse image of her best-known part, Inspector Jane Tennison on the television series "Prime Suspect." Instead of playing a fiercely confident detective, here she is a befuddled woman trying to be strong: tortured by doubts, short on self-esteem, stuck in a bad marriage. In one smartly detailed and affecting scene, when Annie goes out to dinner she dresses garishly wrong and is humiliated by her drunken husband. 
"The Hawk," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is best when it stays close to Annie's self-doubts and growing fears. Ms. Mirren creates a character so sympathetic that her worst nightmares seem plausible. She keeps the audience weighing evidence and wondering along with her: Is Stephen a killer or just a louse? And why does his brother give everyone the creeps? 
The film turns weaker and too tricked up when it drags in Annie's history of depression, which allows Stephen (George Costigan) and his interfering mother (Rosemary Leach) to discredit her suspicions. By then the audience knows that while Annie might be wrong, she's not stupid or delusional. 
Though the film redeems itself with a couple of surprise twists, it is not as taut or inventive as it needs to be. The director, David Hayman, has a penchant for ominous music, but he creates a clear, steady vision that reflects his level-headed heroine. "The Hawk" is not as gripping as "Prime Suspect," but it passes easily as a weaker cousin. 
"The Hawk" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence and some graphic views of corpses. The Hawk  Directed by David Hayman; written by Peter Ransley, based on his novel; director of photography, Andrew Dunn; edited by Justin Krish; music by Nick Bicat; production designer, David Myerscough-Jones; produced by Ann Wingate and Eileen Quinn; released by Castle Hill.

‽Geronimo: An American Legend‽,‽"A powerful stocky warrior with a perpetual scowl on his face, Geronimo personified all that was savage and cruel in the Apache," states Robert M. Utley's introduction to a recent edition of "The Truth About Geronimo," written by Britton Davis in 1929. "Few whites who knew him had much praise for him, and most of his own people feared and disliked him. Davis characterized him as 'a thoroughly vicious, intractable and treacherous man. His only redeeming traits were courage and determination. His word, no matter how earnestly pledged, was worthless.' History has supported this judgment." 
Obviously, times have changed. The revisionist view of Geronimo is apparent in "Geronimo: An American Legend," an earnest, leaden epic directed by Walter Hill from a reverential screenplay by John Milius and Larry Gross. No matter that this film's narrator is actually Britton Davis, played as a bland young West Point graduate by Matt Damon and urging the story forward with colorless observations. The real flavor of Davis's account, and of the ferocity that earned Geronimo his place in history, is nowhere evident on screen. 
If the baby, so to speak, is Geronimo's dauntless fighting spirit, it has been thrown out with the bath water of outmoded film stereotypes regarding American Indians. Shooting evocatively amid Utah landscapes that summon John Ford's westerns, Mr. Hill finds ample opportunities to settle old scores. The contempt and condescension with which Indian warriors were so often treated has given way to a warm bath of noble sentiments, none of which advances this film's dramatic purposes at all. "With all this land, why is there no room for the Apache?" asks Geronimo, on one of the many occasions when the film's characters seem to speak their lines in capital letters. "Why does the White-Eye want all land?" 
As played by Wes Studi, who was so formidable and effective as Magua in "The Last of the Mohicans," Geronimo is more often made to seem gently perplexed than fierce. This is more a dramatic problem than a political one, since all the film's actors share a placid, reasonable demeanor that becomes unexpectedly dull. As the film recounts the last battles, in the 1880's, between the Chiricahua Apache and the American and Mexican soldiers who overwhelmingly outnumbered them, it adopts an attitude of undifferentiated regret. Almost no one dares play the villain in the fight that destroyed the Indians' independence and altered their destiny. 
The film views the events it depicts as part of a colossal misunderstanding, rarely doing justice to the Apaches' anger or going so far as to assign blame. The story's American soldiers are an unusually open-minded group, led at first by Brig. Gen. George Crook (Gene Hackman). General Crook, such an easygoing officer that he at one point invites Geronimo in for coffee, offers Mr. Hackman a role not even he can breathe much life into. Potentially more interesting is another nice-guy officer, Lieut. Charles Gatewood, played by Jason Patric with a soft, purring drawl and a pensive manner. The formidable Mr. Hill ("The Warriors," "The Long Riders") has more often presented tough, vinegary characters who don't waste time questioning their sense of purpose. This subject brings out his kinder, gentler side, which effectively reins him in. 
Also in the film, and showing some of its few signs of life, is Robert Duvall as one of the story's maverick characters, a veteran Indian scout named Al Sieber. Sieber sometimes voices a healthy skepticism that would have been welcome elsewhere in the story. 
The dialogue ("It is good to see the great warrior") does not seem any weightier by virtue of its having been translated into the Apache language in some places. The scenery is automatically vivid, especially when it takes advantage of the landscape's stark contrasts, but Lloyd Ahern's cinematography is sometimes suffused with dusty reddish tones. Even the musical score by the resourceful Ry Cooder has a droning, authentic quality, suggesting that earnestness has taken precedence over energy. It has, every time. 
"Geronimo: An American Legend" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence.

‽Bank Robber‽,‽The title character of Nick Mead's terminally whimsical satire, "Bank Robber," is a handsome thief named Billy (Patrick Dempsey), who, whenever he needs money, simply dresses up in a fancy business suit and holds up a bank. As the movie begins, Billy has decided that it's time to retire. All he needs is enough money to buy the sloop of his dreams and sail off into a tropical sunset with his girlfriend, Selina (Olivia D'Abo). 
Billy pulls off his final heist but makes one fatal mistake. He fails to destroy a surveillance camera. No sooner has he hid out in the Heartbreak Hotel than he finds his own image flashed on the television news. 
"Bank Robber," which was filmed in Los Angeles, wants to evoke a similar mixture of urban nightmare and surreal zaniness as Martin Scorsese's New York fantasy "After Hours," but it lacks the focus of Mr. Scorsese's comedy. Most of the movie, which is the directorial debut of Mr. Mead, an English film maker, is set in Billy's hotel hideaway where he discovers that he is anything but anonymous. A greedy desk clerk, who recognizes his picture, extorts hundreds of dollars for changing a light bulb. A pizza delivery man, a drug dealer and a messenger from a home shopping program hold him up for more cash. A television news crew, informed of his whereabouts, also arrives to interview him. 
In between visitors, he drifts off into surreal reveries about his true love, who is actually sleeping with his best friend, Chris (James Garde). The only warm encounter Billy enjoys is with Priscilla (Lisa Bonet), a call girl he summons and who promptly falls in love with him. 
Billy is also the object of an extremely lackadaisical manhunt led by two pot-smoking policemen (Judge Reinhold and Forest Whitaker). The scenes in which they exchange absurd 1940's-style cliches about how Billy grew up in a bad neighborhood are the movie's lamest. 
Among the topics spoofed by the movie, which opens today at the Village East, are Billy the Kid, outlaw celebrity and the "Lethal Weapon" series. But the humor is both too oblique and too mild-mannered for the movie to cohere as a modern comic fable. It amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected tangents that come to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. 
For all its flightiness, "Bank Robber" is not without charm. Mr. Dempsey's Billy is an endearing, romantic jerk who hardly has a mean bone in his body. The film also has some of the juicier sex scenes to be found in a recent movie. The chemistry between Mr. Dempsey and Ms. Bonet, who both exude a carefree animal magnetism, gives "Bank Robber" a heady erotic glow. 
"Bank Robber" has been rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It includes explicit sex scenes that stop short of pornography.

‽Six Degrees of Separation‽,‽The Fifth Avenue apartment where much of "Six Degrees of Separation" unfolds is filled with expensive artifacts, most notably Flan and Ouisa Kittredge themselves. Flan (Donald Sutherland) and Ouisa (Stockard Channing), a self-important art dealer and the wife he describes as "a Dada manifesto," live all too comfortably within this sanctuary. The Kittredges are serenely unaware that their lives can be rearranged by a single uninvited guest, one who manages to tap into their fears, desires and hilariously fatuous daydreams. Neither Flan nor Ouisa might have suspected, before this story begins, that they could yearn so desperately for the respect of their own children, or hope to be extras in a movie version of "Cats." 
The visitor is Paul (Will Smith), the cunning, too-good-to-be-true impostor whose exploits are derived from a real news story. Paul has done enough homework to know how perfectly a fake connection to Sidney Poitier will sway uneasy white socialites, people who may be self-styled liberals but can still address a friend as "You darling old poop." 
It is Paul's visit that prompts Ouisa to muse about the title phrase, which in John Guare's play (and now his screenplay) presents destiny as a kind of mathematical puzzle. Chance meetings with exactly the right people can permanently alter unexamined lives. 
A seventh degree of separation, and the one that matters most here, is the gap between stage and screen. It has been bridged very aggressively by the director Fred Schepisi, whose frenetic and literal-minded approach to this material takes getting used to. Onstage, directed by Jerry Zaks with a backdrop of only two sofas and a fake Kandinsky, "Six Degrees of Separation" had a quick, precise comic style that left a great deal to the imagination. Much of the play's hilarity came from its lightning-fast juxtapositions, and the dizzying ways in which they allowed the story to escalate. The film moves just as speedily, but it's much more cluttered. In the presence of so much extra baggage, the screwball timing takes on a frantic edge. 
However, Mr. Schepisi's directorial vigor wins out over his film's skittishness. This version may horrify purists, but it winds up working entertainingly on its own broader, flashier terms. Seldom has a play been opened up this spiritedly, with a crowd of onlookers to hear Flan and Ouisa's titillating story (a role once played by the theater audience), a number of well-chosen New York locations and an array of people and paintings to flesh out Mr. Guare's social satire. The film uses its extras as skillfully as it uses a mock Kandinsky, which is prominently featured. It seems appropriate that the film's real and phony artworks are casually intermingled. 
Despite its busier style, the film is very faithful to Mr. Guare's story, with Stockard Channing in a reprise of her fine performance as its hilariously brittle heroine. Equally deft is Donald Sutherland, who turns Flan's fatuousness into a great comic asset. (When Paul delivers a speech that he claims is part of a thesis that has been stolen from him, Flan says solemnly, "I hope your muggers read every word!") Also amusing are Mary Beth Hurt and Bruce Davison as two more Upper East Side types who have been seduced by Paul and bitten by the "Cats" bug. "My son has no involvement with any black frauds!" Ms. Hurt declares indignantly, upon learning that Paul's trickery also involves her child. 
The story's college-age characters are also funny, especially Jeffrey Abrams (the screenwriter of "Regarding Henry") as the wildly outraged son of a divorced doctor (Richard Masur). And there is an amusingly sardonic turn by Ian McKellen as a visiting South African who happens to witness Paul's night at the Kittredges'. ("Your father means a great deal in South Africa," he informs Paul.) The film's only casting misstep comes with Mr. Smith, who plays Paul as a smooth, pleasant interloper without the hints of mockery or desperation that should accompany his deception. Mr. Smith recites his lines plausibly without bringing great passion to the role. 
As "Six Degrees of Separation" ricochets about town (and to Cambridge, Mass., where these mink-draped matrons travel indignantly to question their surly children), it has great fun defining the habitat of its privileged characters. "Are these all rich people?" Paul asks Trent (Anthony Michael Hall), the gay man who helps to coach him about the Kittredges and their circle. "No," Trent answers definitively. "Hand to mouth on a higher plateau." 
Patrizia von Brandenstein's production design is witty and ambitious in establishing the proper ambiance. And Ian Baker's cinematography gives the film a mischievously sophisticated look. Also helpful are the authentic extras who fill out the party scenes (Kitty Carlisle Hart plays one hostess) and look properly aghast over the Kittredges' ordeal. Less imaginative are the side trips to every minor setting (the Strand Bookstore, the Rainbow Room, a skating rink) that figures even faintly in this story.

‽A Dangerous Woman‽,‽In "A Dangerous Woman," Debra Winger sinks deeply into the drab role of Martha Horgan, a sheltered innocent living in a small California town. Characters like Martha have a way of attracting the storyteller's interest at a very precise point in their lives. It is the moment just before the character's peaceful existence is ruptured by some seismic force, a force like sex or death or a symbolic coming of age. "A Dangerous Woman" is soap opera enough to churn up all three. 
With Ms. Winger's eerily convincing performance as its centerpiece, the film creates a world of sexual chicanery that would do any television series proud. Martha is taken care of by her Aunt Frances (Barbara Hershey), a rich, beautiful widow involved in an extramarital affair with a state assemblyman (John Terry). That liaison starts off the film with a suitable bang, as the assemblyman's wife (Laurie Metcalf) drunkenly drives her car into the widow's front porch as a means of registering her irritation. 
Martha, a fragile creature in a girlish nightgown and thick glasses, watches this outburst in bewildered horror. But the film intends it as a harbinger of Martha's own act of violence, which is already in the works and will serve as the story's dramatic climax. "A Dangerous Woman" builds, vividly if not entirely believably, to an enduringly strange crime that almost resembles an act of tenderness, and to a crazy coda that reaches the last word in dysfunctional family life. 
Martha is kept occupied by a menial job at the local dry cleaner's, where some additional hanky-panky is under way. A co-worker there is Birdy (Chloe Webb), a kind soul who tolerates Martha's notion that the two women are best friends. Birdy has a no-good boyfriend named Getso (David Strathairn), who steals from the till and romances other women behind Birdy's back. Martha, who has a kind of moral clairvoyance, sees and abhors Getso's dishonesty when no one else can. 
Also on hand, in the story's sudsiest role, is Gabriel Byrne as Mackey, the handsome, hard-drinking carpenter who shows up to fix Frances's porch and manages to romance Martha along the way. Although played with a robust physicality by Mr. Byrne, Mackey is also the most literary conceit in this story, which has been adapted by Naomi Foner from the novel by Mary McGarry Morris. The scene that has him making a simulated confession, with Martha enlisted to play priest, makes it clear that "A Dangerous Woman" has its origins on the page rather than on screen. 
The film has been given an appealingly languid and intimate mood by the director, Stephen Gyllenhaal ("Waterland"). And its cast is attractive, holding the interest even when the story's contrivances are left needlessly exposed. (Martha's purchase of Tupperware is allowed to take on symbolic meaning.) Among the more entertaining small performances is Jan Hooks's brief turn as a cosmetics saleswoman trying awfully hard to adapt her sales pitch to a customer as challenging as Martha. 
But the only real focus of "A Dangerous Woman" is Ms. Winger's furiously self-effacing performance. She stares out perplexedly from behind Martha's glasses and tries to make the audience understand what Martha sees. Affecting a quizzical, birdlike posture (and a look so dowdy she resembles Gilda Radner in her satirical nerd role on "Saturday Night Live"), Ms. Winger breathes life into Martha's thwarted gentleness even when the film leaves her at a disadvantage. "A Dangerous Woman" never quite explains Martha's past, or the forces that shaped her. It only catches her at a fateful moment, when the makings of a small-town melodrama are already in place. 
"A Dangerous Woman" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, nudity and sexual situations.

‽Traps‽,‽Movies like "Traps" that glibly equate kinky sexual behavior with political and moral decay are at best naive, at worst ludicrous. This solemnly overheated  drama, which opens today at Cinema Village, is set in French Indochina in 1950.  Whenever it wants to put Daniel (Sami Frey), the ruthless French owner of a Southeast Asian rubber plantation, in a sinister light, it shows him making creepy passes at his nervous house guests. 
Those guests, Louise and Michael Duffield (Saskia Reeves and Robert Reynolds), are an English writer and photographer who have been engaged to concoct a photojournalistic essay for the rubber company's corporate publication. Although their assignment is to show Asian workers submitting happily to French domination, the world the couple stumbles into is far from serene. Communist insurgents are methodically taking over the country's rural areas, and even Daniel's trusted Asian servant, Tuan (Kiet Lam), has joined the  Vietminh. 
The Duffields watch aghast as their host acquiesces to the police torture of suspected terrorists. In the most suspenseful scene, Daniel's emotionally unstable daughter, Viola (Jacqueline McKenzie), and Louise are captured by the Communists and threatened with execution. 
The film's cut-and-dried morality is glaringly reflected in Louise and Michael's marital strife. While Michael is content to grind out the required corporate propaganda, Louise's eyes are opened to the injustices of French colonialism. In the most preposterous of several sex scenes, Michael gratuitously rapes his wife while Viola listens attentively through the wall. Later in the film, Michael wakes up in the morning beside Daniel, who apparently molested him after he passed out drunk. Michael immediately goes ballistic, and the melodramatic aftermath would probably have made Hemingway blush. 
"Traps" is the first feature directed by Pauline Chan, an Australian film maker who was born in Vietnam, where portions of the movie were shot. Adapted by Miss Chan and Robert Carter from "Dreamhouse," a novel by Kate Grenville, the film is handsome and atmospheric. And the cast, especially Mr. Frey, the fine French actor who was so electrifying in "My Life and Times With Antonin Artaud," brings an anguished seriousness to the roles. 
It's not the actors' fault that their characters don't make psychological sense. Their shrill erotic charades are metaphoric shortcuts in a film that can't be bothered to develop credible characters or tell a complex story. 
"Traps" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and some violence.

‽
‽The November Men‽,‽The clammy paranoid sweat that drips from Paul Williams's film "The November  Men" is so pungent that at moments it makes Oliver Stone's conspiracy theories seem like perfumed, Pollyanna-ish daydreams. Is the movie a joke on Mr. Stone? It's never clear how funny this disjointed satirical thriller intends to be. But its fantasy that a movie about a Presidential assassination plot could trigger the real thing carries the notion of the film maker as political provocateur to ludicrous comic extremes. 
Mr. Williams himself plays Arthur Gwenlyn, an angry leftist director who decides to make a movie about the assassination of President George Bush. ("The  November Men" was completed in 1992 before the election of Bill Clinton.) Instead of recruiting actors to play the conspirators, he enlists a group of malcontents who include two Iraqis, a black nationalist and an emotionally unhinged former Marine sniper named Vincent Duggo (James Andronica), who is signed on as a technical adviser. 
The climax will involve an actual Presidential motorcade making its way through the streets of Los Angeles. Arthur's secret hope is that one of his actors will snap and shoot the President, turning fiction into reality and his movie into a historical document a hundred times more valuable than the Zapruder home movie of John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
"The November Men," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, vacillates between  tautness and mockery with no rhyme or reason. The more comical scenes revolve around Arthur's icy cinematographer and girlfriend, Elizabeth (Leslie Bevis), who becomes so alarmed by his project that she spills the beans to the Secret Service. The most bizarre of the film's many digressions is a dream sequence in which Elizabeth, in dominatrix garb, menaces the Secret Service's chief agent (Beau Starr). 
Spicing up this paranoid stew is a seemingly crazy actor (Rod Ellis) who answers a casting call for someone desperate enough to kill the President. After being rejected for the film, he is discovered surreptitiously videotaping Arthur's activities and persuades the director to make him the project's official documentarian. 
While "The November Men" has some taut individual sequences, it is so infatuated with its own movie-within-a movie structure that it never settles down to tell a coherent story. Except for Duggo, who is played intensely by Mr.  Andronica (the film's screenwriter), the movie's possible assassins are the shallowest caricatures. And having led off with an angry political message, the  film abandons political rhetoric to poke nasty fun at self-important Secret Service agents and the loonies who make their occupation stimulating. 
The movie's wittiest conceit is a running visual joke about film making itself. It continually confuses the camera with a long-distance telescopic gun sight. In today's climate of media overkill, it suggests, there isn't much difference between shooting a movie and shooting a President. What matters is keeping your target in focus. 
THE NOVEMBER MEN Directed by Paul Williams; written by James Andronica; director of photography,  Susan Emerson; music by Scott Thomas Smith; produced by Mr. Williams and Rodney  Bryon Ellis; released by Northern Arts Entertainment. At the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This  film is not rated.

‽Dead Beat‽,‽Kit (Bruce Ramsey), the Elvis-worshiping teen-ager who generates most of the laughs in Adam Dubov's twisted comic spoof, "Dead Beat," is a junior Don Juan who will stop at nothing to make a conquest. Preparing for a date, he spends hours in front of the mirror slicking back unruly strands in his oversized pompadour and daubing on thick Elvis-style eye makeup. Kit has never been known to remove his boots, which elevate him several inches up to average height. 
Once on a date, Kit, if necessary, will fake a terminal illness to gain female sympathy. In one of his favorite tricks, he surreptitiously applies glycerine eye drops to elicit stage tears at the perfect opportune moment. 
After breaking nearly every female heart in his high school, Kit finally meets his match in Kirsten (Natasha Gregson Wagner), a hysterical blonde who is even more manipulative than he. He first sees her at a swimming pool where, for attention-getting kicks, she pretends to drown in a diving accident. 
When Kit presents his first gift to Kirsten, a $100 wig, she swoons with happiness. "Oh, Kit, you do love me!" she squeals. 
"Dead Beat," which opens today at Cinema Village, is set in Albuquerque in 1965 and has imitation 60's pop songs to go with its sendup of vintage teen-age fashions and manners. But having established its satiric premise, the movie dashes around in too many directions at once. 
One character, a wild girl named Martha (Sara Gilbert) who precedes Kirsten in Kit's affections, inexplicably disappears from the film until the very end. And before long, Kirsten herself abruptly vanishes. 
The events of the story are seen through the eyes of Rudy (Balthazar Getty), Kit's trusty sidekick, who earns Kirsten's eternal hatred by amassing an incriminating dossier on her past. Rudy abases himself in his pursuit of Donna (Meredith Salenger), one of Kit's rejects. Unbeknownst to Rudy, Kirsten takes revenge on him by spreading the rumor that he likes only anal sex, and he mopes through the rest of the movie bewildered by the cold shoulder he receives. 
The story takes a ghoulish turn when Kit takes Kirsten into the desert and shows her the body of a girl he claims to have killed. His entrusting her with his deepest, darkest secret, he says, is the ultimate proof of his love. 
It is right around here that the movie loses its grip. By carrying the petty romantic crises of 60's teen-age movies to absurdist gothic extremes, this would-be cult film stretches them way beyond the breaking point. DEAD BEAT Directed by Adam Dubov; written by Janice Shapiro and Mr. Dubov; director of photography, Nancy Schreiber; edited by Lorraine Salk; music supervision by Sharal Churchill, with score by Anton Sanko; produced by George Moffly and Christopher Lambert; released by Northern Arts Releasing. At Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 92 minutes. This film is rated R. WITH: Bruce Ramsey (Kit), Balthazar Getty (Rudy), Natasha Gregson Wagner (Kirsten), Meredith Salenger (Donna) and Sara Gilbert (Martha).

‽Heaven's a Drag‽,‽"Heaven's a Drag" is a film so determined to find inspirational uplift in the AIDS crisis that it seesaws wildly between witty drawing-room comedy and tear-drenched pathos. One minute it is dispensing Noel Coward-style repartee; the next it is awash in grief. Its final scene is a sentimental leave-taking complete with a golden archangel and a flock of seraphim. 
While navigating between these extremes, the movie also finds time to offer politically pointed vignettes on homophobia and gay-bashing. With all its inconsistencies of tone, "Heaven's a Drag" is still clumsily endearing for the way it wears its heart on its sleeve. You might describe it as "Longtime Companion" meets "Topper," with a dollop of "La Cage aux Folles." 
The two main characters, Simon (Thomas Arklie) and Mark (Ian Williams), are lovers who live together in London in a sexually open arrangement. Simon, a handsome television repairman and installer of satellite dishes, has kept his sexuality a secret from his virulently anti-gay job partner, Dogger (John Altman). Mark, who keeps house during the day, does a drag act at night in a gay club. Mark is H.I.V.-positive, and Simon, who is negative, is unable to face up to his lover's health problems. An early scene shows Mark watching a documentary on the AIDS Memorial Quilt and silently crying while sewing his own patch. 
"Heaven's a Drag," which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is remarkably matter-of-fact about Mark's illness, whose progress he describes to Simon in chipper-sounding phone messages. Then suddenly Mark is dead. Simon, who remains dry-eyed, stores away his lover's possessions and plunges into the life of a swinging gay bachelor. 
But shrugging off the past is not so easy. Strange occurrences begin sabotaging Simon's romantic encounters. Arriving home one evening, he is greeted by Mark, who proves to be invisible and inaudible to everyone else. To Simon's chagrin, the ectoplasmic Mark announces that he is moving back in. What follows are typical invisible-man gags, like the scene in which a visitor, watching a vacuum cleaner appear to propel itself around the living room, is told it is a new computerized model that responds to spoken directions. 
"Heaven's a Drag" is the debut film of Peter Mackenzie Litten, an English film maker, with a bluntly straightforward style. The screenplay, by Johnny Byrne, shows a knack for droll drawing-room dialogue. "I might as well be dead for all you care," Mark complains. "But you are dead," Simon reminds him. "Trust you to nitpick," Mark retorts. 
The badinage soon turns serious, and issues that were never spoken of when Mark was alive are finally aired. The movie turns into a soul-searching exploration of unequal love between partners, repressed grief and the legacy of Simon's bitter relationship with his dead father. 
"Heaven's a Drag" is very broadly acted, with buffoonish comic relief provided by Dilly Keane as the couple's eccentric upstairs neighbor, and Tony Slattery as her stammering, radical boyfriend. 
What gives the film its heart is Mr. Williams's portrayal of Mark. Spilling over with humor, vulnerability and feistiness, his performance almost succeeds in balancing the stylistic seesaw. 
HEAVEN'S A DRAG  Directed by Peter Mackenzie Litten; written by Johnny Byrne; music by Kiki Dee, Elton John, and Acoustic Alchemy; produced by Gary Fitzpatrick; released by First Run Features. At the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village. Running time: 96 minutes. This film is not rated.

‽
‽Arizona Dream‽,‽The 1992 film "Arizona Dream" arrived on the home video market with traffic-stopping credits and a badly checkered past. Starring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway long before the more staid (believe it or not) "Don Juan DeMarco" made the world safe for that pairing, it also features Jerry Lewis, Lili Taylor, Michael J. Pollard and Paulina Porizkova. Not to mention an arrowtooth halibut, a set of homemade flying machines and various sled dogs, who play prominent roles in the characters' reveries. As do the crop-duster sequence from "North by Northwest" and a willful red balloon. 
"Arizona Dream" was directed by the Bosnian film maker Emir Kusturica ("When Father Was Away on Business"), who apparently intended it as a festive, 2-hour-and-22-minute delirium about, among other things, American enterprise. Pink Cadillacs and pink flamingos are among its other visual motifs; Mr. Lewis wears a lot of pink and is made a walking symbol of go-getterism. He could have been an easy target, but he's appreciated in ways that accentuate this film's unexpected generosity, its greatest virtue. 
Even so, Mr. Kusturica had no idea what he was up against where American enterprise was concerned. In pointless attempts to market "Arizona Dream" for middle-of-the-road audiences, his film was shrunk down to two hours and jettisoned by its American distributor, Warner Brothers. Though it did passable business in Europe, "Arizona Dream" has taken three years to reach a movie theater in New York. It finally opens today at the Film Forum, which has gamely resurrected the full-length version. 
"Did I really make a film that they couldn't even release?" Mr. Kusturica asked rhetorically two weeks ago, only hours before he won his second Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival (for "Underground").  No, but he didn't exactly make it easy. In its clumsily truncated form, adapted to video dimensions that butcher the director's wide-screen compositions, "Arizona Dream" verges on the demented, impervious to any conventions of cookie-cutter film making. But even at its full length, showing off a more seductive rhythm and the buoyant humanism that is this director's calling card, it remains as ripe a subject for therapy as for criticism. 
What works best for "Arizona Dream" is that its lunacy is so liberating. Mr. Kusturica often favors a broad, rowdy mess over anything more structured, but he can galvanize his actors in captivatingly weird ways. Ms. Dunaway hasn't seemed this girlish since she was a girl.  (She's supposed to be playing the one bona fide nut in the film, but that's a fine distinction.) Mr. Depp, no stranger to risky roles, this time cheerfully wears a white skirt around his neck while imitating a chicken. Ms. Taylor sits and plays the accordion with scene-stealing ferocity, and has no trouble explaining that she'd like to be reincarnated as a turtle. There may be a few too many verses of "Besame Mucho" in the background while all this unfolds, but restraint is not on anyone's mind. 
In this slapstick psychodrama with a heavy dash of magical realism, Mr. Depp plays Axel Blackmar, the principal dreamer. He lives in New York, fervently imagines Alaska and winds up in Arizona at the behest of his uncle, Leo Sweetie (Mr. Lewis), who wants to do him a favor.  Leo thinks he can save Axel from a life of fish counting (that's what he does for a living, working for the Department of Fish and Game) by making him a car salesman. 
But Axel cares about fish with this film's brand of passion: "Sometimes I'll look straight into a pair of fish eyes and I'll see my whole life. That's something only fish can show us, and I love 'em." 
Once Axel winds up beached in Arizona, Mr. Kusturica is armed with more of the things only fish can show us, and he eagerly piles them on. Axel hooks up with Paul (Vincent Gallo), who's movie-mad enough to parrot some of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino's best-loved lines and to mimic the "North by Northwest" crop-dusting scene as a stand-up comedy act. (Try to imagine that.) He's also drawn in by both Elaine (Ms. Dunaway) and Grace (Ms. Taylor), a mother and stepdaughter. The women's rivalry surfaces during a dinner-table scene involving strangulation by pantyhose and a live turtle. Don't ask. 
If you're in the right mood -- the same kind of last-gasp 3 A.M. mood in which Mr. Kusturica and David Atkins, who wrote the screenplay together, may have concocted this mad mixture -- then "Arizona Dream" has enough patterns and parallels to hold interest, even if it successfully avoids all traces of reason. It may be necessary to be an arrowtooth halibut to follow it further. 
Working on unfamiliar terrain, without the ballast of Bosnian history that gives such heft to "Underground," Mr. Kusturica meanders along at an obvious disadvantage.  Even so, his "Arizona Dream" is enjoyably adrift, a wildly off-the-wall reverie. It's more than a fish out of water. 
ARIZONA DREAM  Directed by Emir Kusturica; written by Mr. Kusturica and David Atkins; director of photography, Vilko Filac; edited by Andrlja Zafranovic; music by Goran Bregovic; produced by Claudie Ossard and Richard Brick; released by Kit Parker Films. At the Film Forum, 209 Houston Street, South Village. Running time: 142 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Johnny Depp (Axel), Faye Dunaway (Elaine), Jerry Lewis (Leo), Vincent Gallo (Paul) and Lili Taylor (Grace) 
‽
‽The Madness of King George‽,‽All the world's a stage for King George III, the royally irrepressible ruler who holds sway throughout "The Madness of King George." While there's much to admire in Nicholas Hytner's splendid screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's neo-Shakespearean play ("The Madness of George III"), this exuberant tragicomedy is first and foremost a superb showcase. The monarch is a corker, and he commands almost all the attention. 
Grandly played by Nigel Hawthorne, who repeats his stage role with a stunningly mercurial display of wit, pathos and fiery emotion, this wily King is a figure to be reckoned with even when his powers decline. It was under the stormy reign of George III (1760-1810) that England's monarchy lost a substantial degree of its authority to Parliament, while England itself lost the United States (or "the place we mustn't mention," as it's called in the film). As for George himself, he began losing his reason periodically in 1788, when the film takes place, and was deemed quite mad during the last 10 years of his monarchy. 
Mr. Bennett's drama finds him at a critical juncture, still in control but well aware of the "catalogue of regal nonconformities" he presents to courtiers and loved ones. For all his comic fireworks, Mr. Hawthorne poignantly captures the King's understanding that his power may be slipping, that he may not be able to halt that process, and that a long list of adversaries eagerly awaits his decline. 
The star, the film maker and the playwright find something universal in the ways this embattled man fends off the inevitable, using every behavioral weapon in his arsenal to keep his enemies at bay. In the process, they also enjoy the essential hollowness of keeping up appearances in royal fashion. "Smile at the people," King George exhorts his family, with a puckishness that certainly resonates today. "Wave to them. Let them see that we're happy. That's why we're here." 
The early part of the film offers broadly entertaining displays of how this cagey, mocking King uses royal prerogatives to frazzle those around him. There is the music recital he attends, sweeping in to hear "Greensleeves" played on bells and then declaring: "Fascinating stuff, what-what? Let's have it again!" There is the fact that he refuses to let pregnant women be seated during this cultural ordeal, announcing: "If everybody who's having a baby wants to sit down, next thing it'll be everybody with gout." 
There are his ways of addressing the Queen sweetly as "Mrs. King," though he is also capable of accusing her of sleeping with their son. There is his sudden decision to rouse his servants for a run at sunrise, announcing: "Six hours' sleep is enough for a man, seven for a woman and eight for a fool!" There is the visit to a barnyard where the King, who regards himself as a farmer, has a nice, companionable chat with a tiny pig. 
Events like these convince those closest to King George that it may be time to question his authority. And Mr. Hytner, the prodigiously talented stage director (of "Carousel" and "Miss Saigon"), who directed "King George" for London's Royal National Theater and now makes a vigorous film debut, has no trouble explicating this chicanery in colorful, entertaining fashion. "The Madness of King George" mixes the ebullience of "Tom Jones" with a pop-theatrical royal back-stabbing that is reminiscent of films like "The Lion in Winter." That makes it a deft, mischievous, beautifully acted historical drama with exceptionally broad appeal. 
Mr. Bennett explicates a convoluted governmental crisis in ways that are both lucid and sly. Challenged on all sides by Prime Minister William Pitt (Julian Wadham); a Member of Parliament, Charles James Fox (Jim Carter), and his own son, the scheming Prince of Wales (a flamboyantly memorable Rupert Everett), this King even winds up reading Shakespeare aloud with his Lord Chancellor one day. " 'King Lear' -- is that wise?" asks the Lord Chancellor, who has been enlisted to play Cordelia. "I had no idea what it was about, sir," the King's physician replies. 
Mr. Bennett certainly knows what "King Lear" is about, but he is content with only an echo or two; for all its intimations of loss, "The Madness of King George" is largely lighthearted. Much of this film devotes itself to subsidiary matters like the abysmal medical practices to which the King is subjected once his condition becomes cause for concern. Typical of the film's contemporary asides is the declaration by one of the King's aides, a man named Fortnum, that he's tired of bedpan duty and thinks going off to Piccadilly to start a provision company might be a good career move. This film loves making hay out of hindsight. 
"The Madness of King George" begins blithely and takes on substance as the King appreciates his own frailty, especially after he is forced to become a patient of Dr. Willis (Ian Holm). This doctor effectively scares the King back to his senses, understanding the problem at a time when ordinary doctors regarded even a physical examination as an impertinence. (The King's malady was eventually thought to be porphyria, a metabolic imbalance whose symptoms include mental disturbance.) Dr. Willis remarks that there are unhinged individuals who imagine themselves to be king. "He is the King," he says of his royal patient. "Where shall his fancy take refuge?" 
As Mr. Hytner and Mr. Bennett follow that fancy so engagingly, "The Madness of King George" also thrives on the talents of a fine supporting cast. Helen Mirren makes a patient and formidable Queen, tolerating even the King's overt lunges at Lady Pembroke (Amanda Donohoe), her lady-in-waiting. "Did we ever forget ourselves?" King George asks Lady Pembroke, during a spell when the madness has subsided and he can assess his life with uncharacteristic calm. "Because if we did, I should like to remember." 
As that suggests, this film eventually sounds grace notes that signal acceptance and understanding, even of facts that were heretofore unbearable. "We must get used to it," King George eventually sighs about the nation formed from his American colonies. "I have known stranger things. I once saw a sheep with five legs." 
"The Madness of King George" is not rated. It includes swearing, sexual references and bathroom details closely linked to the King's medical condition. THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE

‽
‽Street Fighter‽,‽If Jean-Claude Van Damme's newest action-adventure film, "Street Fighter," is remembered for anything, it will probably be for Raul Julia's flaming portrayal of Gen. M. Bison, an international villain of Hitlerian proportions. An insane warlord in the make-believe South Asian country of Shadaloo, General Bison is hellbent on world conquest. One of his tools is a lethal laboratory-engineered soldier, programmed to kill, who looks like a Frankenstein monster and speaks in an electronic drone. 
General Bison has tricks up his sleeve that are not deployed until the movie's chaotic final action sequence. The most spectacular is a pair of electromagnetic shoes that enable him to levitate and fly around like Superman while proclaiming himself a god. This role was Mr. Julia's final screen performance (the movie is dedicated to him). And the actor gives it his all, widening his eyes into an electric glare of cartoonish ferocity, swishing his cape and cackling fiendishly. 
Mr. Julia's nostril-flaring campiness befits a film that is the latest action-adventure movie to be spun off from a video game. Like other movies that originated as toy software, "Street Fighter," which opened yesterday, does not feel obliged to do much more than create a live-action simulation of a video game's rhythms. The movie is fast and jerky, with no narrative continuity and lots of candy-colored pyrotechnics and characters who talk in cartoon-balloon fragments, usually in a monotone. 
Mr. Van Damme plays Colonel Guile, an Allied Nations commander who leads a party of soldiers into Shadaloo City to rescue a group of imprisoned relief workers whom General Bison hopes to ransom for $20 billion. Subsidiary characters include a television reporter with surprising martial arts skills (Ming-Na Wen) and two young adventurers (Damian Chapa and Byron Mann) who keep getting in and out of scrapes. 
If Steven E. de Souza, who wrote and directed "Street Fighter," has captured the look and mood of a video game, the film is an otherwise dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue. As Mr. Van Damme fumbles through his part, you are likely to find yourself staring at the big lump on the right side of his forehead and wondering how it got there. 
"Street Fighter" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It is loaded with violence, but mostly of the cartoonishly bloodless variety.  STREET FIGHTER Written and directed by Steven E. de Souza, based on the Capcom Video Game "Street Fighter II"; director of photography, William A. Fraker; edited by Anthony Redman, Robert F. Shugrue, Ed Abroms and Donn Aron; music by Graeme Revell; production designer, William Creber; produced by Edward R. Pressman and Kenzo Tsujimoto; released by Universal Pictures.

‽I.Q.‽,‽The nice thing about "I.Q." is that its intelligence doesn't stop at the title. In a romantic comedy that mingles brilliant physicists with auto mechanics, everybody manages to seem smart. Most of all Fred Schepisi, the director, who has figured out how to get the absolute best out of his leading actors. Mr. Schepisi is so clever that his audience will have no trouble believing Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein, and that's just for starters. 
"I.Q.," which opens on Christmas Day, features wonderful comic performances from both Meg Ryan, who is newly calm and composed here, and Tim Robbins, who is all dimples and slow, easy delivery. Oozing total sexual confidence, Mr. Robbins plays a mechanic who really likes comets, and Ms. Ryan plays a scientist who doesn't much like auto mechanics. And happens to be Einstein's niece. Another thing Mr. Schepisi makes easy to believe is that when these two meet, they fall instantly in love. 
The point, alarmingly, is that brains aren't everything. "I.Q." is poised to announce that the heart matters more than the head, and that romance is such an equalizer it puts the theory of relativity on an equal footing with fixing cars. But "I.Q." is so smart that it doesn't really do much with this dumbing-down angle. It prefers to keep its characters warm, bright and interesting as long as it can. 
The humor can be supremely sly, and all the more gratifying since it avoids the danger of treating Einstein as a walking sight gag. Einstein to Ed, Mr. Robbins's mechanic, as Einstein hatches a scheme to throw Ed and Catherine (Ms. Ryan) together: "Are you thinking what I am thinking?" Ed, thoughtfully: "Well, what would be the odds of that happening?" 
Set in an idyllic-looking Princeton, N.J., during the Eisenhower years, "I.Q." is also a visual pleasure. Ms. Ryan has been smashingly costumed as the kind of cool, elegant blonde who would have driven Alfred Hitchcock wild. And Mr. Matthau's Einstein, who bumbles around town adorably in the company of his elderly, professorial cronies (including Gene Saks and Lou Jacobi), is no less attractive in his own shaggy way. As for Mr. Robbins, he does a mean Marlon Brando impersonation and a convincing job of sweeping not only Catherine but also the scientists off their feet. 
As written by Andy Breckman and Michael Leeson, "I.Q." is able to generate loads of good will before it runs into story problems. There's a central contrivance about making Ed look like a brilliant physicist so that Catherine will accept him, and this gimmick eventually overwhelms the romance, leaving the second half of the story rather flat.  By the time the film actually brings President Eisenhower to Princeton, "I.Q." has become a little silly in terms of plot. But the main characters are so strong that the film's gentle pleasures persist even when its focus drifts. Ed, gazing at the stars: "Do you know why a comet's tail always points away from the sun?" Catherine: "Yes!" He: "Me too." 
The film's biggest surprise is Ms. Ryan, who is seldom this serene. She's a much more captivating comic actress without busy mannerisms, and when she beams in this film, the sun really shines. One of the film's scientist characters says it best, speaking in the idiom that the screenplay renders most deftly: "Wonderful to the power of three." 
"I.Q." is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and a number of flirty double-entendres. I.Q.

‽Little Women‽,‽"Some books are so familiar reading them is like being home again," Jo March observes in the new film version of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel. She's talking about Shakespeare, but we all know "Little Women" is a book like that, one of the most seductively nostalgic novels any child ever discovers. As the gold standard for American girlhood, it lingers in our collective consciousness as a wistful, inspiring memory. Ladies, get out your hand-hemmed handkerchiefs for the loveliest "Little Women" ever on screen. 
Gillian Armstrong's enchantingly pretty film is so potent that it prompts a rush of recognition from the opening frame. There in Concord, Mass., are the March girls and their noble Marmee, gathered around the hearth for a heart-rendingly quaint Christmas Eve. Stirring up a flurry of familial warmth, Ms. Armstrong instantly demonstrates that she has caught the essence of this book's sweetness and cast her film uncannily well, finding sparkling young actresses who are exactly right for their famous roles. The effect is magical. And for all its unimaginable innocence, the story has a touching naturalness this time. 
Remember that these are fresh-faced teen-agers who wassail and embroider. They put on little plays for at-home entertainment; they live out the pieties of "Pilgrim's Progress"; they talk passionately about music and literature. ("Your spelling's atrocious," Jo snaps at Amy, her princessy younger sister. "Your Latin's absurd.") The Marches' rare neighborliness and generosity are enough to heartstrings by summoning a world more benign than our own. Even when this film becomes family viewing on home video, watched with a passivity so different from the no-tech, active atmosphere of the March household, its idealism will come through. 
The direction by Ms. Armstrong, who long ago summoned memories of "Little Women" with "My Brilliant Career" (1978), is sentimental without being saccharine. And the film maker is too savvy to tell this story in a cultural and historical vacuum. So this "Little Women" has ways of winking at its audience, most notably when the tomboyish, intellectually ambitious Jo March reveals that she has cut off and sold her mane of hair. "Jo, how could you?" wails Amy. "Your one beauty!" Well, this Jo is Winona Ryder and the joke is that she has beauty to spare, along with enough vigor to dim memories of Katharine Hepburn in the now badly dated 1933 George Cukor version. Ms. Armstrong reinvents "Little Women" for present-day audiences without ever forgetting it's a story with a past. 
Once the March sisters have made their introductory embraces -- and these are girls who embrace, never just hug -- the four familiar personalities emerge. Ms. Ryder, whose banner year also includes a fine comic performance in "Reality Bites," plays Jo with spark and confidence. Her spirited presence gives the film an appealing linchpin, and she plays the self-proclaimed "man of the family" with just the right staunchness. 
The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933. Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of "Interview With the Vampire," is a little vamp with a big future. 
Amy undergoes a jarring personality change when, after a four-year forward leap in the story, she grows up into the more ladylike Samantha Mathis. Meanwhile, Trini Alvarado captures the ladylike composure of Meg, the oldest and most marriageable of the sisters. Miss Alcott joked that the second half of her book ought to be called "Wedding Marches" for its way of realizing these young women's ambitions with a quick succession of nuptials and babies. 
As written by Robin Swicord, this "Little Women" works overtime to balance such recidivist plotting with the occasional feminist mouthful, mostly spoken by Susan Sarandon's exceedingly prim mother figure. This version emphasizes the "marm" in "Marmee" with an excess of instructional dialogue that echoes the thinking of Alcott's progressive Concord parents. So the film makes reference to transcendentalism and raises Marmee's political consciousness a few notches. ("I so wish I could give my girls a just world. I know you'll make it a better place.") While the sentiments are admirable, the stridency can be irritating, especially since the film's moral tenor is never far from its surface. 
There are also men in "Little Women." As they were on the page, they're a bit secondary. Ms. Armstrong deals with that difficulty by casting attractive actors to breathe life into shapeless roles. So the handsome Christian Bale makes a dreamboat out of Laurie, the boy next door to the March family. (If viewers have trouble understanding why Jo wouldn't marry him, Miss Alcott's readers had the same problem.) Gabriel Byrne does his best with the thankless, tedious part of Professor Bhaer, the shy older man who courts Jo and is one of the book's nonautobiographical figures. 
Eric Stoltz makes a puckish John Brooke, Laurie's tutor, even if he's the one actor here who seems to have wandered in from a later century. The March girls also have a father, but he is away as a Civil War chaplain when the story begins. Not even the joyful tears that mark his return make it credible that there really is an important man around this house. 
Speaking of tears, Claire Danes is given the job of coaxing forth great torrents in the role of Beth, the doomed angel of the March family. While no reader of Miss Alcott's ever saw Beth through the valley of the shadow of death dry-eyed, the film's Beth is its one relatively ineffectual character. Ms. Danes, the disarming star of television's "My So-Called Life," does a fine job. But Beth is a quiet character, and the film has become too diffuse by the time it bids her farewell. Once the sisters leave home and hearth, Ms. Armstrong has more trouble keeping the story's strands together than she did when the girls were part of a single pretty picture. 
"Little Women" also has a larger visual attractiveness, with picturesque views of Orchard House (the real Alcott home) and pristine, snowy Canadian scenery to suggest the rest of Concord. Indoor scenes have the warm glow of candlelight, and the production design is appealing without excess, in keeping with the Marches' limited means. The film's buoyant good looks stop just this side of trouble. One more violet painted on a teacup would have been too much. 
"Little Women" is rated PG. It includes violence, profanity, graphic sexual situations and . . . Not! It's the most innocent movie in town. LITTLE WOMEN  Directed by Gillian Armstrong; written by Robin Swicord, based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott; director of photography, Geoffrey Simpson; edited by Nicholas Beauman; music by Thomas Newman; production designer, Jan Roelfs; produced by Denise Di Novi; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time: 115 minutes. This film is rated PG. WITH: Winona Ryder (Jo March), Gabriel Byrne (Friedrich Bhaer), Trini Alvarado (Meg March), Samantha Mathis (older Amy March), Kirsten Dunst (younger Amy March), Claire Danes (Beth March), Christian Bale (Laurie), Eric Stoltz (John Brooke), John Neville (Mr. Laurence), Mary Wickes (Aunt March) and Susan Sarandon (Mrs. March) 
‽
‽Mixed Nuts‽,‽The dead man wears tennis shoes and stands on his head, covered with branches and disguised as a Christmas tree. "Mixed Nuts," Nora Ephron's frenetic comedy about a suicide hot line in Venice, Calif., is about as funny as that corpse, and about as natural. Adapted from the French film "Le Pere Noel Est une Ordure," it has a farcical tone that loses everything in translation, with only hand-waving, door-slamming and zany costumes left behind. A title song incorporating the names of nut varieties is only one of the film's desperate ploys. 
Ms. Ephron is generally so much funnier than this that "Mixed Nuts" leaves a mystifying impression. Not even its screenplay, which she adapted with her sister Delia Ephron, shows much comic style. The film's modus operandi is unleashing a horde of not-so-cute eccentrics in a confined setting and encouraging them all to talk, fuss and gesticulate at the same time. This leads to a scene with five people crammed noisily into the same bathroom, four of them oblivious and the fifth using the toilet. 
The revelers here include Steve Martin as a lonely-guy suicide prevention worker along with Rita Wilson, a nervous wallflower type who has to go sit in the bathtub, fully clothed, whenever life becomes overwhelming. Madeline Kahn plays their boss as a variation on her character in "The Sisters Rosensweig," which would be fine if the film were less hysterical and didn't require her to become wackily unstrung. 
Juliette Lewis, as a pregnant shop owner with a husband dressed as Santa Claus, is as funny as this comedy gets, which is a meaningful measure. If you can't guess whether she will go into labor at the height of the story's New Year's Eve frenzy, you haven't been paying attention. 
Staged as pure fluff without an ounce of ballast, "Mixed Nuts" succeeds only in getting its cast into Halloween-caliber crazy costumes by the time it's over. There is also a soundtrack full of pop Christmas songs, which don't do for this film what Jimmy Durante did for Ms. Ephron's "Sleepless in Seattle." 
The cast (including Rob Reiner, Robert Klein, Anthony LaPaglia and Liev Shreiber as a very large transvestite) inspires good will whenever possible. But in the case of Adam Sandler, it's out of the question. Mr. Sandler dresses as a gondolier, plays the ukulele and sings stupid little nonsense songs in an irritating falsetto. If you didn't know this was part of his established shtick on "Saturday Night Live," you might think "Mixed Nuts" was simply crazy. 
"Mixed Nuts" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, sexual references and jokey violence. MIXED NUTS Directed by Nora Ephron; written by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron, based on the French film "Le Pere Noel Est une Ordure"; director of photography, Sven Nykvist; edited by Robert Reitano; music by George Fenton; production designer, Bill Groom; produced by Paul Junger Witt, Tony Thomas and Joseph Hartwick; released by Tri-Star Pictures. Running time: 97 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

‽
‽Camilla‽,‽Jessica Tandy's graceful presence in one of her final roles gives "Camilla" a valedictory grandeur. Though this is by far the lesser of two new films dedicated to Tandy's memory (the other is "Nobody's Fool," opening next week), it's the one that gives this great, unforgettable actress the more substantial showcase. "Camilla" spends an awful lot of time admiring Tandy in the title role, but that admiration is deserved. She moves enchantingly through an otherwise treacly film that wouldn't work without her. 
Tandy, who died in September at the age of 85, approached this film with daring and surprising ease. While "Camilla" reveres its heroine, hers is hardly a standard great-lady role. Not every octogenarian actress would be game for skinny-dipping, fishing, violin playing and a wonderfully tender bedroom scene with her real-life husband. When Tandy and Hume Cronyn finish the film with a courtly scene on a beach at sunset, they provide a gallant, heartbreaking flourish. 
As played by Tandy, Camilla is a free spirit whose wit and vitality are undimmed by age. She was once a concert violinist, and she is full of grand, untrustworthy stories of her musical heyday. Those memories are coaxed forth by the arrival of Freda (Bridget Fonda) on the Georgia island where Camilla now lives a sheltered life. Freda is an aspiring musician, which gives her and Camilla rather too much reason to talk about their art. 
The two women become friends through ungainly plot contrivances that soon separate Freda from her insensitive husband (Elias Koteas) and send her and Camilla on a trip to Canada. Ms. Fonda, whose character is supposed to be discovering herself, performs a couple of wispy musical numbers and generally gets the worse half of this arrangement. 
The trip revolves around Camilla, who flaunts her joie de vivre every chance she gets. This character's flamboyance could easily have been unbearable, but Tandy fills her with tact and good humor. She is as comfortable pretending to have known impossible celebrities, from Gandhi to the Duke of Nottingham, as she is gently reciting a John Masefield poem to Mr. Cronyn. Tandy even does a credible job of pretending to play Brahms's Violin Concerto, which Camilla regards as an essential challenge and the film treats as a metaphor for her overall determination. 
Dressed strikingly by Milena Canonero and Elisabetta Beraldo, Tandy moves graciously through a range of escapades, ending up in glamorous white satin for a performance of the Brahms in Canada. Mr. Cronyn, as a violin maker who is Camilla's long-lost love, gallantly affirms the film's emphasis on both music and romance. Ms. Fonda glows prettily and is a soothing presence whenever the film doesn't require her to assert artistic pretensions. There is a picture of Frida Kahlo in Freda's music studio, where she writes songs with lyrics like "If I could give you anything, I'd give you back yourself." 
Also in "Camilla," which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is Graham Greene, as the kind of colorful eccentric who has been perking up road movies ever since Jack Nicholson joined Ms. Fonda's father, Peter, and Dennis Hopper in "Easy Rider." Mr. Greene doesn't do much more than create a detour and provide brief comic relief, but it's welcome. Maury Chaykin, as Camilla's son, a crass film-business type, is less charming. As directed by Deepa Mehta and written by Paul Quarrington, this mild, uneven Canadian film gets by on charm alone, and it is lucky to share some of Tandy's enduring luster. 
"Camilla" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, brief nudity and very discreet sexual situations. CAMILLA  Directed by Deepa Mehta; written by Paul Quarrington; director of photography, Guy Dufaux; edited by Barry Farrell; music by Daniel Lanois; costumes, Milena Canonero and Elisabetta Beraldo; production designer, Sandra Kybartas; produced by Christina Jennings and Simon Relph; released by Miramax Films. At 68th Street Playhouse, 68th Street and Third Avenue, Manhattan. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH: Jessica Tandy (Camilla Cara), Bridget Fonda (Freda Lopez), Elias Koteas (Vince Lopez), Maury Chaykin (Harold Cara), Hume Cronyn (Ewald) and Graham Greene (Hunt Weller) 
‽
‽Nell‽,‽How fitting that Jodie Foster, in "Nell," should play a free-spirited woman who dances to her own secret music. Ms. Foster has carved out just that role for herself in Hollywood, choosing unusual material and largely avoiding the mainstream. Her independence has been impressive enough to suggest that "Nell," the first film from Ms. Foster's production company, Egg, would be subtler and riskier than ordinary fare. 
And "Nell" is the work of Michael Apted, a thoughtful director ("Coal Miner's Daughter," "Gorillas in the Mist") who understands strong heroines and exotic places. With its isolated North Carolina setting and its title character, a mysterious young woman raised without any experience of contemporary civilization, "Nell" promises something well out of the ordinary. 
What's remarkable is how seldom it delivers. For all its technical brilliance, not even Ms. Foster's intense, accomplished performance in the title role holds much surprise. The wild-child story of "Nell" unfolds in unexpectedly predictable ways, clinging fiercely to the banal thought that Nell's innocence makes her purer than anyone else in the story. In light of the stock nature of the two other main characters, a kindly doctor (Liam Neeson) and a levelheaded psychologist (Natasha Richardson), it's hard to argue that point. 
Discovered when her mother dies, Nell is a strange, fearful young woman who speaks her own unintelligible language. When first seen, she makes a startling impression, behaving in a rivetingly feral manner. Scrunching her body like a chimp's, she keens and shrieks in wrenching, absolute, utter terror. These are gestures that send signals: to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where a star's ability to effect such a transformation is traditionally appreciated, and to Drs. Jerome Lovell (Mr. Neeson) and Paula Olsen (Ms. Richardson). These two join forces to help Nell. In the process, wouldn't you know it, they fall in love. 
As this may suggest, "Nell" has its overlay of conventional drama, one that too easily eclipses the fascination of Nell's own story. Before long, Dr. Olsen has set up shop on a cute little houseboat near Nell's cabin, and Dr. Lovell has begun to make house calls. Nell ought to occupy center stage in this story, but too much of the time she is relegated to the capacity of pet primitive. There is the terrible feeling that the doctors will be learning valuable lessons from their experience with Nell. 
Though all three stars are fine actors, only Ms. Foster's Nell commands real interest. And much of that interest derives from her sheer strangeness, whether she is swaying like a tree or speaking passionately in her indecipherable tongue. But gradually, after quite a bit of ecstatic moonlight skinny-dipping to affirm Nell's natural beauty, her thoughts begin to become understandable. What she needs, it turns out, is for the doctors to become a happy couple and love her as their surrogate child. 
The ways that "Nell" unravels its heroine's secrets suggest more entertainment value than science. It is one of the doctors' important missions, for instance, to overcome Nell's terror of men by arranging for her to take a nude swim with Dr. Lovell. "You think I'm planning to abuse the doctor-patient relationship?" he asks indignantly. Well, yes, as a matter of fact. "Nell" would have been more interesting and believable if it owned up to Nell's adult sexuality and also acknowledged that attraction. 
Mr. Neeson labors mightily to breathe life into a weakly written role. (The film is adapted by William Nicholson and Mark Handley from "Idioglossia," a play by Mr. Handley. Mr. Handley and his wife spent six years living, like Nell, in a secluded log cabin without electricity or running water.) He succeeds in radiating charm more easily than he does seriousness, but he does summon enough "Yes, ma'ams" to suit the setting. Rounding out this festival of accents is Ms. Richardson, who has such a familiar career-woman role that her special radiance seldom shines through. Mr. Neeson and Ms. Richardson generate palpable warmth, but their story should have been more secondary. 
Nell herself, rendered too stagy to seem authentically wild, reveals more about Ms. Foster's great skill than about the human condition. With the stark, luminous beauty of a woman in a Walker Evans photograph, Ms. Foster moves through "Nell" with an intensity that needed to be more uncompromising. By the end of this story, Nell has accommodated herself not only to the small-town folk of North Carolina, but to Hollywood, too. 
"Nell" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes brief sexual suggestiveness and considerable nudity. NELL  Directed by Michael Apted; written by William Nicholson and Mark Handley, based on Mr. Handley's play "Idioglossia"; director of photography, Dante Spinotti; edited by Jim Clark; music by Mark Isham; production designer, Jon Hutman; produced by Renee Missel and Jodie Foster; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 112 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH: Jodie Foster (Nell), Liam Neeson (Jerome Lovell) and Natasha Richardson (Paula Olsen) 
‽
‽Queen Margot‽,‽The year: 1572. The place: The Louvre. The aristocracy: Scheming and randy. Patrice Chereau's highly excitable "Queen Margot" presents a slew of double-dealing French noblemen in a struggle for power, fueled by ambition, forbidden passions and religious strife. At its center is a rare beauty who loves purely, suffers exquisitely and poses for many ravishing close-ups before this tale is over. It's a big, splashy role for the regal Isabelle Adjani, the French Garbo. 
Based on an especially convoluted novel by Dumas Pere that has been "unavailable to American readers for nearly a century" (according to a new paperback edition), this is a story involving dozens of potentially confusing historical figures. It incorporates the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, features several present or future kings, and culminates in both a poisoning and a beheading. Be grateful there won't be a quiz when the film is over. 
Mr. Chereau, a noted director of theater and opera, attacks this story of rival Catholic and Huguenot royalty with raging revisionist passion. Assuming his audience is thoroughly conversant with the events described here, he interprets those events with painterly style (the delicately beautiful cinematography is by Philippe Rousselot) coupled with incongruous, heavy turbulence to describe his characters' emotions. 
So here in the 16th century are hand-held camera work, rock star hairdos (the sons of Catherine de Medicis could pass for an aging heavy-metal band) and remarks like "Love me like never before!" and "I need a man tonight." In this overheated atmosphere, the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, involving the slaughter of thousands of Protestants by Catherine's minions, is actually one of the calmer episodes depicted on screen. 
"Queen Margot" has been given data-packed opening titles and a fairly economical version of this massacre, which went on at greater, gorier length when the film was shown at Cannes last spring. Though it runs close to two-and-a-half hours, "Queen Margot" is now considerably clearer and more sedate than it used to be. Still, the story's early scenes introduce an impossible number of significant characters, and confusion clouds much of the story.  The film's hysterical edge also remains jarringly intact. 
"Queen Margot" begins with an arranged marriage between the Catholic Marguerite de Valois, also known as Margot, and the Protestant Henri de Navarre (Daniel Auteuil), who will one day rule France as Henri IV. She has a lover, he has a mistress and the marriage has no meaning except as a method of quelling warfare between religious factions. The match has been engineered by the conniving Catherine, whose antipathy to Henri and his family is expressed in typically casual, anachronistic fashion. When the bride and groom remark about their mothers on the wedding day, Margot says, "Yours hated me." Henri's answer: "Yours killed mine." 
As played by Virna Lisi, whose shockingly witchy appearance and evil mannerisms won her the best-actress prize at Cannes this year, Catherine is indeed someone to be reckoned with. She manipulates the strange, unstable Charles IX (Jean-Hugues Anglade), the King of France, while clearly favoring another of her sons, the Duc d'Anjou (Pascal Greggory). The Duc d'Alencon (Julien Rassam), a third son, is also in his mother's good graces, and the happy family portrait is compounded by strong hints of incest, which also envelop Margot. One of the film's typically impassioned exchanges finds Margot very nearly being raped by her brothers. 
The good news about "Queen Margot" is that Mr. Chereau creates an atmosphere in which his actors' flamboyance can be entertaining.  Ms. Adjani is decked out gloriously to play the very young Margot, a raven-haired vision described by Dumas as a French national treasure.  She preens with all due magnificence, even when, during one of the film's most deliciously ludicrous moments, she roams the streets of Paris wearing a ball gown and a tiny eye mask, trying to pass incognito while searching for a lover. The man she finds, the Comte Joseph-Hyacinthe Boniface de Lerac de la Mole (Vincent Perez), is presented as so noble a figure that religious music sanctifies each Margot-La Mole love scene. 
Mr. Anglade, familiar for his mad gleam in films by Luc Besson and Jean-Jacques Beineix (as well as the recent "Killing Zoe"), is particularly impressive for his intense, unpredictable energy here. Mr. Auteuil, the fascinatingly subtle actor seen in "Jean de Florette" and "Un Coeur en Hiver," helps to anchor the film by making Henri an increasingly interesting figure as the story progresses. As the wicked Anjou, Mr. Greggory smirks insinuatingly in every scene, often to amusing effect. In a film this feverish, nothing less will do. 
"Queen Margot" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes full frontal nudity, sexual situations, much violence and several horrible deaths. QUEEN MARGOT  Written in French (English subtitles) by Daniele Thompson and Patrice Chereau, based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas; directed by Mr. Chereau; director of photography, Philippe Rousselot; edited by Francois Gedigier and Helene Viard; music by Goran Bregovic; production designers, Richard Peduzzi and Olivier Radot; produced by Claude Berri; released by Miramax.

WITH: Isabelle Adjani (Margot), Daniel Auteuil (Henri de Navarre), Jean-Hugues Anglade (Charles IX), Vincent Perez (La Mole), Pascal Greggory (Duc d'Anjou), Julien Rassam (Duc d'Alencon) and Virna Lisi (Catherine de Medicis) 
‽
‽Drop Zone‽,‽The most spectacular sequence in John Badham's deftly paced action-adventure film "Drop Zone" applies the esthestics of water ballet to a sky diving exhibition over Washington. In a night sky bursting with fireworks, a team of sky divers wearing illuminated uniforms arranges itself in glowing geometric patterns while plummeting earthward. 
Simultaneously, the movie's villains, a posse of sky diving criminals, is parachuting into the headquarters of the Drug Enforcement Agency. Their mission is to obtain computer information, including identification snapshots of a worldwide network of undercover drug agents, to sell to the leaders of an international drug cartel. The only man who can stop them is Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), a United States marshal who has overcome his fear of heights to pursue the gang in one aerial chase after another. 
"Drop Zone" is the second splashy action-adventure this fall to be set in the world of professional sky diving. In "Terminal Velocity," Charlie Sheen played a sky diving daredevil who rescues Russia's stolen gold reserves from a ruthless gang of former K.G.B. members. If "Drop Zone" has a plot that is only slightly less preposterous, it is more fun. And with the glaring exception of Mr. Snipes's performance, it is also better acted. 
From "Saturday Night Fever" to "American Flyer," Mr. Badham has shown a special knack for capturing the flavor of a tightly knit subculture in scenes that make a closed little world look dynamic and glamorous. With their own in-jokes, exclusive hangouts and roughhouse sense of humor, the sky diving elite, as portrayed in "Drop Zone," have the mystique of flying cowboys. The values of this society are embodied by Pete's sky diving teacher, Jessie (Yancy Butler), an attractive, flippant tomboy with a streak of vulnerability under her bravado. In Ms. Butler's wonderful live-wire performance, Jessie slowly melts from a defiant foe into a true-blue pal as she initiates Pete into the rituals of her profession. 
"Drop Zone" is better than most action-adventure films in presenting secondary characters with dimension. As Ty Moncrief, a corrupt former drug agent who leads the posse, Gary Busey flashes a lethally goofy grin that suggests an antic cowpoke gone rotten. Michael Jeter is equally sharp as Leedy, a whining computer nerd whom Ty bullies into cracking access codes. Corin Nemec as a sky diving novice with daredevil aspirations, and Kyle Secor as a veteran daredevil with a zany streak, contribute to the movie's view of the sport as an elite cult activity. 
Incongruously thrust into this setting, Mr. Snipes drifts through the movie seemingly unsure of whether to play it straight or tongue-in-cheek, and winds up wobbling between the two. In action sequences where the rest of the cast exerts itself intensely, Mr. Snipes remains poker-faced and unruffled. The only times he displays some personality are the moments when he is physically forced into a stressful situation. The most memorable is a sky diving simulation class in which the actor, blown into the air by a vertical wind tunnel, frantically flails around to make sure he doesn't land on his head.

‽
‽Disclosure‽,‽AT the end of her first day at the Seattle offices of Digicom, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore) can be found charging out of her office with her clothes unbuttoned, yelling, "You get back here and finish what you started!" to the man who got away. Beyond making the after-hours cleaning woman wonder just how Meredith landed her powerful position, this sequence is meant to provoke debate. It's also supposed to make "Disclosure," the glossy, techno-torrid film version of Michael Crichton's alarmist novel, look more daring than it really is. 
In the brave new corporate culture of "Disclosure," is Meredith's behavior truly threatening? Are there legions of saucy female executives ready to act this way? Should nice guys like Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) be worried about falling prey to such vixens? And why on earth is Mr. Douglas, an actor known to audiences as Mr. Kinky Philanderer for his steamier roles in "Basic Instinct" and "Fatal Attraction," playing the man who is sexually harassed by Meredith but just says no? 
Actually, Mr. Douglas is here in something more like his "Falling Down" capacity: as an ordinary Joe pushed to the limit by a big, bad, unreasonable world. In this case, unreasonableness is a high-powered babe who chatters meaningfully about "the new compression algorithms" while also saying, "You know, I like all the boys under me to be happy" and "You just lie back and let me be the boss." 
Meredith's subversion of old-fashioned womanly wiles is too stiffly contrived to be upsetting.  But what's legitimately disturbing about "Disclosure" is its utter confusion of technology and eroticism. The computer-age products in this film easily eclipse the human players, and the sex appeal of ingenious engineering is everywhere. Ms. Moore's bold mega-cleavage, presented almost as weaponry during the story's brief, all-important seduction scene, fits in perfectly with this film's other technological marvels. 
Meredith and Tom are supposed to be former lovers, though the film is too perfunctory about mere personal matters to make their past history plausible. A salient fact about their seduction scene is that Meredith has plied Tom with wine; not just any wine, but wine they once liked during a fact-finding mission to the vineyards of Napa Valley. Here is yuppie eros with a vengeance. And here's why "Disclosure" is more bloodless and farfetched than its stars' hotter movie hits. 
"Disclosure" also finds Barry Levinson, a director once known for warmly intimate films about believable people ("Diner," "Tin Men"), severing all apparent ties to the real world. Mr. Levinson's direction is proficient enough to keep the film moving, but it's too soft-edged and fussy to achieve the crisp, efficient manner best used to suggest cleverness and hide a thriller's glaring flaws. Mr. Levinson is never fully at ease with a story that for all its scientific ingenuity, barely has two dimensions. 
The real star of "Disclosure" is the business-world fantasy that is Digicom, an environment the film tries to make more inviting than any of its human characters. With production design (by Neil Spisak) almost as fancy as that of his overblown "Toys," Mr. Levinson confines the film to offices so casually, staggeringly sophisticated that the viewer may crave a job as a forest ranger before this story is over. 
The correct language for this workplace is so chock-full of layman-daunting jargon (a Crichton hallmark) that the actors' biggest challenge is to sound sentient while speaking. But it's never easy to suppose any of them has more than 10 percent of an idea of what he or she is talking about. As the film's confusing yet simple-minded denouement reveals, no characters here are as smart as their talk about milliseconds and prototypes makes them sound. 
Whether smugly delivering a corporate presentation or discussing a database while on her exercise machine, Ms. Moore is overweening enough to annoy audiences as a boss they'd love to hate. Certainly she has that effect on Tom even before she pounces on him, since Meredith has supplanted Tom at the company.  "You used to have fun with a girl," another businessman mutters darkly aboard the ferry Tom takes to work. "Nowadays she probably wants your job." 
"Disclosure" takes only one work week to hand Meredith her comeuppance, set up a scheme about a corporate merger and let Tom reassert himself in the natural order of things. But the week is not otherwise a busy one. This film really has only two big sequences: the harassment interlude, which isn't the show stopper it promises to be, and a scene that sends Tom into a virtual-reality corridor to look through top-secret company records. Children would enjoy the second episode, which is rife with special effects, if they weren't in danger of being permanently damaged by the first. 
Understanding a virtual-reality corridor isn't a prerequisite for following the film, but patience is.  Much of the rest is talky and uneventful, with legal maneuverings and corporate strategies substituting for more energetic drama. The film's biggest fun comes from watching Tom trying to convince his wife, Susan (Caroline Goodall), that his misadventure with Meredith was no big deal. "I'm so old-fashioned I greet my subordinates with handshakes," Susan says. 
Roma Maffia's performance as Tom's straight-talking lawyer is another highlight. Donald Sutherland has some sly moments as the company's suave boss, particularly in a scene that makes him part of Tom's nightmare. Dennis Miller and Nicholas Sadler play two amiable lower-echelon computer nerds, with Mr.  Sadler's resemblance to Kurt Cobain accentuated to suit the Seattle setting. But "Disclosure" hardly needed to be any trendier than it already is. 
"Disclosure" was adapted by Paul Attanasio with considerably less subtlety than he brought to writing "Quiz Show," but that bluntness is traceable to Mr. Crichton. The storytelling of "Disclosure" is too forced and polemical to be on a par with better Crichton tales like "Jurassic Park." This time, it's the author who's the dinosaur. 
"Disclosure" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, sexual references and one sexual episode. DISCLOSURE  Directed by Barry Levinson; written by Paul Attanasio, based on the novel by Michael Crichton; director of photography, Anthony Pierce-Roberts; edited by Stu Linder; music by Ennio Morricone; production designer, Neil Spisak; produced by Mr. Levinson and Mr. Crichton; released by Warner Brothers.  Running time: 128 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽The Thief and the Cobbler‽,‽“The Thief and the Cobbler” is to animated movies what “The Magnificent Ambersons” is to live-action ones: a staggering masterpiece that can never be seen in its ideal form. “Ambersons,” directed by Orson Welles, was completed but then mutilated by its studio, its original version lost; “Cobbler,” a dream project the animator Richard Williams had been working on since the 1960s, was wrested from him by financiers in 1993, incomplete by about 15 minutes.

‽71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance‽,‽Consider the word chance in the title of Michael Haneke’s 1994 feature “71 Fragments of a Chronology  of Chance.” An icy-cool study of violence both mediated and horribly real, the film follows a handful of seemingly unrelated characters all of whom — perhaps by chance, perhaps by divine intervention, though mostly through artistic contrivance — have the grave misfortune to be in an Austrian bank when a 19-year-old student starts randomly if purposefully unloading his revolver.  The film, which was never released in America, opens this week at Anthology Film Archives as part of a retrospective dedicated to Mr. Haneke, one of the great if occasionally more maddening voices in contemporary cinema. 
“71 Fragments” is the final installment in what Mr. Haneke has self-consciously referred to as his “glaciation” trilogy, which began with his first feature, “The Seventh Continent” (1989), and continued with one of his most controversial works, “Benny’s Video” (1992). Briefly put, “71 Fragments” is, like other Haneke films, a moral and philosophical meditation on the banality of evil and our nominal complicity, inside the movie theater and out, in a world in which a television news report on Michael Jackson is squeezed between horrors from Bosnia and Somalia. For Mr. Haneke, the point seems less that evil is commonplace than that we don’t engage with it as thinking, actively moral beings. We slurp our soup while Sarajevo burns on the boob tube. 
In “71 Fragments,” the former Yugoslavia smolders between snippets of jet-black film and scenes from everyday Viennese life. In one home, a woman and man struggle with their newborn; elsewhere, a childless couple struggle with a new foster daughter. An old man visits his daughter, a teller in a bank, only to be coolly rebuffed as if he were just another bothersome customer. A homeless Romanian boy eats garbage, then watches a woman play ball in a park with children and a dog that looks considerably better fed (and loved) than he does. For those who miss the point: a young man mechanically hits Ping-Pong balls spitting out of a machine, again and again, testing his will or maybe his sanity as well as the viewer’s patience. 
Born in Germany and educated in Austria, Mr. Haneke has emerged as an important force in world cinema in the last decade, principally on the strength of powerful provocations like “Code Unknown,” “The Piano Teacher” and “Caché.” These later, rather more accessible films are very much of an intellectual piece with his earlier work, but Mr. Haneke has in recent years mellowed his tone and adapted a more classical approach to narrative, adding French money and stars along the way. (Chance probably has nothing to do with these developments.) He’s still puzzling over the important questions  —  how do we live and why  —  but his outrage no longer feels quite as punitive, perhaps because he has come to realize that his wagging finger is not an arrow but a pendulum.

‽Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern‽,‽In every life there comes a moment of realization that what we assumed would always be there is actually vanishing. Our parents die, the houses we grew up in are sold, neighborhood landmarks disappear and sooner or later what we used to call home just isn't there anymore. 
Jeanne Jordan and Steven Ascher's absorbing documentary film, ''Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern,'' presents itself as a case study of the decline of a small-farming way of life in the American heartland. But the movie, which Ms. Jordan narrates in a deceptively chipper, faintly sardonic style, is really the story of her own coming to terms with the ultimate disappearance of home. 
The film, which won the award for best documentary at last year's Sundance Film Festival, is really an extended home movie starring Ms. Jordan's likable parents, Russel and Mary Jane Jordan, members of a hardy breed of farmers in northwestern Iowa who have worked the land for generations. Ms. Jordan is one of six children of the couple, who, like so many other agricultural families in the 1980's, found themselves getting ever more deeply in debt to increasingly hard-nosed financial institutions. 
After much anguished consultation, the Jordans decided that the most economically feasible solution  was to auction off their farm equipment, animals and other possessions to pay the debt, and give the land to their oldest son, Jim, to work, while they moved into town. That way, the land would remain in the family. 
The film presents the bushy-browed Russel (who was once runner-up in an Abraham Lincoln look-alike contest and who suffers from Parkinson's disease) and Mary Jane as laconic salt-of-the-earth types who face up to their situation with a tight-lipped dignity, although not without tears. Mary Jane, a onetime Iowa state 4-H president, is especially bereft over the sale of her Ethan Allen furniture. 
The Jordans' story, which the narrator humorously dubs ''a midwestern,'' is interspersed with scenes from classic westerns like ''Red River'' and ''High Noon.'' Straining a metaphor, the movie compares the auction of the family's belongings on a snowy winter morning to a climactic Hollywood gunfight. But for all the buildup, not much suspense is generated over the auction price of a combine and a herd of cows. 
In the film's eeriest scene, Ms. Jordan and her parents revisit an earlier family home, now uninhabited, in the once-cozy Iowa community  of Rolfe, which now appears to be a well-kept ghost town. There's the spic-and-span facade of Ms. Jordan's high school, which, she says, was recently closed for lack of enrollment. Everything seems to be snugly in place except for the people, who have gone somewhere else. 
Without becoming analytical, the movie, which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, describes the economic cycles of farm life and offers some rough statistics on the decline of American agriculture. (Since the 1960's, the number of farms has dwindled to fewer than two million, from six million). 
But what gives the film its elegiac resonance has little to do with the farm crisis or with western movie myths. The images of the land, with its windmill and its cattle, and of the Jordan clan figuratively drawing their wagons into a circle in hard times exert a nostalgic tug for a Norman Rockwell dream of which this family, in better days, seemed to have found a piece.

‽Champagne Safari‽,‽A picture may be worth a thousand words, but sometimes no amount of pictures can capture the precise image of a man's soul. 
Take the case of Charles E. Bedaux, the all-but-forgotten millionaire who is the subject of George Ungar's intriguing but undernourished documentary, ''The Champagne Safari,'' which opens today at  Cinema Village. 
Bedaux, a school dropout, immigrated to the United States from France in 1906 at the age of 19 after apprenticing with a pimp in Montmartre. Speaking no English, Bedaux arrived with $1 in his pocket. By the 1920's, he had amassed a fortune as a management consultant, peddling the concept of industrial efficiency to major corporations. 
By the early 30's Bedaux was doing business in 18 countries and was the squire of the Chateau de Cande, a 114-room castle in the Loire Valley that became a playground for heads of state, captains of industry, movie stars and royalty like the Duke of Windsor, whose wedding to Wallis Warfield Simpson took place there. 
But Bedaux's approach to business apparently was unfettered by moral considerations. Labor came to loathe this father of robotic efficiency. His long flirtation with Hitler's Germany and his attempt to realize his grandiose supranational personal visions without heeding the choice between Fascism and democracy demanded by World War II, led to his doom. In 1944, in confinement in Miami and about to be charged with treason against his adopted country, the United States, Bedaux died, apparently a suicide. 
Accompanied by portentous narration and interviews with people familiar with its subject's strange story, Mr. Ungar's film interweaves the biography of Bedaux with clips illustrating the history of his times and with the recently discovered motion picture record of an extravagant expedition that Bedaux undertook in 1934. Called the Bedaux Sub-Arctic Expedition, this doomed foray into the remotest reaches of the Canadian Rockies included not only Bedaux's wife and mistress but five nickel-plated Citroen halftracks, 130 pack horses, 53 cowboys and Floyd Crosby, an Academy Award-winning cinematographer who recorded the expedition. 
For all the pictorial riches that underlie ''The Champagne Safari,'' the film of the expedition coexists uneasily with the images of Bedaux's work and times. Parts of his life, like his first marriage, which produced a son, are left unexplored. The interviews raise speculation that the film maker never pursues, in particular the suspicion that Bedaux was murdered to keep him from testifying about other American industrialists whose hunger for profits led them to  deal with the Nazis. 
There is a mountain in the Canadian Rockies named for Bedaux. It remains, the film says, untouched and forgotten. ''The Champagne Safari'' raises Bedaux briefly into the light but leaves him similarly untouched and soon to be forgotten once more.

‽The Horseman on the Roof‽,‽All it takes for civilization to explode into a frenzied panic is a rampant cholera epidemic. The madness that attends such a plague is a gripping leitmotif that runs through Jean-Paul Rappeneau's gorgeously picturesque film "The Horseman on the Roof" like a cagey rat skittering across a banquet table. In one scene after another of this sumptuous 19th-century costume drama, an idyllic rural tableau worthy of Corot or Millet is shattered when a character suddenly goes pale, collapses to the ground and succumbs to racking spasms that quickly end in death. The victims attract flocks of crows feasting on human carrion. 
These horrifying moments are the ominous minor chords in a love story meticulously adapted from a much-admired 1951 novel by the French author Jean Giono. Its central character, Angelo Pardi (Olivier Martinez), is nothing less than 19th-century heroism incarnate. An idealistic revolutionary and an indomitably fearless soldier of noble character who stifles his passion for a beautiful married woman, he embodies values like honor and gallantry that have faded so completely from contemporary consciousness that the very words have a quaint, musty ring. 
That may be one reason the movie's sword fights, rescues and other feats of  derring-do, while filmed with a quicksilver lightness and fluidity, lack the impact of its scenes of agonizing death. In the era of "The Hot Zone," the image of a crazed mob storming through the streets of a plague-stricken city looking for scapegoats they believe have poisoned the water makes you wonder, what if? The hysteria reaches almost comic proportions when the guests at an elegant dinner party, learning that two latecomers have just come from a quarantined area, scream in terror and frantically scatter while a maid rushes into the dining room strewing disinfectant. 
Against this backdrop of splendor and social havoc, the movie spins the tale  of Angelo and Pauline de Theus (Juliette Binoche), the woman with whom he falls  in love as he accompanies her on horseback across the French countryside. 
It is the 1830's. Although a detailed historical background isn't crucial to  appreciating the movie, it helps to know that Angelo is a member of the Carbonari, the secret society of Italian freedom fighters that flourished in the early 19th century. Angelo has exiled himself to France along with many of his fellow revolutionaries because the Austrian Empire, which wants to crush revolutionary movements throughout Europe, has installed a puppet king in their  homeland. But even in France, the Carbonari are pursued by Austrian spies. In the movie's opening scene, set in Aix-en-Provence during a summer carnival, imperial agents break into the home of a Carbonaro and drag him off as his wife  dashes into the street to find Angelo and warn him to leave town at once. 
Angelo flees to the city of Manosque just as the epidemic strikes and finds himself pursued by a rabid mob. Following a dizzying rooftop chase, he steals into a well-appointed house whose sole inhabitant, Pauline, is remarkably unfazed by his presence and gives him food and shelter. In gratitude for her help, he insists on changing his plans to return to Italy and accompanying her on the journey to her hometown of Theus, where she expects to rejoin her much-older husband. The trip is fraught with danger, and the pair find themselves alternately fighting off and hiding from French soldiers enforcing a  quarantine that has been imposed. 
The story is haunted by two questions. Will the growing attraction between the impeccably chivalrous Angelo and his companion be consummated? And will the  plague they are outrunning catch up with them? Their perilous odyssey is filled  with swashbuckling adventures, sudden changes of plan and heated emotional conflict between the fiercely independent Pauline and Angelo, who is determined  to see her home safely. 
"The Horseman on the Roof," which opens today at the Paris, is wonderful to look at, and its scenes filmed during the summer in the south of France are intoxicatingly sensuous. But for a love story that aspires to Wagnerian heights, the film feels awfully muted. Although Mr. Martinez has the good looks and physical grace of a classic romantic hero, a crucial emotional note is missing from his performance. He is likable but never compellingly incandescent. Ms. Binoche oozes the very luminosity Mr. Martinez lacks. She conveys a mercurially  eruptive spirit that makes Pauline mysterious and utterly captivating. 
The movie aspires to an epic grandeur that is at once sweepingly romantic and contemporary in the lightness of its touch. Although that goal proves elusive, the film will still leave you dazzled with its vision of a beautiful world cleft by disaster. 
"The Horseman on the Roof" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or  adult guardian). It has violence, several scenes of people in death throes and a nude scene.

‽Delta of Venus‽,‽Sex without sweat. Sex without playfulness. Sex without expression, unless you call the sullen come-hither attitude of a Calvin Klein model an expression:  Zalman King's newest soft-core romance is a fashion shoot pretending to be an erotic film. Although the movie, which was adapted from Anais Nin's novel "Delta of Venus," is filled with pretty people shuffled into an array of inviting sexual tableaux, it doesn't have a trace of passion. 
"Delta of Venus" follows the sexual awakening of Elena (Audie England), a young American writer living in Paris in 1939 who dreams of falling in love "in  such a way that even the sight of a man a block a way could make her tremble and melt." Ms. England, an actress with the face of a young Lauren Bacall, recites lines like these in a somnambulistic high-pitched monotone with a peevish "Valley Girl" edge that divests them of any emotion. 
Lawrence (Costas Mandylor), the dream lover who rescues Elena from her malaise, is a successful expatriate American writer about to return to the States for a book tour. With his moistened lips and face full of carefully tended stubble, Mr. Mandylor resembles the early 60's Ringo Starr with a 90's make-over, but when he speaks he is as dull and affectless as Ms. England. 
During their artfully lighted couplings, the pair lock eyes, challenging each other to see which one can hold out the longest without rushing back to the mirror for a quick hair check. 
Once Lawrence departs, Elena is commissioned by an anonymous collector of erotica to write stories describing "a woman's inner desires" for 200 francs a page. In one scenario, a prostitute is sexually hypnotized by a West African clairvoyant with a muscular body and a shaved head. In another, a redheaded fascist with gleaming eyes pushes Elena onto a chain-link fence and rapes her. These scenes have all the spark and spontaneity of a contortionist act. 
Larded through the film, which opens today at Cinema Village, are dollops of  Nin's coy, narcissistic prose. Heated but oddly demure, these excerpts add an extra dimension of fatuity to "Delta of Venus": they make all the faked passion  look quaint. 
"Delta of Venus" is rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It has scenes with sexual content and violence. 
‽
‽Nico Icon‽,‽As sad as it is to watch someone endowed with beauty, talent and intelligence go down in flames, there is also something darkly reassuring in the drama of a golden being who willfully self-destructs. That voyeuristic fascination with doomed glamour is one of the guilty pleasures of Susanne Ofteringer's utterly haunting documentary film, "Nico Icon." Examining the unhappy life of Christa Paffgen, the German singer, songwriter, model and occasional actress who reinvented herself as Nico, the film locates the void at the heart of modern demi-celebrity. 
As a performer with the Velvet Underground and as a chiseled blond goddess fiddling with her hair in "The Chelsea Girls," Nico was the most stunningly beautiful and enigmatic of Andy Warhol's 1960's "superstars." In a solo musical  career that never took off commercially, Nico carried Marlene Dietrich's world-weary hauteur to an icy extreme on recordings in which she moaned her sepulchral speech-song in a deep, foggy voice that wove a death-entranced spell. 
During the 1970's, Nico, who died in 1988 at the age of 49, became a heroin  addict. The documentary's most chilling stories, told by James Young, her keyboard player for five years, describe the singer's horrifying knife fights with her manager on a tour bus filled with drug paraphernalia. 
Calling Nico "the queen of the bad girls," Mr. Young insists that the singer  was proud of the fact that "her teeth were rotten, her hair was gray, her skin was bad and she had needle tracks all over." In the film's excerpts from a 1986  interview, Nico, who announces that her only regret in life was having been born a woman instead of a man, looks scary, but still striking. 
As the film follows Nico from her German childhood through a rootless bohemian life in Paris, where she worked as a model, to New York and then back to Europe, a portrait emerges of a woman who seems to have been born disaffected. Her air of nonchalance, far from being a chic pose, reflected a profound spiritual emptiness. Acquaintances recall that Nico didn't like modeling and hated being beautiful. She had few friends and no interests. 
After Nico bore a son, Ari, by the French actor Alain Delon, who refused to acknowledge his paternity, she proved to be a careless mother who fed the child  a diet of potato chips. Mr. Delon's mother took over his care. Many years later, Nico introduced her son to heroin. 
Nico seems always to have been drawn toward death. At the height of her post-Velvet Underground fame, she had an obsessive relationship with Jim Morrison, who at their first meeting involved her in a stoned ritual during which she wondered if he was trying to kill her. Later she called him her "soul  brother" and credited him with encouraging her to write songs. 
The director waits until the end of the film to introduce the grown-up Ari. A disturbed young man who bears a strong resemblance to his father, he is mesmerized by his mother's legend. Once, when he was in a drug-induced coma, he boasts, she visited him in the hospital and asked if she could tape the sound of his life-support machine for a record. 
Enthralling and spooky, "Nico Icon," which opens today at Film Forum, includes many other comparably eerie reminiscences. In the end, its subject emerges as an embodiment of the aimlessness and morbid languor that were the shadow side of the unbridled hedonism of the 60's. 
NICO ICON Written (in English, German and French, with English subtitles) and directed by  Susanne Ofteringer; director of photography, Judith Kaufmann and Katarzyna Remin; edited by Elfe Brandenburger and Guido Krajewski; produced by Annette Pisacane and Thomas Mertens; released by Roxie Releasing.

‽Four Rooms‽,‽Since it's not possible to hide a brand-new movie under a rock, Miramax did the next best thing with "Four Rooms," trying to give it a review-proof opening  on Christmas Day. That amounts to an act of mercy, since the less said about this career-denting fiasco, the better. Preview audiences don't often look as seasick as the crowd filing out of Thursday night's screening. 
Why? Well, "Four Rooms" is a long-awaited omnibus film with segments directed by four talented young film makers who were free to indulge their wildest notions about what might go on in hotel rooms on New Year's Eve. Indulge they did. They piled on time-killing chat, strained attempts at kinkiness and enough  celebrity cameos to give "Four Rooms" the illusion of star power. The cast does  include some good actors. But you wouldn't want to see any of these people in a  traffic accident, and you won't want to see them here. 
The heaviest acting burden falls -- hard -- on Tim Roth, who plays a bellhop named Ted in a spirit of ill-advised homage to Jerry Lewis. Frenetic and broad even by Lewis standards, Mr. Roth's Ted is victimized by hotel guests in each of the four short films. The first, "The Missing Ingredient," finds him playing straight man to a coven of witches led by Madonna in a black rubber mermaid dress. The witches take over the Honeymoon Suite to perform rites dopey enough to give witchcraft an extra-bad name. 
The director is Allison Anders, who showed a keen understanding of female characters in her first-rate "Gas Food Lodging" but who treats the women in this film like idiots. The coven -- Valeria Golino, Lili Taylor, Ione Skye and Sammi  Davis -- gather with Madonna around an improvised caldron and dance half-naked,  looking ridiculous. They are trying to summon the spirit of a blond witch (Amanda de Cadenet) who vanished many years ago while wearing black lingerie and spanking another blonde. Something like that. 
Anyway, the witches have everything they need except a semen specimen, which  is where Ted figures in this equation. Ms. Skye, who was so much better in "Gas  Food Lodging," lands the job of procuring the specimen. Ted desperately overacts being flustered. 
Since "The Missing Ingredient" is so bad and runs first, it can be presumed to be the weakest entry here. But the next film, Alexandre Rockwell's "Wrong Man," is actually worse. This time, a man with a gun (David Proval) menaces a woman (Jennifer Beals, Mr. Rockwell's wife) whom he has gagged and tied to a chair. When she gets the gag off, insults and accusations of infidelity fly. 
Into this domestic spat comes Ted, who is eventually kissed by the man and regaled by the wife with a long, mocking list of synonyms for the word penis. When Ted tries to climb out a window, a man (Lawrence Bender, the film's producer) leans out the window and throws up on him. 
The next film, "The Misbehavers" by Robert Rodriguez, is the best thing here  for several reasons: because it has a sustained comic conceit, because it has Antonio Banderas delivering droll self-parody, and because the rest of "Four Rooms" looks downright unreleasable. In this segment, Mr. Banderas parodies hotblooded machismo as he plays a family man who decides to romance his wife (Tamlyn Tomita) while their two children stay alone in a hotel room. Ted is handed a big tip and told to baby-sit. 
The film spins some pitch-black comedy out of this situation and is helped by a confident performance by Lana McKissack as the older child. She calls Ted to report a steady stream of complaints. Among other things, her kid brother (Danny Verduzco) is smoking, drinking champagne, playing with a gun and watching a steamy dancer on cable television (Salma Hayek, Mr. Rodriguez's current muse, plays this tiny role).  Ted is not helpful, but he is terrified of Mr. Banderas's character, who is sooner or later bound to come home.  Mr. Banderas sends off this segment with the right punch line. 
Finally, along comes "The Man From Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino's first film directing since "Pulp Fiction." It finds Mr. Tarantino doing something not many  other directors would try right now: casting himself in a lead acting role. (He'll also soon appear in Mr. Rodriguez's "From Dusk Till Dawn.") Ensconced in  a penthouse with an odd bunch of cronies -- Bruce Willis, Ms. Beals and Paul Calderon -- Mr. Tarantino plays a guy who has been made jaded and frivolous by overnight success as a film maker. Coming from him, this is no laughing matter. 
Ted is recruited to settle a bet taken from an old "Twilight Zone" episode. If Mr. Calderon wins, he gets a car; if he loses, somebody will chop off his finger. Can the group tip Ted enough to make him do the hatchet job? Most of the film is about settling this nasty business. Along the way, Mr. Tarantino throws  in details that lamely recall "Pulp Fiction" without a trace of its cleverness.  There are empty discussions of beverages, brand names and pop culture. A phone call to a different location finds Marisa Tomei stoned and dazed before a video  game, picking up where Eric Stoltz, the drug dealer in "Pulp Fiction," left off. Andrzej Sekula's cinematography gives this segment a harsher, more glaring look  than some of the film's darker-looking episodes, which are set in hotel rooms painted the color of dried blood. 
The camera lingers on some slapstick from Ted as the final credits roll. Last week's preview audience refused to stay for this and set a speed record racing for the exit doors.

‽
‽Waiting to Exhale‽,‽Everyone has heard that Mr. Right is dead. The novelist Rona Jaffe announced  his demise 30 years ago in one of her catchier book titles, and since then the women's movement has driven several boxes of nails into his coffin. 
But is he really done for? Despite themselves, the four black women whose turbulent love lives are explored with a salty good humor in "Waiting to Exhale" all subscribe to the myth of a knight in shining armor. By the end of the film, adapted by Terry McMillan (with Ronald Bass) from her best-selling novel, one of the four actually finds her Prince Charming, and another has established a long-distance correspondence with someone who shows distinct Mr. Right potential. 
But these princely paragons are shining exceptions. Most of the boyfriends who parade through the lives of Savannah (Whitney Houston), Bernadine (Angela Bassett), Gloria (Loretta Devine) and Robin (Lela Rochon) are buffoons or cads or both. The women respond to their egotism, double-dealing and hilariously depicted sexual ineptitude with varying degrees of tolerance and amusement, until they run out of patience. Then, in time-honored soap opera fashion, they tell off the men who have mistreated them in speeches that have a flouncy dramatic flourish. 
Although "Waiting to Exhale" aspires to be more than a glossy soap opera, beneath its feistiness it is awash in romantic fantasy. Contributing to the heady atmosphere is a luscious soundtrack of pop ballads, most of them written and produced by Kenneth Edmonds, more commonly known as Babyface, and featuring  Ms. Houston, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Toni Braxton and half a dozen other pop divas, all singing near the top of their form. Although the songs slip unobtrusively in and out of the background, they function as a subliminal Greek  chorus that lends the movie a pink romantic glow. That glow matches the story's  Phoenix setting, a posh suburban paradise of rosy sunsets and large, immaculate  living rooms. 
Of the four main characters, Bernadine has by far the most drama in her life. And Ms. Bassett lends a raging, spitfire fury to the role of a wife whose rich smoothie of a husband dumps her for a white woman and then tries to cheat her out of a decent divorce settlement. No sooner has he walked out on her than she  empties a closet full of his fancy clothes into the back of a car, douses the pile with gasoline and sets it on fire. Ms. Bassett's fuming performance is the  movie's riskiest and most compelling, and gives the movie its dramatic backbone. 
Her friends' problems aren't as dire and could all be boiled down to a question of looking for Mr. Right. Savannah keeps falling for dreamboats with feet of clay. Her situation isn't helped by a bossy mother who keeps advising her to be patient and wait for her smug married lover to divorce his wife. Gloria, a hairdresser recently separated from her bisexual husband, is raising a teen-age son. Possible romance appears in the form of Marvin (Gregory Hines), her new next-door neighbor. Boy-crazy Robin suffers through a succession of sleazy lovers just for the sake of having someone. 
"Waiting to Exhale" is the first feature film directed by Forest Whitaker, a  fine actor who elicits flashy, full-bodied performances from his four leading ladies. Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a  pop star in "The Bodyguard" seem so distant. Ms. Devine gives her character, a woman of some girth, a sexy comic swivel, and Ms. Rochon exudes a smoldering heat. 
But as storytelling, the movie is little more than a collection of vignettes  strung around candy-sweet soundtrack. Like the score, whose high point is Aretha Franklin wailing her heart out in a Babyface ballad, "It Hurts Like Hell," "Waiting to Exhale" is a series of star turns by four appealing divas conjuring  glamorous dramatic fireworks for a director who clearly loves them. 
"Waiting to Exhale" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations and strong language. 
WAITING TO EXHALE Directed by Forest Whitaker; written by Terry McMillan and Ronald Bass, based on the novel by Ms. McMillan; director of photography, Toyomichi Kurita; edited by  Richard Chew; music by Babyface (Kenneth Edmonds); production designer, David Gropman; produced by Ezra Swerdlow and Deborah Schindler; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽
‽Sudden Death‽,‽Jean-Claude Van Damme is an actor best seen and not heard. And in "Sudden Death," his chilly new action-adventure film, he is so busy dashing around that  he barely has time to talk. The number of speeches he garbles in his heavily accented monotone can be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
This verbal blankness is part of his appeal. As Mr. Van Damme (and his stunt  doubles) execute the movie's many acrobatic feats, he comes as close as any actor can to resembling a flesh-and-blood comic-book hero who is all action and  no feeling (hugs with his character's children notwithstanding). In "Sudden Death," his derring-do prevents 17,000 hockey fans, among them the Vice President of the United States, from being blown to smithereens at the Stanley Cup finals in Pittsburgh's Civic Arena. During a chase sequence, he even hides from his pursuers by donning a uniform and impersonating the Pittsburgh Penguins' ailing goalie, with surprising skill. 
The movie, directed by Peter Hyams, who worked with the star in "Timecop," is one long countdown to barely averted disaster. Portraying Darren McCord, the  arena's intrepid fire marshal, Mr. Van Damme foils a sophisticated plot to hold  the Vice President hostage and force him to arrange the transfer of more than $1 billion in frozen Government assets into the criminals' bank accounts. If that isn't accomplished by the end of the game, promises the gang's ringleader, Foss  (Powers Boothe), chaos will erupt. A little extra time is bought when the match  between the Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks goes into sudden-death overtime. 
At different points in the film, McCord's two children, Tyler (Ross Malinger) and Emily (Whittni Wright), become the villains' pawns. The unctuously suave Foss isn't just greedy, he's sadistic. "Would you like it if I filled your mouth up with spiders?" he asks the little girl after she's become his hostage. Later, he offers her a glass of wine and a cigarette. "It's customary to offer these minor vices to people before they die," he taunts. 
For action-adventure fans, "Sudden Death" offers above-average pyrotechnics,  a body count that steadily mounts, and plenty of hand-to-hand combat. The most ingeniously grisly scene occurs in a kitchen where McCord improvises some new and deadly functions for professional cooking equipment. 
"Sudden Death" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has almost continuous violence, moderate gore and strong language. 
SUDDEN DEATH Directed by Peter Hyams; written by Gene Quintano, based on a story by Karen Baldwin; director of photography, Mr. Hyams; edited by Steven Kemper; music by John Debney; production designer, Philip Harrison; produced by Moshe Diamant and Howard Baldwin; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 110 minutes. This  film is rated R.

‽
‽Grumpier Old Men‽,‽There's something comforting about watching the Odd Couple turn into the Old  Couple. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau may no longer be sharing living quarters, but in the 1993 movie "Grumpy Old Men" and its zanier sequel, which opens today, these cantankerous next-door neighbors in Wabasha, Minn., know exactly how to drive each other crazy. And they have all the time and energy in the world to do it. 
If John Gustafson (Mr. Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Mr. Matthau) are thin-skinned grouches in their sagging flesh, their success with women is nothing short of fantastic. Have any two older men of modest means been luckier in love? 
The original movie dropped Ann-Margret, playing a purring earth-motherly sculptor, into John's lap, and she is back in the sequel as his perfect wife, whose favorite artistic subject is her husband's baggy nude body. "Grumpier Old  Men," which begins six months after the last movie ends, more than evens the score between the neighborly rivals by presenting Max with a compliant Sophia Loren, jiggling her cleavage in a bright red dress. 
The 61-year-old star, who looks sensational, plays Maria Ragetti, a much-married-and-divorced proprietor of an Italian restaurant that has sprung up on the site of John and Max's beloved bait shop. 
Furious about the demise of the store, the two friends, both avid fishermen,  wage a campaign to shut the place down. In their most outrageous prank, they send a guinea pig that is supposed to look like a rat into the restaurant while  a health inspector is present. Maria retaliates by bathing the conspirators in pasta sauce. 
Amid all the hostility, Maria and Max somehow develop a mutual crush. The furthest thing from a polished ladies' man, Max walks around rehearsing sweet talk in which he declares that out of all the fish in the sea, she's the one he  would like to mount over his fireplace. 
On their first official date, he leads her around with a flashlight looking for worms. Hoping to wow her with his culinary skills, he cooks up a love feast  consisting of an ominous brown "mystery stew" and stacks of peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. 
Relations between Max and John deteriorate when their children, Jacob (Kevin  Pollak) and Melanie (Daryl Hannah), abruptly call off their wedding. In the movie's funniest scenes, the two men briefly become the bitterest enemies, dispatching their pets on missions of destruction. Max's secret weapon is a vicious one-eyed dog that subsists on chili and becomes flatulent at the most inopportune moments. 
Held over from the earlier film along with Mr. Lemmon, Mr. Matthau, Ann-Margret, Mr. Pollak and Ms. Hannah is Burgess Meredith as Grandpa Gustafson, John's sexually avid 95-year-old father. Grandpa has a fling with Maria's sourpuss mother (Ann Guilbert) and puts a smile on her face. In a screenplay packed with sexual double-entendres, Mr. Meredith is given the smuttiest lines. 
"Grumpier Old Man," which was directed by Howard Deutch from a screenplay by  Mark Steven Johnson, who also wrote the first film, doesn't even try to make sense. And for all the vaunted grumpiness, nobody stays mad for long. In the tradition of "Moonstruck" (this film shamelessly borrows Dean Martin's "That's Amore" from "Moonstruck" and uses it to similar effect), it is a screwball sitcom that takes a relentlessly cheery view of human behavior. And its vision of old age is giddily reassuring. 
Grounding the zaniness is the chemistry between its two likable stars. Beneath their crusty eccentricities, Max and John are teen-agers at heart, a Wayne and Garth for the "Modern Maturity" set. As Max, his leathery face beaming with pleasure, might put it: "Holy moley, is this a dumb movie!" But it is also  fun. 
"Grumpier Old Men" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The screenplay includes many sexual double-entendres and references to flatulence. 
GRUMPIER OLD MEN Directed by Howard Deutch; written by Mark Steven Johnson; director of photography, Tak Fujimoto; edited by Billy Weber, Seth Flaum and Maryann Brandon; music by Alan Silvestri; production designer, Gary Frutkoff; produced by John Davis and Richard C. Berman; released by Warner Brothers. Running time:  105 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

‽
‽Dracula: Dead and Loving It‽,‽The title "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is so perfect that it's almost a good-will ambassador for Mel Brooks's slight but amusing new parody. Mr. Brooks  may no longer be at the forefront of silly comedy, but he's still laying on the  genre gags, horrible puns and enema references with dependable good cheer. So even if this "Dracula" is thin-blooded, its better moments redeem a lot of dead  air. It's hard to resist a vampire film in which someone says: "Yes, we have Nosferatu. We have Nosferatu today." 
Mr. Brooks has recruited the ever-sporting Leslie Nielsen to play a charmingly dim Dracula and give this film the feeling of an undead "Naked Gun."  Mr. Nielsen proves equally good at capturing the Count's hauteur and at falling  down a flight of stairs after slipping on bat droppings. The film, which follows the broad outlines of the familiar Dracula story, also gives its main character  an alter ego in the form of his own shadow. While the real Dracula tangos debonairly on the dance floor, his shadow has raunchier things in mind. 
Also on hand, and zanily good, is Peter MacNicol as Renfield, the lawyer who arrives in Transylvania to become Dracula's slave. Renfield's funniest scene should play well with children, since it has him joining Dr. Seward (Harvey Korman) for tea in the garden and sneakily trying to eat every insect in sight.  Mr. Korman, an old hand at this sort of anything-goes humor, plays the doctor's  stuffy English mannerisms to the hilt and sputters "Poppycock!" with all the proper indignation. Anne Bancroft makes a brief, uncredited appearance as a very strange Gypsy. 
Mr. Brooks also has fun with an accent since he casts himself as the very Teutonic Dr. Van Helsing, who says "attekt" for "attacked" and loves making his medical students keel over in autopsy class. Mr. Brooks and Mr. Nielsen are  clearly on the same wavelength, which makes this Van Helsing just fine as Dracula's nemesis. When the job of driving a stake through a vampire's heart gets messy, Van Helsing looks at the floor and observes, "We should have put newspapers down." 
Mr. Brooks also tries to keep "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" reasonably lively by calling much attention to the beautiful babes who captivate the Count once he arrives in London and becomes a man about town. Amy Yasbeck gives Mina Seward the right comic loftiness. And as Lucy, Lysette Anthony is slyly funny and so alluring that she causes Dracula to turn into a bat and fly right into her bedroom window. Unfortunately, the window is closed at the time. 
"Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual suggestiveness and double-entendres to make children giggle, and a slight amount of spurting-artery type gore. 
DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT Produced and directed by Mel Brooks; written by Mr. Brooks, Rudy De Luca and Steve Haberman, from a story by Mr. De Luca and Mr. Haberman, based on characters created by Bram Stoker; director of photography, Michael D.

‽
‽Cutthroat Island‽,‽IT'S cutthroat time at the movies, all right, when the last two weeks of the  year bring a stampede of bloated entertainments no one necessarily wants to see. Suicidal case in point: "Cutthroat Island," this winter's "Waterworld," which stars Thailand, Malta, two cannon-firing pirate ships, one monkey (maybe all the parrots were busy) and Geena Davis as a pirate queen. It's not possible to believe that Ms. Davis is the highly respected captain of a pirate ship, and it's not even fun to try. More interesting is the question of who had enough doubloons loose to think "Cutthroat Island" belonged in America's Christmas stocking. 
The director is Renny Harlin, who has said in supposed jest: "My motto is: If you build it, you either have to burn it down or blow it up. Otherwise, it's a waste of money." But in today's Hollywood those are often words to live by, and  Mr. Harlin ("Cliffhanger," "Die Harder") does have real talent for demolition. He may have found it a creative challenge to pile on explosions, vertiginous special effects and theme-park-worthy atmospheric touches (like a crab crawling  on a dead body covered with cobwebs). 
But along the way, something got lost: an idea of what this film's audience  might be. So "Cutthroat Island" proves too stupidly smutty for children, too cartoonish for sane adults and not racy enough for anyone who regards Ms. Davis  in a tight-laced bodice as its main attraction. The only serious incentive for seeing this spectacle is a fascination with extravagance, since "Cutthroat Island" is indeed scenic, hectic and big. Its excesses (just sit through the numbing list of closing credits) prompt nostalgia for the good old days when sensationalism was cheap. 
Mr. Harlin, who is married to Ms. Davis, has the slam-bang directorial gusto  to hold his viewers' attention whenever the actors don't happen to be talking. Unfortunately, that's not much of the time. The film has a busy plot, and the services of two screenwriters and four story writers yield the following: hidden treasure, a clue in Latin to its whereabouts and a handsome Latin-reading rogue  (Matthew Modine) to help either steal or find it. 
There are also plenty of lines like "Riflemen, prepare!" for intrepid Morgan  Adams (Ms. Davis), who duels and head-butts like a man but is otherwise very much the vixen. When not showing off high-booted, gun- and sword-toting bravado, she's offering visual evidence that the garter belt and Wonderbra date to the 17th century. 
In terms of plot, "Cutthroat Island" also cooks up an episode in which Morgan must impersonate a prostitute (a standard pirate tactic?) and another in which she disguises herself as a grand lady to visit a picturesque Jamaican town. When a wanted poster depicting an outlaw with collagen-stung lips ruins Morgan's masquerade, she must swing into action and wreck the town on a runaway carriage  ride. 
The film also dwells on the scenery-chewing evil of Morgan's uncle, Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), who wants to beat her to the treasure. Sadly, the credits fail to indicate who made up Dawg's name and who let Morgan exclaim "Bad Dawg!" at a crucial moment. 
All this might appeal to the adult audience's inner child if it weren't so coarse and mirthlessly silly. Not to mention grisly: the plot device that has Morgan slicing off the tattooed scalp of her dead father, Black Harry (Harris Yulin), and using it as a treasure map robs the film of considerable innocence.  "Holy Virgin! Harry's blessed head!" somebody exclaims when Morgan waves this artifact, which is bloodstained and hairy and really no fun to see. Somebody behind "Cutthroat Island" clearly thought it an amusing touch. 
The action sequences are often strong, with the high energy level Mr. Harlin  brought to "Cliffhanger." But that film looks like a model of austerity next to  this. This film's big moments are pumped up with torrential rains, gunpowder blasts, dizzying altitudes and a score so obnoxiously exultant it suggests the composer ought to walk the plank. The Thai scenery is beautiful (and vividly captured by Peter Levy's cinematography), but it inspires both awe and horror. Awe for the lush green mountains and turquoise seas, horror because two whole pirate ships (subtly named "Morning Star" and "Reaper") had to be built both there and in Malta. And because Mr. Harlin's idea of shooting scenes in a vast Maltese water tank instead of on open seas actually makes this a more level-headed production than "Waterworld." 
Among those hanging from the yardarms here, figuratively speaking, are Patrick Malahide as one of those prim, arch-British action-picture villains. (His could be called the Alan Rickman role, but Mr. Rickman himself, now in "Sense and Sensibility," has moved on to better things.) As a 17th-century writer who has hooked up with pirates for research purposes, Maury Chaykin can lay claim to the film's craziest role. 
As for the leads, Ms. Davis and Mr. Modine photograph well and are game for stunt work, which is all the material requires. (Mr. Modine is more impish and less lusty than his character is supposed to be, perhaps better suited to "Peter Pan.") The stars' biggest acting challenge is a scene that asks them to beam ecstatically at the sight of pirate treasure. They try hard, but their smiles look strained and the gold looks tacky. Besides, that cache is nothing compared  with the loot that's been buried here. 
"Cutthroat Island" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes considerable nasty violence, fleeting sexual situations and much sexual kidding around on the har-har level. 
CUTTHROAT ISLAND Directed by Renny Harlin; written by Robert King and Marc Norman, based on a story by Michael Frost Beckner, James Gorman, Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon; director of photography, Peter Levy; edited by Frank J. Urioste and Ralph E.

‽
‽Balto‽,‽The title character of "Balto," an engaging animated adventure story whose refreshing lack of pretension sets it apart from most feature-length cartoons, is an Alaskan canine who is rejected by his peers for being half dog and half wolf. Canine life in Nome, where the movie is set, revolves around dog-sled races that have the fervor of high-school football games. The local hero and top dog is an unscrupulous, predatory ladies' man named Steele (the voice of Jim Cummings), whose swaggering ways set female hearts aflutter. Steele and his cronies take delight in humiliating poor Balto (Kevin Bacon), who has a serious  crush on a sleek rust-colored huskie named Jenna (Bridget Fonda). 
"Balto," the newest cartoon from Amblin Entertainment, runs only 74 minutes,  but it succeeds in packing them with more than enough of wholesome wintertime adventure. At the same time, the film, directed by Simon Wells, skillfully adapts a true story into an easy-to-swallow anthropomorphic fable about courage, honesty and peer pressure, in which the schoolyard bully gets his comeuppance. 
The historical event to which the movie alludes is a diphtheria outbreak in  Nome in the winter of 1925. The epidemic was quelled when a dog-sled team traveled 600 miles to bring an antitoxin from Nenana. The rescue operation is commemorated by a canine statue in Central Park in Manhattan. In the movie's live-action opening scene, a grandmother whose life was saved by the timely arrival of the medicine visits the statue with her granddaughter and tells the story. 
In their fanciful interpretation of the incident, the four screenwriters imagine that a rescue mission led by Steele gets lost and that Balto, who was rejected from their team, sets out to find them. Joining him are his best friend, a wisecracking Russian snow goose named Boris (Bob Hoskins) and twin polar bears, Muk and Luk (Phil Collins). The obstacles they encounter include a  ferocious black bear, cracking ice, an avalanche and near-catastrophes on several precipices. 
The fable has its mystical moments. The aurora borealis appears on the horizon to show Balto the way home. And at the moment when his energy is about to fail, a white wolf appears at his side to inspire him with lupine fortitude. 
Avoiding the mythological grandiosity and freneticism that afflict so many animated features these days, "Balto" makes modesty a virtue. 
BALTO Directed by Simon Wells; written by Cliff Ruby, Elana Lesser, David Steven Cohen and Roger S. H. Schulman, based on a story by Mr. Ruby and Ms. Lesser; edited by Nick Fletcher and Sim Evan-Jones; music by James Horner; production designer, Hans Bacher; produced by Steve Hickner; released by Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment. Running time: 74 minutes. This film is rated G.

‽Tom and Huck‽,‽Aw, shucks! Was there ever a cuter, more adorable Tom Sawyer than Jonathan Taylor Thomas's glossy portrayal in the latest Disney movie, "Tom and Huck"? With his post-Beatles haircut and proto-grunge duds, Mr. Thomas's Tom is the very model of an MTV-wise youngster transported back to Hannibal, Mo., in the 1840's. 
Mr. Thomas doesn't simply mug, roll his eyes and strike magazine-ready poses  with the bravado of a child star who has studied his best camera angles. He flirts shamelessly with the camera and with everyone in sight, lowering his gaze, casting sidelong glances and flashing coy, enigmatic smiles. When he gives his sweetheart, spunky Becky Thatcher (Rachael Leigh Cook), her first kiss, the  camera muscles in for a close-up. A moment later, when he tells her she is "not  the first" girl he has had a crush on, she smacks him. He responds with the sly, sheepish what-did-I-do expression of a baby Clark Gable. 
Brad Renfro's mumbling, sour-faced Huck Finn is no match for Mr. Thomas's winkingly obsequious Tom, and their friendship has little resonance. The character is so underwritten in Stephen Sommers and David Loughery's screenplay  that Huck is barely defined. 
In the story, loosely adapted from Mark Twain's novel, Tom and Huck witness a midnight murder in a graveyard and swear an oath of secrecy. After the wrong man is accused and sent to trial, Tom breaks their vow and names the real culprit, Injun Joe (Eric Schweig), a knife-wielding varmint who flees the courtroom vowing revenge. Tom, Huck, Becky and Injun Joe end up chasing one another in an  echoing cave with a pit so deep it seems to extend into the center of the earth. Guess who ends up taking a dive. And guess who ends up with the buried treasure that started all the fuss. 
Early in the film, Tom cons the neighborhood boys into whitewashing his Aunt  Polly's picket fence. Whitewashing is as good a metaphor as any for a film in which there is not a black face to be seen. Directed by Peter Hewitt, "Tom and Huck" is Mark Twain by way of "The Waltons." 
"Tom and Huck" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some mild violence. 
TOM AND HUCK Directed by Peter Hewitt; written by Stephen Sommers and David Loughery, based on the novel "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," by Mark Twain; director of photography, Bobby Bukowski; edited by David Freeman; music by Stephen Endelman; production designer, Gemma Jackson; produced by Laurence Mark and John Baldecchi; released by Buena Vista Pictures. Running time: 93 minutes. This film is rated PG.

‽Jumanji‽,‽In "Jumanji," a movie based on a book about a board game, the players are endangered by evil monkeys, giant insects, rampaging jungle beasts and vines that shoot poison darts. Children excited by the prospect of such perils would be well advised to get out the Candyland and forget about this. 
But "Jumanji" isn't easily overlooked, as it has Robin Williams and runaway special effects to recommend it. Mr. Williams, giving one of his kindly performances rather than a funny one, plays a lad who has been held prisoner by  the Jumanji game for 26 years. This lost boy returns to his hometown as a middle-aged man covered with scraggly hair, which may be the film's scariest effect of all. 
Actually, there's plenty of competition for that honor, thanks to visual tricks that are allowed to overwhelm the movie. They are linked to verse spouted by the board game, which is the only rhyme or reason to be found here. (Sample couplet, about killer vines, with a debt to "Little Shop of Horrors": "They grow much faster than bamboo/Take care or they'll come after you.") The director, Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "The Rocketeer"), has a background as a visual-effects art director, and saves his greatest enthusiasm for unleashing mayhem. One of the film's biggest, least appetizing sequences involves the frenetic wrecking of a discount store. 
"Jumanji" is based on Chris Van Allsburg's illustrated book about children who summon jungle animals while playing a board game. This book, handsomely illustrated but shadowy and sinister, has only the most slender of stories, so the film essentially starts from scratch. It invents Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd of "Little Man Tate"), who begins playing Jumanji in 1969 in a New Hampshire town. A bad roll of the dice sends bats fluttering out of Alan's fireplace and lands him in limbo. By the time he returns as Mr. Williams, the town has changed drastically for the worse and Alan's parents have died. 
The book's two characters, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), have been turned into orphans living in Alan's former home. Together, they resume the Jumanji game in hopes of freeing Alan and paving the way for an "It's a Wonderful Life"-style dramatic twist, which arrives too late in the story to warm enough hearts. The more relevant movie references are to "The Wizard of Oz," as Judy has Dorothy's pigtails and some of this film's ghastlier creatures  resemble Oz's winged monkeys. If that's not unpleasant enough, Peter also grows  a monkey's snout and tail during one of the film's more bizarre episodes. 
It doesn't help that all the special effects in "Jumanji" look comparably uninviting, from the floorboards that trap Mr. Williams's face to the fake-looking wildlife stampeding through the town. Eschewing warm, cuddly imagery just as Mr. Van Allsburg's book does, the film affects a strange, artificial style that has the invasive weirdness of "Gremlins" but none of the charm. 
What's most alarming about "Jumanji" is its certainty that audiences will settle for a mixture of random gimmicks and easy sentimentality. With those assets in place and perhaps a tie-in board game to market, the film abandons all other prospects of coherence. At least Mr. Williams provides a reassuring presence, with solid help from Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier in the supporting cast. Ms. Dunst, as Judy, once again proves herself a spirited and cunning young actress who can survive floods, bugs and other perfectly meaningless perils with ease. 
"Jumanji" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes many menacing special effects that are liable to upset young children.

‽Heat‽,‽Al Pacino makes an unusual, not to say traffic-stopping entrance in Michael Mann's "Heat," in which he plays a police detective in the grip of strong passions. Mr. Pacino is first seen in bed, making heartfelt love to a woman the  viewer can't quite see. The sight of his face conveys intensity, naked emotion,  and something even more interesting: Mr. Mann's rare ability to reel in his audience with ingenious visual hooks. "Heat" offers nearly three hours' worth of such carefully offbeat glimpses, sights that explode ordinary expectations and do for visual imagery what the sound bite does for words. 
But three hours is a long time. It's long enough to shape a "Godfather"-caliber crime story, or long enough for an overly polished veneer to wear thin. And as "Heat" progresses, its sensational looks pale beside storytelling weaknesses that expose the more soulless aspects of this cat-and-mouse crime tale. Extraordinary actors, clever settings, a maze of a plot and a screenplay with nearly 70 speaking roles don't change the fact that "Heat" is fundamentally hollow and its characters haven't much to say. 
Or that their conflicts are so familiar, once a wealth of handsome window dressing is stripped away. Vincent Hanna (Mr. Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert  De Niro) are a cop and an outlaw locked in the classic dance, both obsessed with what they know will be a fight to the death. This could be a western, or it could be "Les Miserables," or it could be (and is) about high-tech gangsters who live in beach houses and covet bearer bonds. Whatever the milieu, the dynamics of this struggle are predictable, and Mr. Mann does little to improve upon them  with an overdose of moody romance. 
As that first shot of Mr. Pacino anticipates, each of the tough guys in this  story is seriously distracted by the woman in his life. Thus "Heat" creates a hugely complicated web of relationships, though they only occasionally create the illusion of depth. The film's habit of editing together various wife and girlfriend scenes serves less to underscore a prevailing theme than to show up the perfunctoriness of half the story. 
McCauley, for instance, is the ex-con and quintessential loner who orchestrates an elaborate heist at the beginning of the film. But then he meets  a woman in a bookstore. Eady (Amy Brenneman) comes from Appalachia, works as a graphic artist and thinks there's nothing about a man's buying a volume on "Stress Fractures in Titanium" that indicates a dangerous line of work. Eventually, McCauley thaws out enough to hope Eady can help him escape the world of crime and start a new life. Although Mr. De Niro otherwise gives a terrific,  tightly-coiled performance, he plays love scenes with Eady as if he'd rather be  robbing a bank. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Pacino's Vincent struggles to save his marriage to Justine (Diane Venora), whose bohemian beauty is as startling as her dialogue is awful.  For his part, poor Vincent must say things like: "I told you when we hooked up,  baby, that you were gonna have to share me with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet." And this: "I gotta hold on to my angst. I preserve  it because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge, where I gotta be." 
As in his "Last of the Mohicans," Mr. Mann (who wrote this screenplay) often  turns dialogue into nothing more than a necessary evil. The main event here is the show of visual pyrotechnics, demonstrated dazzlingly during several superbly choreographed crime scenes. The most breathtaking of these begins in a bank and  spills out onto the streets of Los Angeles, with gunfire erupting in a public plaza and the action tautly staged from start to finish. No amount of weak dialogue or transparent posturing makes a dent in sequence like this. 
The film's most highly charged confrontation is the one that occurs without shooting: a "High Noon" of the acting world, staged in a coffee shop between the two titans who are this film's stars. It's their only real duel, since their other scene -- a chase on a runway beneath landing planes -- can't be said to pose much of an acting challenge. And the coffee shop scene can't fail to generate sparks, not even when Mr. Pacino says he and McCauley have met "like a  couple of regular fellas." "Heat" doesn't otherwise have a sense of humor, but that's a nice joke. 
Mr. De Niro's wary restraint suits the film's cool, sleek style much better than Mr. Pacino's louder, more flashily demonstrative manner. (Mr. Pacino sometimes booms and exclaims as if worried the rear balcony seats won't hear him.) But both these icons, buffed and costumed and tonsorially empowered to look their best, become as fashionably right for Mr. Mann's tastes as Daniel Day-Lewis was in "The Last of the Mohicans" (or Don Johnson was in "Miami Vice"). Mr. De Niro, as the mastermind of a complex criminal operation, has a more active role here than he does presiding over "Casino," another three-hour epic with a more honestly volatile, less pretentious view of crime. 
The huge, well-chosen cast for "Heat" attests to Mr. Mann's eye for both esthetic interest and acting talent. Even small roles are so well emphasized that they show these performers off to fine advantage. Val Kilmer and Jon Voight don't have enough to do as part of McCauley's gang, but they help set the hard-boiled tone of the film's heist plot, as do striking character actors like  Tom Noonan and Tom Sizemore. On the police side, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine  and Wes Studi back up Vincent Hanna with suitable grit. And on the home front, Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman are photogenic performers delivering by-the-numbers domestic strife. 
Another very big star here is the city of Los Angeles, exquisitely rendered as a place of hard, beautiful surfaces, icy perils and velvet nights. There's nothing new about that conception, but Mr. Mann, his editors (Dov Hoenig and Pasquale Buba) and his cinematographer (Dante Spinotti) give this film's precise backdrops all the excitement that its title implies. 
"Heat" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It includes startling violence, considerable profanity and sexual situations.

‽
‽Cry, the Beloved Country‽,‽The first major film to be made in the newly democratic South Africa, "Cry, the Beloved Country" carries a heavy sense of its own historic weight. Proclaimed "a monument to the future" by no less a figure than Nelson Mandela, the movie, directed by Darrell James Roodt, is an exercise in solemn uplift that is touching despite an atmosphere that at moments becomes stiflingly reverential. 
In adapting Alan Paton's classic 1948 novel for the screen, Mr. Roodt, the young South African film maker who directed "Sarafina!," and his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have remained faithful to the hushed, semi-biblical tone of the  book, while using the cinematography and music to add a romantic gloss. 
As the camera drinks in the panoramic South African landscape of mist-shrouded mountains, the music by John Barry, who also scored "Out of Africa," swells with the same loftiness that infused the earlier film with a whiff of nobility. And the mingling of Mr. Barry's European-style music with fragments of Zulu hymns underscores the movie's dream of racial harmony. 
But while the film, which is set in 1946, has glimpses of South African culture that suggest the mounting racial strife on the eve of apartheid, it is essentially an interior drama. The story traces the fearful odyssey of the Rev.  Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), a Zulu Anglican priest, from his countryside  home to Johannesburg. 
Once in the city, he discovers that his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente), with whom he had fallen out of touch, is a prostitute, and that his brother John (Charles S. Dutton) a political agitator, has lost his religious faith. Worse news follows. With the help of Msimangu (Vusi Kunene), a fellow priest, he tracks down his missing son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who has just killed a man in  a botched robbery attempt. 
The victim, Arthur Jarvis, was a white man who had dedicated his life to helping South African blacks. Arthur was the son of James Jarvis (Richard Harris), a wealthy farmer and white supremacist who lives in the country near Kumalo. Reuniting with Absalom, Kumalo discovers that his son is not a coldblooded criminal but a lost, frightened man who acted out of fear. The young man is nevertheless tried for murder and sentenced to die. From their shared tragedy, the fathers of the killer and his victim eventually forge a deep and healing bond. 
The screenplay, which uses a sparse voiceover narration by Mr. Jones, sticks  so closely to the book that key passages of dialogue are kept entirely intact. And Mr. Jones and Mr. Harris deliver Paton's oratory with a subdued fervor that  makes each word count. When Mr. Harris reads a posthumously discovered manuscript in which his son indicts white South Africa for its inhumanity to blacks, the words have the ring of an excoriating sermon. 
The two central performances in the film, which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, are strikingly different in style. Mr. Jones's Kumalo is a sad, plodding bulldog of a man rumbling with suppressed thunder as he internalizes the onslaught of bad news, the weight of Job bowing his shoulders. Mr. Harris's  Jarvis, alarmingly gaunt with yellowish white hair, trembling lips and an eagle's glare, is flamboyantly volatile, more so than in the book. Beneath the haughty aristocratic facade lies a spoiled, hot-tempered crybaby. 
The film's turning point comes when Kumalo visits Jarvis and tremblingly reveals himself as the father of the younger Jarvis's killer. As the minister shakes with tears, Jarvis whirls on his heels, stricken, absorbing the shock, then swallowing his fury in a remarkable transformation. In a moment as transcendent as it is risky, the screen erupts with a volcanic emotion that cuts through the prevailing high-minded contemplation. 
Why risky? Because movies have become so invested in the unleashing of violent emotion and the escalation of hostility, that expressions of restraint,  reconciliation and forgiveness can easily be read as corny cop-outs. "Cry, the Beloved Country" is not corny, and it doesn't cop out. 
"Cry, the Beloved Country" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a scene in a brothel and some mild violence. 
CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY Directed by Darrell James Roodt; written by Ronald Harwood, adapted from the novel by Alan Paton; director of photography, Paul Gilpin; edited by David Heitner; music by John Barry; production designer, David Barkham; produced by Anant Singh; released by Miramax Films.

‽
‽Leaving Las Vegas‽,‽Ben Sanderson, played devastatingly by Nicolas Cage in "Leaving Las Vegas," is something other than the usual movie drunk. Nothing about him offers golden opportunities to the good Samaritan. Already in the terminal stages of alcoholism as the film begins, Ben seems to sense his fate and want to face it in his own way, with crazy bravado and a whiff of desperate romance. This small, searing film watches transfixingly as Ben plays out his final hand. 
As directed by Mike Figgis, who makes a long overdue return to the sultry intensity of his "Internal Affairs" and "Stormy Monday," "Leaving Las Vegas" has the daring to suspend judgment about Ben's downward spiral. This film simply works as a character study, pitilessly well observed and intimately familiar with its terrain. Mr. Figgis based his screenplay on a novel by John O'Brien, who committed suicide two weeks after learning that his book would be made into a movie. Mr. O'Brien's father describes the novel as his son's suicide note, which does not seem a farfetched claim. 
But "Leaving Las Vegas" is far less dolorous than might be expected. Passionate and furiously alive, it is brightened by the same unlikely bonhomie that has long kept Ben afloat. First seen gaily loading up a shopping cart at the liquor store, Ben has a courtly charm that is as beguiling as it is erratic. He can move from high spirits to furniture-smashing rage in a matter of seconds, but he never has trouble getting attention. 
The film begins with an exceptional bender, following Ben through the last gasps of his career in Los Angeles. He turns obnoxious in a restaurant, name-dropping about Dickie Gere and annoying the movie executives he meets. He tries to pick up a woman in a bar. ("You've been drinking all day," remarks the woman, played by Valeria Golino. "But of course!" Ben replies.) He goes to a strip club, gets so drunk he can barely see the dancers and takes home a prostitute who steals his wedding ring. He wakes up on his kitchen floor, having passed out in front of an open refrigerator. 
For Ben, this appears to have been an ordinary day. 
Leaving Los Angeles after being fired from his job, Ben moves on to the city of the title, a very different place from the coarse, brassy setting for "Showgirls." This Las Vegas is a neon apparition, beautifully evoked by otherworldly contrasts and lurid nocturnal light. (The cinematography is by Declan Quinn, whose work is as subtly distinctive as it was in "Vanya on 42d Street.") And here he meets Sera, whose very name (as in "que sera") suggests some kind of cosmic shrug. Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a Las Vegas prostitute, has somehow been waiting her whole life for a man like this. 
As he did in his fine, fluid earlier films (before being sidetracked by the unaccountably listless "Mr. Jones" and "The Browning Version"), Mr. Figgis gives his narrative a musical dimension. A sometime musician who composed this film's jazzy score, Mr. Figgis uses a haunting soundtrack (with several vocal numbers performed by Sting) to turn this into a sustained, moody reverie. Indeed, the film's musical effectiveness minimizes some of its dramatic contrivance, especially where Sera is concerned. Ms. Shue gives a daring and affecting performance, but she's essentially playing one more whore with a heart of gold. 
The awkward device of letting Sera talk about herself on a therapist's couch doesn't give her much added depth, though her troubles with a sleazy Latvian pimp (Julian Sands, with a flamboyant accent) add some color. And the screenplay's attempt to create an 11th-hour crisis for Sera seems false, too. For all Ms. Shue's warmth, in the kind of gutsy, unflinching role that often goes to Jennifer Jason Leigh, "Leaving Las Vegas" never rings entirely true as a bleak love story. Ben clings to Sera as a last straw, but he's still a man alone. 
Mr. Cage digs deep to find his character's inner demons while also capturing the riotous energy of his outward charm. The film would seem vastly more sordid without his irrepressible good humor. 
At the same time, without overworking the pathos of Ben's situation, "Leaving Las Vegas" fully conveys the health risks of gulping vodka in the shower, crashing onto a glass coffee table or otherwise lurching through life with Ben's particular abandon. A man who spends $500 for a prostitute's hourlong visit to his $29 hotel room (with "complimentary bar of soap" and lucky aces over the headboard) is a man beyond caring about the future. 
"Leaving Las Vegas" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity, profanity, sexual situations, graphic language, overall raunchiness and an enormous amount of drinking.

‽Hard Core Logo‽,‽''Hard Core Logo,'' a more straight-faced punk-rock descendant of ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' follows a fictional band from Vancouver on its chaotic, self-destructive farewell tour across western Canada. But unlike ''Spinal Tap,'' which cast a comically jaundiced eye on every nuance of the heavy-metal life style, this clever mock documentary, which opens today at the Screening Room, blends satire and sentiment in a way that keeps you emotionally off balance. 
For every suggestion that it is poking fun at the punk-rock esthetic (onstage, the bullying, alcoholic lead singer Joe Dick spits in the faces of his fellow band members), there are stronger hints that the movie, handsomely photographed by Danny Nowak, aspires to be a kind of romantic elegy to the punk-rock movement. As Hard Core Logo makes its way across the prairie, shots of its battered tour bus rolling through the farmland convey a mood of grand desolation. What does punk rock and its esthetic of defiance have to do with this landscape, you wonder? And what's to become of its four contentious rock rebels who are already well into their 30's? 
This melancholy atmosphere seeps into the scenes of the band's backstage squabbles, most of which revolve around the embattled relationship of the band's leader and prime mover, Joe (Hugh Dillon), and his lead guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie). Billy, who is waiting to hear whether he will be officially invited to join a big-time Los Angeles band, has temporarily rejoined Hard Core Logo. But once he's on board, Joe pressures him into promising not to leave. The movie toys with the possibility of a sexual relationship between the two but nervously backs off from investigating further. 
Rounding out the fractious foursome are its bassist John (John Pyper-Ferguson), a stammering manic-depressive on lithium who keeps a journal of the tour, and Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson), its loutish fun-loving drummer. 
To succeed, a movie like ''Hard Core Logo'' demands a certain credibility. And until the scene in which the group visits an English punk legend, Bucky Haight (Julian Richings), the movie feels real enough. But the idea that this gaunt, angry living  legend would retire to an isolated farmhouse in the Canadian heartland is ludicrous. 
When Bucky and the members of Hard Core Logo take a collective LSD trip that feels like a flashback to ''Easy Rider,'' the film becomes derailed. By the time the movie comes back on track for a nasty final scene, the game of ''is it or isn't it real'' hide-and-seek has long been lost. 
''Hard Core Logo'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and one scene of violence.

Baker, based on the book by Michael Turner; director of photography, Danny Nowak; edited by Reginald Harkema; music by Schaun Tozer; production designer, David Wilson; produced by Christine Haebler and Brian Dennis; released by Cowboy Booking International in association with Rolling Thunder Pictures.

‽Cannibal! The Musical‽,‽Try to arrive a few minutes late for ''Cannibal: The Musical.'' That way you'll miss the revolting sight of bloody, amputated body parts, the trademarks of Troma, the filmmakers who gave the world ''The Toxic Avenger'' and ''Surf Nazis Must Die!'' After the gory first scene, the movie is not completely appalling. 
''Cannibal! The Musical,'' which was completed in 1994, is making it into theaters now largely because of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the young creators of ''South Park,'' Comedy Central's animated series about third graders and four-letter words. Mr. Parker wrote, directed and stars in the film. Mr. Stone plays a prospector and is one of the producers. Their work here is still amateurish but has flashes of real humor. 
The film is inspired by the true story of Alferd Packer (Mr. Parker), an 1870's gold prospector, and how he came to be convicted of cannibalism.  In the beginning, Alferd is a happy-go-lucky guy who loves his horse, Leanne, and just being alive, as you can tell from the lyrics of his first song: ''The sky is blue and all the leaves are green. The sun's as warm as a baked potato.'' A few lines later, he sings, ''My heart's as full as a baked potato.'' 
The men he travels with from Utah to Colorado are not a particularly bright or tough bunch. When they meet a group of trappers, they're horrified to learn that trapping involves killing little animals. When a man gets unruly, he's sentenced to a 20-minute ''time out.'' When they come across the Grand Canyon, one says: ''We'll just walk around it. It can't be that big.'' When they run into a band of ''Indians'' who are clearly Japanese, they don't notice anything unusual. 
Along the way, before the cannibalism, they build a snowman, encounter a Confederate cyclops and pursue a horse thief. Alferd tells his story to pretty Polly Prye (Toddy Walters), a sympathetic listener who turns out to be a reporter for The Denver Post. 
This all leads up to a huge musical number in which the jubilant townspeople dance and sing in the streets about the joys of watching a hanging. (A typical line: ''When his tongue rolls out, we'll know.'') 
It's all pretty stupid, but at times, there are refreshingly ludicrous notes that even people old enough to see this movie without a guardian can appreciate. One approach: Imagine the film taking place in ''South Park'' animation. If Cartman were ripping that man's arm off and eating it, it might be cute. 
CANNIBAL!

‽Talk to Me‽,‽Betty and Veronica are the focal females of ''Talk to Me,'' but the action is far from the teen-age angst of Archie Comics. 
''Talk to Me'' may have been made in 1996, but it is very much at home in 1998 because it revolves around telephone sex. 
In this amiable, modest romantic comedy opening today at the Quad Cinema, Betty and Veronica are facing the dread age of 30, and the romantic lives of these New Yorkers are not in the best of shape. 
Betty hasn't had sex in nine months. Veronica, or Ronnie as she is known, is still dating Stuart even though they have broken up because he said he wasn't ready for marriage. 
So one night Betty (Cheryl Clifford) succumbs to the temptation to dial the ''900'' number of the Universe of Love (''Tired of being judged before a person can get to know the real you?''), and soon she finds herself smitten with the voice of a young man named Arnold Dowling (Peter Welch). 
And not long after that, they are involved in a private telephonic chat, shucking off clothes and acting out a fantasy about a cleaning woman in a blue uniform, a white apron and high heels and some sudsy water. 
But Arnold, it seems, has a problem, which his brother Michael (Gary Navicoff), a psychiatrist, is trying to address. Arnold, an architect, has been traumatized by a devastating office romance. After a year, without warning, Maggie, Arnold's love, turned up one day wearing another man's engagement ring. 
What he cannot stand, therefore, is a liar, and what he has not yet discovered is that the woman he knows on the telephone only as Miranda is actually Betty. 
Well, one day Betty will actually track down the reticent Arnold, and they will have a date, which will lead to complications. And in the meantime, Veronica (Elizabeth Landis), will also decide to let her fingers do the trolling, which leads her into the lair and limo of the suave Frederick (Ralph Romeo). 
George Esguerra, who produced and directed ''Talk to Me'' and wrote the screenplay with Robert Foulkes, displays a nice understanding of the scars of the dating game, the difficulties of the mating game, the uses of guises and the elements of human comedy. ''Talk to Me'' holds no special surprises and reaches no heights of hilarity, but Betty and Arnold prove to be the sort of decent people who deserve a happy ending. 
TALK TO ME

At the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village. Running time: 87 minutes. This film is not rated.

‽My Mother's Courage‽,‽Holocaust dramas tend to be so relentlessly grim that ''My Mother's Courage,'' a smart, unsettling comedy edged with horror about a plucky Hungarian woman who narrowly escapes deportation to Auschwitz, requires a sharp adjustment of perspective. The tone of the film, which goes out of its way to avoid the customary solemnity surrounding its subject, veers unpredictably between warmhearted humor and savage irony. 
Based on true experiences of the mother of the Hungarian playwright George Tabori, the film was written and directed by Michael Verhoeven, whose acclaimed films ''The Nasty Girl'' and ''The White Rose'' also deal with Europe's Nazi past. ''My Mother's Courage'' maintains a semblance of realism until Mr. Tabori  himself pops up in a crowd scene and momentarily suspends the action. From that point on, the movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, never feels the same. 
As vivid fantasies and flashbacks abruptly intrude, the movie moves in and out of the self-protective reverie of its likable main character, a sheltered middle-class woman who can barely comprehend the horror into which she is briefly plunged. That nightmare begins on a hot summer afternoon in 1944 while Elsa (Pauline Collins), whose husband, a newspaper editor, is already in prison, is  strolling on the streets of Budapest. Two elderly policemen approach Elsa, and with an attitude of apologetic courtliness put her in handcuffs and escort her to a trolley that carries her to a crowded railroad station. 
Here she finds herself milling among hundreds of other Jews from the city who have been rounded up for deportation. But because the disposition of Budapest's Jews was conducted in secrecy and elaborate deceit, many were led to believe they would be relocated to Sweden. The atmosphere at the station is grotesquely anticipatory, almost festive. Even after the prisoners are harshly pushed into boxcars, a lingering optimism prevails. 
Instead of focusing on the terror and degradation, these scenes view the world through the innocent, still-trusting eyes of a woman who, despite having to wear a star identifying her as Jewish, has remained oblivious to the warning signs. The film finds an uncomfortable, absurdist humor in the spectacle of these doomed deportees behaving with such docile obedience in the face of their murderers. 
Elsa, whom Ms. Collins plays with a warm, watchful intensity, is a prototypical innocent whose naivete becomes a kind of protective armor. Even after she has been crammed into a boxcar, she remains stalwartly calm, offering comfort and hope to a young woman (Natalie Morse) who was brutally raped and routed from her home by green-shirted Nazis. Peering through the cracks in the train, she has memories of her idyllic childhood. 
Elsa's salvation is almost accidental. After the prisoners are unloaded in the countryside and herded to a filthy storage barn to wait for another train, Elsa is goaded by a fellow prisoner to protest her innocence. She finds herself pushed into a courtyard where she approaches the presiding officer (Ulrich Tukur) and improvises an excuse about a safe conduct pass she left at home. Either because he feels a mysterious connection to Elsa or out of sheer contrariness, he orders her returned to Budapest in his first-class compartment. On the trip back, her savior, a strict vegetarian, regales her with a gruesome story of human flesh-eating and revenge. 
''My Mother's Courage'' draws no moral conclusions about Elsa's deliverance. As she emerges from her ordeal, it remains a blip of unimaginable horror that will take a lifetime for her to assimilate.

‽The Bloody Child‽,‽Mixing extreme naturalism with surreal reveries and disembodied voices distractedly chattering jump-rope rhymes and fragments from ''Macbeth,'' Nina Menkes's eerie experimental film ''The Bloody Child'' demands a great deal of patience for it to weave its depressing spell. But once you surrender to the rhythm of its maddeningly repeated images and its laborious accretion of somber detail, the movie offers a suffocating vision of American military life as a lethal social malignancy. 
Much of the movie, which opens today at Anthology Film Archives,  was filmed in the vicinity of America's largest Marine base, at Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., in the Mojave Desert. The film, which uses real military personnel, also drops in on local country-and-western bars to observe the rowdy behavior of marines off duty. Additional scenes evoking the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath were shot in northeastern Africa. 
The kernel of the story traces and retraces the arrest of a marine after the brutal murder of his wife. But instead of indicting the thick-necked suspect, who is photographed only from the side and the back, the movie compiles a devastating portrait of the soul-deadening milieu in which the crime took place. 
Scenes of the arrest shot from a distance that leaves much of the dialogue inaudible show the marine,  who was caught trying to bury his wife in the desert before sunrise, being arrested and thrown in the back of a car. 
Now and then, the monotonous litany of officialese is jarringly broken with a sudden close-up of a military policeman shoving the marine's face into his dead wife's bloody lap and barking an obscenity. Tinka Menkes,  the film maker's sister, plays a marine captain who struggles to maintain an attitude of composure during the arrest. 
Overlaying these hypernaturalistic scenes are evocations of the slain woman's spirit intoning nonsense rhymes in a high girlish voice. There are visions of a naked woman covered with white powder, sprawled in the woods and writing mysterious signs on her arm. 
Finally, there is the appearance of a riderless black stallion on the crime scene. 
What does it all mean? Allusive, haunting and at moments almost intolerably dull, ''The Bloody Child'' leaves it to us to connect the dots of its pointedly feminist vision of hell on  earth. It is a macho thing.

‽Sleepover‽,‽Anyone who grew up in a middle-class American suburb and itched to be one of the in-crowd should feel an uncomfortable twinge of recognition while watching John Sullivan's debut film, ''Sleepover.'' This microscopic study of adolescent summertime angst in a Connecticut coastal town follows a group of bored teen-agers as they embark on a midnight outing that leads to catastrophe. 
Few movies have captured the intricacies of adolescent peer pressure more tellingly. With characters ranging from 14 to 18, ''Sleepover,'' which opens today at the Anthology Film Archives, observes how gradations of age and experience determine a ruthless teen-age pecking order. The youngest and most naive obligingly endure the contempt of the more sophisticated in order to learn how to follow in their footsteps. 
The leader of the group, Mark (Michael Albanese), is an insecure, hormonally fueled troublemaker driven by a nagging rage that could turn him into a criminal in the not-too-distant future. His companions include his haughty date, Brooke (Heather Casey); his much-abused sidekick, Sean (Karl Giant); two younger girls, Megan (Megan Shand) and Anne (Shannon Barry), and a black youth, Ken (Ken Miles), who is new to the area and whom Mark insistently race-baits. 
A movie that begins as a wispy slice of teen-age life builds into an unsettling portrait of a bully whose domineering behavior, recklessness and compulsive cruelty begin to alienate his friends. Mark brings whisky (and Brooke, marijuana) to the group's midnight party under a bridge, where Mark comes close to accidentally drowning Brooke after coercing her into sex. Afterward, she forgives him much too easily. 
Mark and Brooke represent every high-school couple drawn to each other by good looks who put on a show of bravado for themselves as much as for their companions. Sean is the class nerd who endures Mark's indignities in order to bask in his tormentor's macho glamour. When Megan loses her virginity to Sean, the reason seems to be curiosity and internalized peer pressure more than any burning attraction. 
How does one survive adolescence? Well, as ''Sleepover'' shows, in a sequence that recalls the endings of the French New Wave classics ''Jules and Jim'' and ''Contempt,'' some don't.

‽
‽Margaret's Museum‽,‽With a strong and colorful sense of its Nova Scotia setting, ''Margaret's Museum'' describes life in a remote coal mining community. It's an existence that the film's reckless, earthy heroine knows all too well. Rough-hewn Margaret MacNeil, played spiritedly by Helena Bonham Carter, has lost a father and brother to ''the pit,'' as the miners call it. And she works as a scrubwoman in the village hospital. Periodically throughout the film, which is set in the late 1940's and early 1950's, alarm bells sound as the hospital staff braces for new accident victims from underground. 
Growing up in this atmosphere has left Margaret wary of men. But the film involves her in a sweetly offbeat courtship once she meets Neil Currie (Clive Russell), a gentle soul who speaks Gaelic, plays the bagpipes and nicely embodies this film's quirky charm. (Heard on the soundtrack: traditional Scottish and Irish melodies with names like ''Jenny's Chickens,'' ''Boy's Lament for His Dragon'' and ''The Wedding Reel.'') 
Neil is also the namesake of Sheldon Currie, a professor of English who grew up in a mining family on isolated Cape Breton Island and eventually wrote the stories on which Mort Ransen's film is based. The relative popularity of ''Margaret's Museum'' in Canada owes a lot to the film's novelistic eye for Cape Breton, thanks to the author's keen evocation of his childhood home. 
Beyond its picturesque aspects, the film means to decry the hardships that the miners endure. The title image is a reference to their suffering, and it starts the film on a macabre note. A couple of tourists stop at Margaret's house, and when the woman sees the bathroom, she runs away screaming. What's in there? It's Margaret's form of protest against atrocious mining conditions. Still, if you're not Wes Craven, you may not want to know. 
Mr. Ransen directs this scene as an unsteady mix of horror and slapstick, which hardly bodes well for the rest of the story. But after this bizarre opening, ''Margaret's Museum'' slowly begins working its wiles. Ms. Carter so thoroughly shakes off her usual refinement that she plays this first scene in a flour sack looking like Little Orphan Annie. But she brings a headstrong exuberance to her wild, rebellious role. Mr. Russell, who stoops his 6-foot-6-inch frame down toward tiny Margaret as he beguiles her, makes himself a surprisingly romantic presence in Margaret's otherwise humdrum life. 
''Margaret's Museum'' surrounds Margaret and Neil with a solid set of supporting characters rather than embroiling them in a vigorous plot. (It remains clear that the characters come from separate short stories of Mr. Currie's.) The standout is Catherine MacNeil, Margaret's widowed mother, played by Kate Nelligan with a deadpan, caustic wit. ''I'm sure you'll be happy or miserable, as the case may be,'' Catherine says, by way of congratulating Neil and Margaret when they marry. ''Fair enough?'' 
Also floating through the film and flirting dangerously with life in the pit are Margaret's staunch Uncle Angus (Kenneth Welsh) and her impressionable young brother, Jimmy (Craig Olejnik), who finds himself dangerously attracted to the daughter of the mine's owner. In a company town full of debts to the company store, this isn't liable to work to Jimmy's advantage. 
Meanwhile, he must also contend with the determination of Catherine and Margaret to keep him out of the mine at any price. Jimmy's grandfather has such advanced black-lung disease that he needs to be whacked  on the back periodically to keep him breathing. 
Using music, wry anecdotes and hefty jugs of moonshine to capture the village atmosphere, ''Margaret's Museum,'' which opens today at the Quad, contrasts Margaret's craving for freedom with the grief she feels closing in. The film's sense of tragedy is as simple as a folk song's, but its hearty resilience is what makes it worth remembering. 
''Margaret's Museum'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief nudity, mild profanity and discreet sexual situations.

‽Nightjohn‽,‽Lest we forget, knowledge is power, and for slaves in the antebellum South, learning to read was forbidden. Some slaves who dared to become literate were punished by having a finger chopped off in front of the whole slave community. Or worse. 
Charles Burnett's powerful made-for-television film, ''Nightjohn,'' which was first shown on the Disney Channel last June, remembers those days through the voice of a motherless 12-year-old girl named Sarny (Allison Jones), who defies the law.  ''Nightjohn,'' which was based on a book by Gary Paulsen, opens a seven-film series of Mr. Burnett's work that begins today at the Walter Reade Theater and continues through Feb. 13. 
Although narrated in the simple, straightforward style of a typical family movie and filmed with a picture-book prettiness, ''Nightjohn'' is no cop-out when it comes to confronting the day-to-day horrors of slavery. Its representative slave owner, Clel Waller (Beau Bridges), is a conscienceless brute who terrorizes his field workers with beatings and humiliations and bullies his squeamish young son, Jeffrey (Joel Thomas Traywick), into following his example. 
Sarny's tutor is Nightjohn (Carl Lumbly), a rebellious slave purchased on the cheap who escaped to the North but returned to the South on a secret mission to teach slaves to read, no matter what the consequences. Sarny proves to be his brightest pupil, and when her literacy is discovered, she uses it to outwit her owner. Beautifully acted, with a superb teleplay by Bill Cain, the film  has the resonance of a classic fable. 
Presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in association with the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, the Burnett series honors the work of one of America's major black film makers, who made an astonishing debut in 1977 with ''Killer of Sheep,'' his neo-realist portrait of a Los Angeles meat packer. (That film has screenings today at 4 and 8:15 P.M.) 
Over the next two weeks ''Nightjohn'' will have 13 screenings, including today at 2 and 6:15 P.M., tomorrow at 6:30 P.M. and Sunday at 6:15 P.M. The Walter Reade Theater is at 165 West 65th Street, at the plaza level of Lincoln Center. Tickets are $8; $5 for Film Society members; $4 for the elderly at weekday matinees.

‽The Whole Wide World‽,‽When a young man points to the horizon and crows to his date that he ordered up a magnificent sunset just for her, you know you are not in the 1990's but back in some innocent long-ago, eons before the Weather Channel turned climatology into couch-potato entertainment. ''The Whole Wide World,'' which includes more than one such florid declaration, is set in the mid-1930's, in West Texas, to be precise. 
The character doing the ordering is Robert E. Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio), the pulp fiction writer best known for creating Conan the Barbarian. His companion is Novalyne Price (Renee Zellweger), whose 1985 memoir, ''One Who Walked Alone,''  from which the film was adapted, remembers her stormy friendship with Robert, who died by his own hand at the age of 30. 
Wonderfully acted by Mr. D'Onofrio and Ms. Zellweger, the movie, directed by Dan Ireland, is a deep, gently touching study of the relationship between two strong-willed individuals with big dreams and plenty of open sky under which to call them up. Novalyne, an aspiring writer, is a salty, down-to-earth young schoolteacher with a restless heart who knows how to stand up for herself. Ms. Zellweger, memorable in in ''Jerry Maguire,'' gives the character a blunt, twangy authenticity. 
Robert is a self-absorbed fantasist whose lurid adventure yarns are his escape from a world in which he doesn't fit. Inside the drab rural farmhouse where he lives with his  ailing mother and incommunicative father, he conjures up a make-believe life of heroic derring-do and  erotic adventure that shocks Novalyne's puritanical sensibility. 
The movie follows a volatile relationship that involves dates for movies like ''The 20th Century'' and that reaches its peak in an impulsive and dramatic kiss on a windswept bluff. The relationship begins to dissolve after Robert announces with characteristic grandiosity that he is not the sort of man to be tied down, and Novalyne, quite sensibly, draws back and begins dating someone else. 
Where films about writers tend to shy away from examining the creative process, ''The Whole Wide World'' finds comedy in Robert's intense involvement with the typewriter. The first time Novalyne visits him at his home, she hears him from  afar excitedly bellowing the words he is committing to paper. Scenes like these evoke the adrenaline rush that every writer feels during a creative streak when words and images are clicking into sentences and paragraphs. But the difference between almost every other writer and Robert is in the degree of his passion. Instead of finding a comfortable energy level and flowing with it, he becomes maniacally carried away. 
The movie's view of this disturbed young author finds just the right balance between affection and pity, admiration and criticism. Robert is a mama's boy under the spell of a seductive, sickly mother (Ann Wedgeworth) who is slowly wasting away from an unidentified illness. His slavish devotion, at once selfless and neurotically dependent, exacts a steep psychological price, and he is prone to violent tantrums. In the film's most unsettling scene, he becomes so enraged when his car won't start that he grabs a knife, rushes into a cornfield and furiously slashes away at everything in sight. 
But in Mr. D'Onofrio's finely shaded performance, Robert is as much a charmer as he is a problem child. He has a winning streak of gallantry,  and his enthusiasm and mental energy can be dazzling. 
''The Whole Wide World'' focuses so intently on Novalyne and Robert's friendship that it pays only cursory attention to the world around them. The other people in their lives are shadowy fringe figures. For all the characters' tumult, the emotional journey that the movie follows feels somewhat flat. When, at the very end, the tone of the film turns stickily sentimental, you can feel the movie awkwardly trying to sum itself up with a grand gesture. 
But how many movies have you seen lately that portray a complicated relationship between intelligent young adults exchanging thoughts about life and art who really listen to each other? ''The Whole Wide World'' does exactly that, and it's no mean feat. 
''The Whole Wide World'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There's some mildly salty language.

‽Some Mother's Son‽,‽Nothing in a recent film captures with more devastating force the perilous atmosphere of life during wartime than an early scene from ''Some Mother's Son.'' As the fresh-faced uniformed students at a Roman Catholic girls' school in Northern Ireland rehearse an elaborate step-dancing routine, a bomb explodes outside the classroom, smashing windows and inciting pandemonium where discipline and calm had prevailed an instant before. 
Helen Mirren, in one of the juiciest roles of her career, plays Kathleen Quigley, a widowed, stubbornly apolitical teacher in the school who is unaware that her son Gerard (Aidan Gillen) is one of the Irish Republican Army members who set off the blast. The scene in which this dashing, spirited young man borrows his mother's car under false pretenses and matter-of-factly wreaks destruction with his accomplices is one of the film's many disquieting moments. 
Kathleen's willful innocence is soon shattered during a Christmas dinner when police officers burst into her home and arrest Gerard as one of the bombers. Suddenly a woman who assiduously shunned the political fray in Northern Ireland finds herself in the thick of it. 
''Some Mother's Son,'' written and directed by Terry George, might loosely be described as the sequel to ''In the Name of the Father,'' the much-admired 1993 film for which he wrote the screenplay. For this film, Jim Sheridan, who directed ''In the Name of the Father,'' has ascended to the role of producer (one of three). 
The new film, which like its predecessor is based on fact, doesn't have a quirky central character like Gerry Conlon, the young Belfast layabout (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) who was wrongly convicted of being an I.R.A. terrorist and locked up for years. But it is pointedly more partisan in its portrayal of British Government officials as brutal, icy oppressors of a heroic, if tragically overzealous nationalist movement. And it uses film clips of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher damningly against her. 
Focusing on a much more famous real event, a 1981 hunger strike by I.R.A. members in Maze Prison in Belfast that left 10 dead, including the strikers' leader, Bobby Sands, ''Some Mother's Son'' is a more conventional docudrama. It interweaves fact and fiction with the crisp immediacy of a beautifully shot and edited news film. 
Ms. Mirren's character is an Everymother who, before the story ends, is forced to make an agonizing decision about whether to allow her son to die for his cause (which he is more than eager to do) or to interfere and exercise her legal right to save his life. By law, when a hunger striker lapses into a coma, a parent can sign a paper instructing that the striker be force-fed. 
The film parallels Kathleen's journey from apolitical pacifist to placard-waving pro-I.R.A. demonstrator, with that of Annie Higgins (Fionnula Flanagan), a belligerent I.R.A. supporter whose son Frank (David O'Hara) is arrested with Gerard. A stout, redheaded woman of blunt passions, Annie embodies the aggrieved, intransigent soul of Roman Catholic resistance to British rule. Ms. Flanagan's magnificent performance conveys a mixture of ominous militancy and maternal vulnerability that is as compelling as it is utterly believable. 
By contrast, Ms. Mirren scrupulously underplays Kathleen. In a role that could have been milked for tears, Ms. Mirren brings out Kathleen's tense, questioning determination to save her son while following her own political conscience. The character always seems to be anxiously hanging back from a display of feeling. She is too busy absorbing experience to waste time dissolved in grief. Because of their philosophical differences, the solid friendship that develops between the two mothers retains a lurking undercurrent of distrust. 
A good part of the film is devoted to dramatizing events that began in 1976, when the British Government changed its official policy toward jailed I.R.A. members and decided to treat them as criminal terrorists rather than political prisoners. The Irish nationalists refused to put on prison uniforms and donned blankets in protest. After the British retaliated by denying them bathroom privileges, they began smearing the walls of their cells with their excrement. 
In March 1981, Sands (who in the movie is Gerard's cellmate) began the hunger strike that ended 66 days later with his death. Less than a month earlier, he won a narrow victory over a Unionist candidate in a local election that generated furious political passions. His death made him an I.R.A. martyr, and his funeral in Belfast drew 100,000 mourners. 
As the film cuts back and forth between scenes of tight-lipped British officials and prisoners euphorically uniting in solidarity against their captors, you have the queasy sense of a war of nerves spinning out of control. Once the hunger strike is in full swing, the movie doesn't shy away from showing the physical ravages of starvation. 
The scenes in which the prisoners decide to step up their resistance and to die if necessary are at once rousing and extremely sad. While the film gives both Sands (powerfully played by John Lynch) and Gerard a vaguely Christlike aura, it doesn't swooningly give its heart to them. The perspective remains detached enough that one is forced to wonder why this game of lethal tit for tat had to escalate to such crazy extremes. At the same time, it conveys a chilling sense of forces so implacably antagonistic that only a miracle could reconcile their differences. 
''Some Mother's Son'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language and scenes of violence.

‽
‽I'm Not Rappaport‽,‽If anyone can capture the title, still held by W. C. Fields, of the movies' transcendent comic grouch, it is certainly Walter Matthau, who makes another impressive pass at it in the movie version of Herb Gardner's hit Broadway play ''I'm Not Rappaport.'' Every leathery crease, crag and wattle of the most lived-in face in show business attests to the fact that Mr. Matthau has been around for a while and survived some hard knocks. 
It is the face of a man who has earned the right to pine out loud for the good old days and to grumble about the world going to hell in a handbasket. For the typical Matthau misanthrope, theatrical crankiness is more than just a self-affirming shtick; it sets up a protective force field that keeps the demons of despair at bay. 
In ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' Mr. Matthau has one of the richest characters of his career, Nat Moyer, an 81-year-old unreconstructed New York Jewish radical, fantasist and troublemaker. The role, originally played on Broadway by Judd Hirsch, gives Mr. Matthau free rein as a storyteller, verbal pugilist and character actor. 
But Mr. Matthau's wonderfully engaged performance can't conceal the glaring weaknesses of the play, which Mr. Gardner adapted for the screen and also directed and which suffers mightily from its translation into a more realistic medium. ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' which opens today at the Regency Cinema, is essentially an extended two-man vaudeville routine in which Nat and his fellow octogenarian Midge Carter (Ossie Davis), meet on a bench in Central Park and carry on an antagonistic friendship. 
Until Midge calls his bluff, Nat poses as Hernando, a Cuban terrorist. When unmasked, Nat explains darkly that the character is his ''cover story.'' And as the movie slogs along, Nat assumes several other exotic identities, enlisting Midge as his sidekick in reckless, futile efforts to help others out of serious jams. 
When not play-acting in scenarios concocted by Nat, the two friends alternately reminisce and bicker like an old married couple. Midge, who is black, is about to lose his longtime job as superintendent of a building on Central Park West that has just gone co-op. In an elaborate ruse, Nat poses as a feisty lawyer and tries to intimidate Danforth (Boyd Gaines), the yuppie head of the tenants' committee, into keeping Midge on. When Nat's daughter Clara (Amy Irving) shows up in the park and threatens to put him in an old-age home, he invents an entire secret life and an illegitimate daughter in Israel who has offered to care for him. 
Nat's most ambitious scheme involves Laurie (Martha Plimpton), a young woman just out of drug rehabilitation who spends her days in Central Park sketching the scenery. Laurie's artistic idyll ends when her dealer, Cowboy (Craig T. Nelson), catches up with her, slaps her around and demands money she stole from him. Hoping to save Laurie from further abuse and possible murder, Nat and Midge, who have observed the scene from their bench, pay Cowboy a call, posing as a menacing Mafia don and his chauffeur. 
None of it is remotely believable. Although the movie imagines a surreal Central Park (one recurrent image is of an elegantly dressed man doing the tango with a mannequin in front of the Bethesda Fountain), the film fails to evoke the fanciful environmental equivalent of Nat's yarns. Flashbacks to Nat's childhood and recurrent fantasies of a beautiful woman he once saw in a library add a patina of wistfulness without deepening the story. 
Dialogue that aspires to be a down-to-earth New York vaudevillian echo of Samuel Beckett's metaphysical musings swings uneasily between forced whimsy and a treacly sentimentality. And the minor characters are stick figures. Even Mr. Davis's Midge amounts to little more than Nat's handy comic foil. 
But in Mr. Matthau's hands, Nat attains a crusty, cantankerous nobility. His rash, eccentric campaigns against injustice and cruelty are an old man's way of raging against the dying of the light, of trying to make a difference in an indifferent world. It is with an almost vengeful glee that Mr. Matthau brings home the play's message: Imagination is the best defense. 
''I'm Not Rappaport'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has one scene of violence and some strong language. 
I'M NOT RAPPAPORT

‽
‽Hamlet‽,‽Kenneth Branagh's fine, robust performance as Hamlet is the bright centerpiece of his lavish new version of the play. Heading a cast so stellar that majestic Blenheim Palace plays the role of Elsinore, Mr. Branagh holds court throughout a four-hour, 70-millimeter sumptuously appointed production that doesn't often lag. This ''Hamlet,'' like Mr. Branagh's version of ''Much Ado About Nothing,'' takes a frank, try-anything approach to sustaining its entertainment value, but its gambits are most often evidence of Mr. Branagh's solid showmanship. His own performance is the best evidence of all. 
Mr. Branagh remains a great popularizer of Shakespeare and now has the chance to speak some of the most famous lines in the English language as if they had just come to mind. He makes a dashing figure if not a terribly melancholy Dane, typifying this film's preference for bold strokes over gloomy introspection. 
Sometimes resorting freely to unlikely touches, this film has earthquake special effects and a horror-film look when its ghost arrives. There are torrents of confetti when Gertrude weds Claudius, and a final fencing match on a scale that Rocky might envy. In between, the film's many stars parade in velvet and braid through ornate chambers that are built on a cathedral scale. Alex Thomson's cinematography captures this swank atmosphere in all its gilt-edged glory. 
Sometimes this visual bravado can veer toward the absurd, as when the film finds Hamlet in the foreground of a snowy landscape. There's a huge army so far behind him that the lines of soldiers look like computer-generated whiskers. But most of this ''Hamlet'' is shrewder than that, with keen instincts for the essence of the play. The style here is unabashedly flamboyant, but it also works. 
With a cast so big-name and polyglot that it could be assembled almost as reasonably for a celebrity roast, Mr. Branagh still gets dedication to the text, which is presented here in its convoluted, Machiavellian entirety. Of course, when Robin Williams appears late in the relatively minor role of Osric, count on more than the expected number of close-ups to show Osric registering events around him. 
Some of the star turns are here for blatant marquee value and stand out as gratuitous. (Gerard Depardieu and Jack Lemmon, as Reynaldo and Marcellus respectively, are here only briefly and look understandably adrift.) Blink and you'll miss John Gielgud, who has no dialogue as Priam in a flashback role. But other casting ideas work impressively well (Charlton Heston cuts a grandly imposing figure as the Player King) or show worthwhile whimsy. Billy Crystal practically juggles skulls as the gravedigger who speaks of poor Yorick (and Mr. Branagh throws in a flashback shot of little Hamlet being amused by Yorick's clowning). But his presence suits the role and holds the attention. 
Among the play's more important figures, Derek Jacobi stands out as a superb, quietly calculating Claudius, and Julie Christie makes a heart-rending Gertrude. (She looks elegant but is done up to look far older than Mr. Branagh, who himself shows off a flattering blond coiffure and lean costumes with a nicely contemporary look.) As Ophelia, Kate Winslet gives a fervent performance that takes on even more heat thanks to the extra directorial flourish of showing flashback scenes of Hamlet and Ophelia in bed. 
With a huge cast that also includes Judi Dench, Rosemary Harris, Michael Maloney and Richard Briers, ''Hamlet,'' which opens today at the Paris Fine Arts Theater, has an omnibus quality that would waver without such a strong figure in the title role. As star and ringmaster, Mr. Branagh gets to the heart of ''Hamlet'' and goes to admirable lengths to take his audience there, too. 
''Hamlet'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, coarse Anglo-Saxonisms and a brief bedroom scene.

‽
‽The Evening Star‽,‽''The Evening Star,'' the wayward and needless sequel to ''Terms of Endearment,'' is so desperate to touch base with its predecessor that the new story's characters often reach for their scrapbooks to summon memories of the first film's dead heroine. Debra Winger's Emma, available only in snapshots and glowing references, is invoked over and over in a film that has few better ways to spend its time. 
''The Evening Star'' wobbles along for well over two hours and still seems uneventful, since it does little more than watch Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) cope pluckily with her grandmotherly problems.  Aurora, the Dolly Levi of suburban Houston, still has a big retinue of friends, servants and admirers. She also has the three grown children whom Emma left behind, and shepherding them provides many opportunities for cracker-barrel wisdom.  For instance: ''I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a mistake. I think we all create what we need.'' And, ''When you stop trying, you fade away.'' 
Ms. MacLaine cuts a tart, indefatigable figure who seems much tougher and more likable than anything she's given to say. ''The Evening Star,'' written and directed by Robert Harling from Larry McMurtry's weak follow-up to his own novel, surrounds her with a crew of wacky minor characters and lets her flit among them in fairly aimless fashion. Aurora's granddaughter is played by Juliette Lewis, who shouts all her dialogue patronizingly. Ms. Lewis does look dimly enough like Ms. Winger to prompt an ''Oh, she reminds me so much of Emma that it hurts.'' 
It hurts, all right -- especially when Jack Nicholson returns well past this film's 11th hour to join Ms. MacLaine for the brief, awful scene that gives the film its title. As the ex-astronaut Garrett Breedlove, he grandly assures Aurora that her life has ''a kind of perverse majesty'' and points out a similarity between the heroine and the evening star in the cosmos. ''She shines first, she shines brightest and she shines longest,'' Garrett windily intones. 
''Careful, Garrett,'' says Aurora.  ''Your soul is showing.'' 
Then she mentions that Garrett has walked on the moon. ''And you've walked on the earth,'' he declares solemnly. ''That's a nicer place.'' 
''The Evening Star'' also features Scott Wolf in the silly role of the granddaughter's boyfriend, an aspiring underwear model; Bill Paxton as Aurora's therapist, whose affair with his patient isn't especially racy or lively; and Miranda Richardson in the film's one bright, funny turn, playing the divorcee and clotheshorse who becomes Aurora's catty enemy. Marion Ross does a warm, sturdy job as the devoted housekeeper who has been kept too long under Aurora's wing. 
Following up on the first film's formula, ''The Evening Star'' eventually calls for crepe-hanging and tears. Swelling music and studied close-ups pave the way for these outbursts of emotion. A much more honest and touching valedictory note can be found in the performance of Ben Johnson, the courtly cowboy actor with the beautiful voice, who appeared in over 300 films and won a well-deserved Oscar for appearing in ''The Last Picture Show'' as Sam the Lion. He died in April, and ''The Evening Star'' is dedicated to his memory. 
''The Evening Star'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, brief nudity and sexual situations.

‽
‽Michael‽,‽John Travolta may be the only Hollywood star these days who can pull a movie out of a hat and make it dance on the head of a pin. And in Nora Ephron's winsome, wafer-thin comedy, ''Michael,'' his portrayal of a mischievous angel with the appetites of a trucker and the table manners of a 2-year-old puts the film on on its toes and sets it spinning. 
The character, a self-described archangel named Michael who is first encountered by a trio of journalists in an Iowa motel, makes one of the year's more memorable movie entrances. With a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his cumbersome angel wings looking sadly bedraggled, he plows into a bowl of breakfast cereal on which he has heaped enough sugar to send most ordinary mortals into shock. 
With cereal slopping down his stubbly chin, he casually reveals a hairy paunch that has expanded considerably in girth since the actor's buffed-up days of ''Stayin' Alive.'' Michael is, in short, the impishly grinning slob that many of us would like to be if we thought we could get away it. Pure id, with a streak of the practical joker, he also has a redeeming heart of gold. 
Three of the angel's breakfast companions -- Quinlan (William Hurt), Huey (Robert Pastorelli), and Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) -- are representatives of a sleazy tabloid called The National Mirror and have flown all the way from New York, dollar signs dancing in their heads, to see if he's for real. The fourth, Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton), is the motel proprietor who tipped them off. Michael agrees to be interviewed and photographed for a cover story, but not until he has been driven to Chicago. 
The movie follows the foursome and Huey's beloved dog, Sparky (an adorable mutt who happens to have his own byline in The Mirror), on a road trip that begins in Iowa and ends at the foot of the Sears Tower in Chicago. Along the way, Michael insists that they stop off at such zany (and underwhelming) tourist attractions as the World's Largest Ball of Twine. 
But if ''Michael,'' which opens tomorrow, fancies itself a heartwarming hybrid of ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Groundhog Day,'' it never achieves the emotional weight of those classics. The movie is so busy applying cute touches to everything and everybody that it forgets to devote enough attention to the souls Michael has come down to save. 
Mr. Hurt's Quinlan is a grim, cynical journalist who was dismissed from his job at a respectable newspaper after throwing an ill-considered tantrum and has worked for The Mirror ever since. Now he labors under the thumb of an editor who is a bullying maniac (a cartoonishly tyrannical Bob Hoskins). Mr. Hurt conveys an intriguing mixture of bitterness and vulnerability, but his role, as written, is far too thin for his eventual redemption to seem anything more than a ho-hum plot contrivance. Mr. Pastorelli's Huey, a streetwise old-time newspaperman with a big streak of sentimentality, is so underwritten as to barely register. 
Ms. MacDowell's Dorothy is a more complicated failure. A duplicitous corporate climber who pretends to be an expert on angels, she is a bundle of quirks that don't add up. An aspiring country music songwriter, she carries around a notebook in which she scribbles ideas for lyrics. In one of the movie's sweetest moments, she is coaxed onto the stage of a bar to sing and (helped by a little angelic magic from Michael) all her lyrical fragments miraculously coalesce into a funny autobiographical account of her three failed marriages. 
Michael, the celestial rescuer of these lives gone adrift, is far and away the most poignantly human character in the movie. As he explains, angels get to return to earth only so many times, and this is his last go-round. No wonder he is so voracious. Part of that appetite involves women. Michael gives off an irresistible fragrance that is described as smelling like cookies and caramel. And wherever he goes, women instinctively cluster around him like bees to honey. 
The movie handles his sexual magnetism delicately. In the only actual angelic coupling the film records, the voice of the delighted waitress he has picked up for the evening is heard through a motel wall exclaiming: ''Wings? Far out!'' If ''Michael'' does better at the box office than the season's other angelic movie offering, ''The Preacher's Wife,'' it may be because it isn't so prim; it has at least a whiff of sex. 
Like Ms. Ephron's blockbuster hit, ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' ''Michael'' uses pop songs with an unusually astute sense of how to underline a moment. Willie Nelson singing ''What a Wonderful World,'' Bonnie Raitt doing ''Feels Like Home,'' Van Morrison's ''Bright Side of the Road'' and Randy Newman drawling a witty ''Heaven Is My Home'' are among the musical numbers that give the movie a smart pop gloss. 
But it is Mr. Travolta who gives the movie a heart that it probably wouldn't have were any other actor to play the role. Well, yes, maybe Tom Hanks. 
The movie is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has sexual situations that are handled very discreetly. 
MICHAEL 
Directed by Nora Ephron; written by Nora Ephron, Delia Ephron, Pete Dexter and Jim Quinlan, based on a story by Mr. Dexter and Mr. Quinlan; director of photography, John Lindley; edited by Geraldine Peroni; music by Randy Newman; production designer, Dan Davis; produced by Sean Daniel, Ms. Ephron and James Jacks; released by Turner Pictures and New Line Cinema. Running time: 105 minutes. This film is rated PG.

‽
‽Scream‽,‽Having established himself as the best and most mischievous film maker currently working in the dead-babysitter horror genre, Wes Craven (of the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' films) is in the mood for parody. So ''Scream'' winks at everything from a virginal heroine in a flowered cotton nightie to ''the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life for one last scare.'' Along the way, proving it's not too detached to get down to business, ''Scream'' also finds time to disembowel a pretty young victim or two. 
Mr. Craven's characters here are so movie-wise that they sit around swilling beer and eating popcorn while they watch Jamie Lee Curtis flee a crazed killer on the television screen. If this seems cynical, it's meant to; after all, thrill-seeking adolescents are the prime audience for Mr. Craven's brand of titillation. 
But in ''Scream'' he wants things both ways, capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor. Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix. 
For instance, there is the plight of Drew Barrymore in the scary extended sequence with which the glossily well-made ''Scream'' begins. She's alone at night in a big, antiseptically clean house with a lot of windows, and one of the first things she does is put a container of Jiffy Pop on the stove. Then the phone rings. It's a creep. He's a sadist. He taunts her mercilessly until the windows are smashed, the house is a mess and the popcorn is on fire. 
''What do you want?'' she pleads. ''To see what your insides look like!'' he hisses. Sure enough, with her insides hanging out, Ms. Barrymore is eventually found swinging from a tree. It's easy to imagine the film's own teen-age partygoers having a high old time watching this very sequence on home video some day. 
Not much of ''Scream'' is that gruesome. And Mr. Craven does stage this attack with a taste for wry detail (Jiffy Pop?) that sends up the tricks of his gory trade. But when he savors the sight of terrified young girls in tight sweaters, ''Scream'' isn't all that funny, and in any case its brand of humor eventually proves one-note and thin. By the end of ''Scream,'' characters who have argued about whether horror movies are really harmful are being hacked, chopped and otherwise shown that horror can be very harmful indeed. 
The story features a picturesque small town and a clean-cut heroine (Neve Campbell) whose boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich, looking like a younger and more distant Johnny Depp) wants to have sex with her and whose mother died a horrible death. The mother's killer is still at large, and the anniversary of the murder is just around the corner. The principal is played by Henry Winkler and wonders aloud what the next generation is coming to. 
Meanwhile, the high school students talk worriedly about the evil in their midst. ''How do you . . . gut  someone?'' one young woman wants to know. As the schoolmates band together in close proximity to the forces of evil, a brittle, high-powered television reporter (Courteney Cox) shows up to exploit the town's troubles. 
Among the droller touches in ''Scream'' are the killer's mask, which is Edvard Munch by way of a trick-or-treat costume, and suspense scenes set in de rigueur locations like the high school bathroom. There is also an authoritative discussion about the rules of a horror-film party scene by characters who are in fact playing one. To wit: sex equals death in a horror film. Those who drink or take drugs will be killed off, too. And:  ''Never, under any circumstances, say 'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back!' '' But somebody ignores that lesson and winds up attached lifelessly to the garage door. 
''Scream'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sexual references and grisly violence.

‽
‽One Fine Day‽,‽''One Fine Day'' is about great looks, and not only because it stars Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney as one cute twosome. This film also revels in New York City at its touristy best, dashing madly among appealing landmarks all around the town. The list of locations ranges from the ''21'' Club to the Circle Line to Central Park to City Hall and includes the environs of Radio City Music Hall. That's where a big, bright, squeaky-clean romantic comedy of this sort might once have played. 
A 50's romp with a few glaring 90's touches (dueling cellular phones, frazzled single parents), ''One Fine Day'' makes for sunny, pleasant fluff. Both stars are enjoyably breezy, and there's enough chemistry to deflect attention from the story's endless contrivances. The screenplay by Terrel Seltzer and Ellen Simon is full of energetic wisecracks. But it's jokey rather than actually funny most of the time. 
The gimmick here is a single day's adventure that causes Melanie Parker (Ms. Pfeiffer) and Jack Taylor (Mr. Clooney) to meet by chance, argue a lot and then fall in love. They must accomplish this while both their children are home from school, and do it without any help from baby sitters, which keeps the pace frantic much of the time. The story covers a lot of ground without quite losing its by-the-numbers feeling. Maybe all concerned, including the director, Michael Hoffman (''Restoration''), could do this with their eyes closed, but that would mean missing a lot. 
Ms. Pfeiffer, who can seem as substantial as she is gorgeous even in silly roles, plays a workaholic architect with a 5-year-old son. In one of the film's rare real-life moments, she's first seen paying bills at midnight and trying to get a decent night's sleep despite the best efforts of little Sammy (Alex D. Linz). 
The next morning, these two are understandably late for school. So is Maggie (Mae Whitman), the 5-year-old daughter of Jack, a Daily News columnist who is famous enough to have his handsome mug plastered on the side of buses. 
It's hostility at first sight for Melanie and Jack, whose exaggerated feuding is supposed to show how diametrically different they are. She is the stern type, while he's a big kid who loves clowning around. She looks neat and pulled-together until the film douses her with cranberry juice, leaves her standing out in the rain and otherwise calls for a fashion makeover. Meanwhile, he has an attractively rumpled look, either despite or because of the two hair stylists credited with working on Mr. Clooney. 
The film goes to needless lengths to let some of its minor characters coo admiringly about Mr. Clooney. But he's such a natural as a movie star that he hardly needs false flattery. Ms. Pfeiffer, meanwhile, shows a flair for physical comedy (will the tense architect fall down and crush her model buildings?) and has some charming mother-son scenes with little Alex. Both children are effortlessly likable and easily hold up their end of this ensemble comedy. 
Robert Klein has one very funny scene as Mr. Clooney's solemn psychotherapist. There's are also some amusing moments featuring Jon Robin Baitz as the younger of two prospective clients whom Melanie wants to impress. In the newspaper world, Charles Durning oversees Jack's efforts to blow the lid off the mob and the Mayor in a single muckraking story, while Ellen Greene is garish fun as Jack's secret weapon. Jack's competition at The New York Post is played briefly by Pete Hamill, who would now actually be Jack's editor in chief at The Daily News. 
''One Fine Day'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes profanity much too mild to keep children away. 
ONE FINE DAY 
Directed by Michael Hoffman; written by Terrel Seltzer and Ellen Simon; director of photography, Oliver Stapleton; edited by Garth Craven; music by James Newton Howard; production designer, David Gropman; produced by Lynda Obst; released by 20th Century Fox.

WITH: Michelle Pfeiffer (Melanie Parker), George Clooney (Jack Taylor), Mae Whitman (Maggie Taylor), Alex D. Linz (Sammy Parker), Robert Klein (Dr. Martin), Jon Robin Baitz (Yates Jr.) Charles Durning (Lew), Ellen Greene (Elaine Lieberman) and Pete Hamill (Frank Burroughs). 
‽
‽My Fellow Americans‽,‽Is it just coincidence that Jack Lemmon and James Garner, as bickering ex-Presidents in ''My Fellow Americans,'' look a lot like George Bush and Richard Nixon? Probably not. In this funny, farcical spoof of Presidential mediocrity, greed and arrogance, any resemblance to an American statesman living or dead is pure gravy. If the moviegoing public guffawingly laps up the film's bone-deep cynicism, it will be a sign of just how tarnished the nation's highest office has become since Watergate. 
''My Fellow Americans'' (''Grumpy Ex-Presidents'' would have been a more descriptive title) finds the former chief executive Russell P. Kramer (Mr. Lemmon), a Republican, and his longtime Democratic foe, ex-President Matthew Douglas (Mr. Garner), fleeing for their lives. Because of an unwinding political scandal involving their corrupt White House successor, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), certain parties have decided that they should die together in a helicopter crash and be assigned posthumous blame for the new President's glaring ethical lapses. 
Bailing out of the aircraft before it explodes, they find themselves on the lam in the American heartland, dependent for survival on everyday people whose lives they never particularly cared about while they were in the White House. 
There are moments when ''My Fellow Americans,'' directed by Peter Segal and acted with an exhilarating comic gusto by Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Garner, has the makings of a classic American comedy in the Preston Sturges mode, but the screenplay rarely makes the most of them. As the hitchhiking ex-Presidents listen to a truck driver spout historical gibberish confusing Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Davy Crockett, Kramer can't prevent himself from haughtily correcting him, and the pair find themselves summarily ejected from the vehicle. 
Soon after that, they are caught up in a swarm of illegal immigrants fleeing a helicopter pursuit. One Hispanic fugitive pauses long enough to deliver a fervent, misty-eyed speech about his dream of attaining American citizenship. Although these moments offer rich opportunities for pathos and irony, not to mention witty political dialogue, the movie all but throws them away. 
The zaniest sequence finds the duo blundering into a small-town gay pride march and falling in step with a marching band whose members, costumed like cookie-cutter Dorothys from ''The Wizard of Oz,'' are strutting to a martial arrangement of ''Over the Rainbow.'' After being safely escorted from the parade to Cleveland by a cadre of black-leather-clad women on motorcycles, Kramer allows that he was wrong; he should have welcomed gay enlistees into the military. 
Although Kramer and Douglas never did anything illegal while in office, both admit ruefully to having done the politically expedient thing instead of exercising bold leadership. Douglas was a womanizer who regularly took advantage of a secret passage known as ''the Kennedy door'' to spirit women in and out of the  White House. In his retirement, he has been tirelessly flogging a Presidential cookbook. 
Kramer, since leaving office, has shilled for a Japanese insurance company and even danced with a panda at a corporate function. He is also a petty chiseler who, when staying in a fancy hotel, consumes the minibar's supply of vodka, then refills the little bottles with water. A good portion of the dialogue between the two consists of genially traded insults. 
Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Garner are such pros that they carry the movie smoothly over its dull patches. The chemistry between the two pits Mr. Lemmon's pious, sourpussed worrywart against Mr. Garner's expansive, unflappably blithe hedonist. The rest of the cast has little more than walk-on roles. Mr. Aykroyd's President is a myopic dolt, and John Heard's Vice President is a caricature of Dan Quayle (who smugly pronounces facade ''fakade''). Everett McGill is a diabolical Army colonel so absurdly villainous that he seems to have stepped out of a Nazi melodrama. 
''My Fellow Americans,'' doesn't get to the heart of any issue, constitutional, legislative or otherwise. But it has a fine time imagining our leaders as bumbling, thin-skinned, ultimately likable misfits who are as lost on the American highway as everybody else. 
''My Fellow Americans'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some of the insults exchanged get pretty salty.

‽
‽Beavis and Butt-Head Do America‽,‽''Beavis and Butt-head Do America,'' the nastily amusing feature film debut of those tittering, pig-snorting MTV cartoon groundlings, finds the duo coping with the worst of all possible fates: the theft of their precious television set. Unable to soak in music videos from morning till night, and unable to sleep without the drone of television to lull them, America's most libidinous couch potatoes leap at the first job opportunity that presents itself. 
When a sinister thug named Muddy hires them to fly to Las Vegas and ''do'' his ex-wife, Dallas, for $10,000, they fail to realize that ''doing'' someone in Muddy's vocabulary isn't the same thing as doing someone in theirs. It won't be long, these chronically dateless dodos gloatingly assure each other, until they are virgins no more. 
Beavis and Butt-head, who first mooned their way into American living rooms three years ago, might just be the ultimate symptoms of the decline of Western civilization via television. Then again, they just might not. 
There is something (dare one use the word?) reassuring about these nincompoops, who are cruder and geekier than their most loutish fans. As they snicker their way through adventures that take them from Las Vegas to the White House by way of Hoover Dam, the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park, Beavis and Butt-head reveal a geographical ignorance that is stunning enough to make the most learning-challenged junior high school student feel like an Einstein. 
But what gives Beavis and Butt-head some claim to universality isn't their smug stupidity as much as a hormonal desperation so acute that when they find themselves on a tour bus filled with nuns, Butt-head exclaims, 'Hey, Beavis! We're on a bus with chicks!'' They distill the agony of adolescence, the queasy feeling of being trapped in a body going through monstrous changes, at the same time that they purge it of its terror. 
As resilient as Punch and Judy, as unshakably optimistic as Candide, they are myopically self-absorbed to the point that they are incapable of embarrassment. Their most excruciating humiliations are only minor setbacks in a continually frustrated quest for the juicy sex that their beloved music-videos teach them should be as abundant as sunshine. 
''Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' has the same double vision as the MTV series from which it is spun. It views the world simultaneously through the porcine eyes of its characters and through the cooler perspective of their creator and cartoon voice, Mike Judge. If the movie is any reflection of Mr. Judge's personality, he is a cynical, wised-up version of them, a slickie who knows how to ''score'' with women and who has imbibed enough smart drinks to translate his characters' instinctual nihilism into sleek cartoon imagery and trendy sound bites. 
As the duo make their way from New York to Las Vegas to Washington, they wreak havoc everywhere they go but still end up being honored by a cartoon Bill Clinton dispensing drippy platitudes. The disasters they create, and for which they miraculously escape blame, include the worst car pile-up in the history of superhighway mishaps and a devastating flood. 
The movie gleefully thumbs its nose at anyone who pretends to be grown-up, from the President on down. There is the little old lady who plies Beavis with the ''No-Drowz'' caffeine pills that bring out his obnoxiously scatological alter ego. There is the high school principal who expels the pair for trying to steal a television from the school's audiovisual lab and whom the pair discover being spanked by a prostitute. There is the hippy-dippy high school teacher who leads his students in a ludicrous folk-singing ode to a lesbian seagull. 
Finally, there is the country's chief investigator (Robert Stack), who sets a flock of armed Federal agents on their trail and grimly orders ''full cavity searches'' of everyone who has crossed their paths. 
By the time Beavis and Butt-head have ended their cross-country tour and many searches have been conducted, America has definitely been done, and in more ways than one. 
''Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Although the dialogue has no profanity, it is loaded with sexual and scatological double-entendres. 
BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA 
Directed by Mike Judge; written by Mr. Judge and Joe Stillman, based on ''MTV's Beavis and Butt-head,'' created by Mr. Judge; animation director, Yvette Kaplan; music score by John Frizzell; produced by Abby Terkuhle; released by Paramount Pictures.

‽
‽Carla's Song‽,‽It's hard to imagine a more unlikely visitor to Central America in wartime than George (Robert Carlyle), an unemployed Scottish bus driver who is astounded to find himself in mortal peril jouncing along a rutted mountain road in Nicaragua with a group of soldiers dressed in camouflage. It is 1987, when right-wing contras are waging a guerrilla war against the leftist Sandinista Government, and George has impulsively flown all the way from Glasgow with his Nicaraguan fiancee Carla (Oyanka Cabezas) on a risky quest that could turn out to be a wild-goose chase. 
George's culture shock and political awakening form the emotional core of Ken Loach's angry and sorrowful film ''Carla's Song,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinema. This intermittently powerful film, directed from a screenplay by Paul Laverty, is never quite sure of what kind of movie it wants to be. In its early scenes, which have a documentary-like realism, it appears to be a microscopic examination of the life of a discontented city worker whose chafing at the rules of his job have an unexpectedly shattering effect on his life. Later, it becomes a somewhat unwieldy allegory in which the search for a casualty of war assumes Conradian allegorical overtones. 
The bus driver's journey into a strange new life begins when he takes pity on a mysterious passenger who is being harassed by the police for not paying her fare. George's resistance, along with other small acts of rebellion, cause him to be dismissed from his seemingly secure job. And when he befriends and falls in love with the passenger he defended, a beautiful Nicaraguan refugee named Carla who dances in the streets to raise money for the Sandinista cause, the rigid moorings of his life become untethered. 
Carla, whom Ms. Cabezas portrays with a quicksilver intensity that cuts against acting cliches, turns out to be a lot more trouble than George had bargained for. Suffering from post-traumatic stress, she is suicidal. As bits and pieces of her story emerge, George becomes convinced that the only way she can conquer her demons is to return to Nicaragua to find a former lover and fellow Sandinista named Antonio, who was caught and tortured by the contras and who has since disappeared. 
At this point, ''Carla's Song'' lurches boldly but unsteadily into a hybrid of quasi documentary, angry political tract and turgid fable. Abruptly moving from Glasgow to Nicaragua, the movie plunges you into the state of dazed bewilderment that George experiences in his first few days abroad. And in the not terribly believable figure of Bradley (Scott Glenn), a hard-boiled former C.I.A. operative who is now a conscience-stricken worker for a human rights organization, it also gives the movie its blunt political mouthpiece. 
A former enemy turned advocate of the Sandinista cause, and a witness to unspeakable C.I.A.-sponsored atrocities, Bradley is bursting with secrets, most of which are withheld until the end of the film. It turns out he knows where the elusive Antonio is living. The movie wastes valuable time withholding information to build up a bogus head of suspense that turns out not to have been justified once the ugly but unsurprising facts are revealed. 
''Carla's Song'' is at its most effective in scenes that feel semi-improvised, in which George breaks through the barriers of language and culture to establish a warm camaraderie with Sandinista soldiers and peaceful villagers who are under attack from the contras. Its portrait of an idealistic peasant-based army and its supporters standing up to a ruthless enemy is unabashedly nostalgic for the leftist dream the Sandinistas once represented. 
CARLA'S SONG

‽
‽The Hanging Garden‽,‽The drama of an urbane gay man returning to the provinces to confront the ghosts of his troubled youth is such a familiar scenario that it hardly bears repeating. But Thom Fitzgerald's film ''The Hanging Garden,'' which veers wildly between harrowing kitchen-sink realism and surreal fantasy, adds enough bizarre touches (including the naming of its characters after various herbs and flowers) to this version of the prodigal son parable that it reinvents the formula. 
One unsettling message conveyed by the Canadian film is that no matter how drastically you may overhaul your physical image, beneath your bright and shiny new shell, a wounded, frightened child still lurks. All you have to do to find him is go home again. As the movie skips around in time and shows its grown-up characters observing their younger selves, it suggests that as we grow up we become like redwood trees: all the layers of our lives down to our very cores exist at the same time. 
When the film's main character, Sweet William (Chris Leavins), visits his Nova Scotia family for the first time in 10 years, this formerly obese teen-ager is so svelte as to be hardly recognizable. No sooner has he returned for the wedding of his older sister Rosemary (Kerry Fox) than he begins seeing younger versions of himself, including the suicidally inclined 350-pound teen-ager (played with a sullen poker-faced dignity by Troy Veinotte) that he used to be. 
The home to which William returns is a rats' nest of bitterness, illness and domestic violence and the wedding itself a chaotic, drunken affair. The bride, on her way to the ceremony, mutters a stream of angry curses. After the wedding, the groom (Joel S. Keller) on whom the teen-age William had a serious crush, makes a pass at the man who once adored him. 
In the middle of the ceremony, William's fanatically religious grandmother, Grace (Joan Orenstein), who suffers from Alzheimer's, shouts crazily out of the window of her attic sick room. By the end of the afternoon, his father, Whiskey Mac (Peter MacNeill), a gardener, has passed out. Hours later, William's long-suffering mother, Iris (Seana McKenna), simply disappears. At the wedding, William also meets and bonds with Violet (Christine Dunsworth), a frisky, tomboyish little girl who is introduced as his younger sister but who is not what she seems to be. 
Some of the movie's strongest moments evoke the excruciating tension and claustrophobia of growing up in a dysfunctional family. A scene in which Whiskey Mac brutally lashes out and smacks his teen-age son while Iris watches helplessly, barely containing her rage, is so harsh it makes you wince. So is another flashback, in which Iris, alarmed by her teen-age son's recently discovered homosexual tendencies, drags him to the home of a prostitute to be sexually initiated and waits outside the bedroom, listening to the creak of bedsprings, until the deed is done. 
''The Hanging Garden'' is powerfully acted, but its wild gyrations of tone never find a stylistic equilibrium. If the wedding is staged as a black comic farce, other scenes, including a fantasy in which the teen-age William hangs himself in the backyard, have a mawkishly self-pitying undertone. And there are many moments when the lines between fantasy and realism, between farce and drama seem unnecessarily hazy. 
''The Hanging Garden'' suggests that what's called the bosom of the family is rarely a soft and comforting home in which to nestle. It's much more likely to be a bitter cul de sac in which the best defense is a timely escape. 
''The Hanging Garden'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanity.

‽Oscar and Lucinda‽,‽Without doubt, there is no more eccentric story to be found on-screen right now that ''Oscar and Lucinda,'' in which love, glass, Christianity and gambling somehow collide. As directed exquisitely by Gillian Armstrong in a headstrong spirit that recalls her debut feature, ''My Brilliant Career,'' this elliptical tale makes up in visual beauty whatever it lacks in universal meaning. 
Which is a lot, given the quirkiness of Peter Carey's Booker Prize-winning novel. The book's descriptive elegance and richly peculiar imagination would give the film a pedigree like that of ''The English Patient'' even without the presence of Ralph Fiennes, but this tale is much more remote. With the singularity of what might be a real family history, it lets a present-day male narrator tell of Oscar Hopkins (Mr. Fiennes) and Lucinda Leplastrier (Cate Blanchett), kindred spirits who shaped that narrator's ancestral past. Also vital to the story of his creation are a glass church and a bet on whether it can be moved from Sydney to the remote north of Australia. 
Red-haired, bashful Oscar is birdlike and shy, having been cowed early in life by a punitively devout father who disapproves even of such indulgences as Christmas dessert. (''Dear God,'' the boy prays, ''if it be Thy will that people eat pudding, smite him!'') Lucinda, equally delicate in her own way, is also an heiress who becomes fascinated with the manufacture of glass. (As I said, this is one odd story.) 
Before they meet, each has become addicted to gambling, although Oscar's eventual career as an Anglican minister does make it difficult for him to find suitable outlets. But this is a film whose offbeat charms include the sight of clergymen betting about whether a tablecloth can be yanked sharply without anything on the table spilling. In their own way, once they meet and develop an instant affinity, Oscar and Lucinda find winsomely unexpected ways to gamble on life and love. 
While Ms. Armstrong tells the long, rambling story of her characters with more than enough vigor to sustain interest, the film's most extraordinary aspect is its wonderfully luxuriant look. Gorgeously photographed by Geoffrey Simpson (''Shine''), it offers a steady supply of visual surprises within compositions quite suitable for framing. Making rhapsodic use of natural light and of carefully chosen objects, this is a film that can find something gorgeous even in a boatload of cauliflower. Other strong visual assets are Luciana Arrighi's production designs, which lavishly transport the story from England to Australia, and the spectacular costumes by Janet Patterson (''The Piano,'' ''The Portrait of a Lady''). The film often revels in its heroine's vivid personality by crowning her with something like a strikingly embroidered fez. 
Ms. Blanchett, whose strength and vivacity recall the young Judy Davis of ''My Brilliant Career,'' is appealingly well teamed with Mr. Fiennes, who manages to make Oscar as bashfully likable as he is quaint. Despite the story's various sidetracks (involving Ciaran Hinds as another clergyman who admirers Lucinda, and Tom Wilkinson, who will forevermore be remembered for ''The Full Monty''), the film's essential sweetness and mystery come from two lonely people and the cosmic roll of the dice that brings them together. 
''Oscar and Lucinda'' is rated R. It includes profanity, much repressed longing and a sexual interlude.

‽
‽An American Werewolf in Paris‽,‽Why would three red-blooded American boys be champing at the bit to visit Paris? To visit the Louvre? No way. The only thing on the minds of these three smirking teen-age airheads who find more trouble than they could ever have anticipated in ''An American Werewolf in Paris'' is accumulating ''sex points'' on their competing mental scorecards. 
No sooner have they sneaked into the Eiffel Tower after visiting hours than Andy (Tom Everett Scott), the least obnoxious of the three, falls literally head over heels with a weepy French girl who makes a suicide leap from the observatory. Andy, who has come equipped with rope for performing his own daredevil stunts, dives after her and saves her life. 
It turns out, of course, that the woman he rescues, Serafine (Julie Delpy), has ample reason to want to die. She was recently turned into a werewolf by her sinister skinhead boyfriend, who hangs out with his buddies in a Parisian nightclub that Andy and his pals visit. Far from loathing their lupine, blood-guzzling alter-egos, the werewolves who run the place are sick and tired of having to wait for the moon to rise before feasting on human (preferably American) bodies. They have discovered a serum that can transform them into monsters at any time of day or night. And the climax of their nightly parties is a carnivorous, drug-choreographed rampage. 
''An American Werewolf in Paris,'' directed by Anthony Waller, is only distantly related to the 1981 John Landis film ''An American Werewolf in London,'' which mixed horror and comedy with considerably more panache. A slapdash, poorly acted, paint-by-numbers teen horror comedy, the sequel is too frenetically edited to build any suspense, and its special effects are strictly  bargain basement. 
The movie does have one nastily amusing sequence in which Andy, while undergoing the metamorphosis from man into monster, picks up a lustful, squealing girl named Amy (Julie Bowen) who becomes increasingly aroused the more the beast in him comes out. But only up to a point. Naturally Amy is punished for her libido and quickly dispatched into the realm of the undead. But even after becoming a zombie, she hasn't lost her style. Lamenting the loss of her teen-age beauty, she whines petulantly about the hundreds of hours she wasted honing her shape on the StairMaster. 
''An American Werewolf in Paris'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of gory violence, some  profanity and glimpses of nudity.

‽
‽The Postman‽,‽Every truly awful movie epic has a point of no return, a moment when the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is an awed amusement. If you have a low tolerance for mawkish jingoism, Kevin Costner's post-apocalyptic Western, ''The Postman,'' offers a new opportunity for levity every few minutes after its first hour. 
There is the moment when a girl, too young to have lived before a series of catastrophes destroyed the United States as we know it, begins singing ''America the Beautiful'' in a quavery little voice. There's the moment when a grizzled 68-year-old survivor, asked about the tattoo on his arm, becomes misty-eyed as he recalls ''a little girl with eyes as wide as saucers in a little town called Saigon.'' Or how about Mr. Costner's solemn christening of a pioneer community ''Elvis, Ore.''? 
In a fable that makes the delivery of mail a metaphor for the rebuilding of civilization, there are also impassioned group recitations of the letter carrier's oath delivered by teen-agers with the fervor of the Pledge of Allegiance in an American Legion hall. 
It didn't have to be this way. ''The Postman,'' adapted from a novel by David Brin, is set in the year 2013, when all that remains of the United States are scattered primitive settlements in the Northwest. This worst-possible scenario of the near future is plausible enough to cause shivers the more you consider it. Mr. Costner, who produced, directed and stars in the movie, has tried to turn it into a classic 1950's-style western in which he is the revivified embodiment of that hoary movie archetype, the Man With No Name. The outlaws are an army of warriors, the Holnists, led by the brutal General Bethlehem (Will Patton), who punishes his soldiers for minor infractions of discipline by stringing them up by the heels and slashing their throats. His army terrorizes this feudal pioneer society, extorting tribute and forcibly recruiting soldiers. Eventually the nameless hero and the evil general face each other down in a ''High Noon''-like confrontation. (Mr. Costner's physical resemblance to Gary Cooper is positively eerie in some scenes.) 
Mr. Costner's character, a shipping clerk in his former life, assumes his heroic identity when he discovers a pack of undelivered mail and a postal uniform in a rusted mail truck with a skeleton at the wheel. Donning the outfit, he delivers the mail to a nearby settlement and stirs up hope by improvising a credible yarn about being a representative of the newly restored government now based in Minneapolis. Accepted as genuine, the Postman quickly becomes a symbol of hope, and the guiding force behind a teen-age army of letter carriers who recognize the American flag and begin linking communities with a 21st-century Pony Express. 
''The Postman'' knows no restraint. Every scene is played to the hilt for its mythic, tear-jerking potential, and after a while (the movie runs nearly three hours) the accumulated sentiment begins to curdle. The dialogue, a numbing succession of western-movie cliches, is spoken with a cartoon-balloon emphasis that makes it seem all the more phony. The Postman's most dedicated disciple, a boy who has named himself Ford Lincoln Mercury (Larenz Tate), is such an obnoxiously eager little beaver that you keep hoping he'll be disposed of before the movie's over. (No such luck.) 
Mr. Costner, star that he is, comfortably holds the screen, exuding an indefatigable decency even as this shamelessly corny, ham-fisted movie suggests rampant narcissism below his friendly surface. As a bald-faced exercise in cinematic self-deification, ''The Postman'' makes Barbra Streisand's ''Mirror Has Two Faces'' seem almost modest. 
''The Postman'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has glimpses of nudity and scenes of violence.

Running time: 170 minutes. This film is rated R.

‽
‽Mr. Magoo‽,‽''Mr. Magoo'' is three movies for the price of one, and it's still no bargain. 
This schizoid stab at comedy is bracketed at beginning and end by animation that resurrects the severely myopic, supremely self-confident blundering gasbag of the popular UPA cartoons of the 1960's. But shortly after it begins, ''Mr. Magoo'' trots out Leslie Nielsen as the live version of the old fool. Then, apparently because the charm of a one-joke character created for short films is unsustainable over feature length, ''Mr. Magoo'' decides to have a go at comic adventure. 
Poor old Mr. Magoo should have been allowed to rest in piece. This film suggests that when you loot a crypt, you're likely to find a corpse. 
Neither the writers, Pat Proft and Tom Sherohman, nor Stanley Tong, the director, who came out of Hong Kong to direct Jackie Chan vehicles like ''Rumble in the Bronx'' and ''Supercop,'' manage to breathe life into the Magoo of the 1990's. 
Yes, he still can't see well enough to drive safely. He mistakes the decorations on a woman's hat for canapes at a black tie party. He locks himself inside a sarcophagus, thinking it is a phone booth. He spends a good deal of time tossing a priceless ruby into his topiary in the belief that the gem is a plaything for his bulldog, Angus, who is the film's liveliest, most interesting character. 
The ruby, known as the Star of Kuristan, is the fuel that drives the movie. Stolen just after Magoo, as an eggplant-canning factory magnate and patron of the arts, has dedicated a new museum wing housing the jewel, it is accidentally dropped into his fishing tackle box. The thief is Luanne (Kelly Lynch), a deceitful cat burglar watched over by Bob Morgan (Nick Chinlund), a clumsy henchman employed by Austin Cloquet (Malcolm McDowell), who has hired Luanne and is planning to sell the ruby at a convention of the world's great criminals. 
Before ''Mr. Magoo'' comes to an end, two feuding F.B.I. and C.I.A. operatives (Stephen Tobolowsky and Ernie Hudson) have decided that Magoo is the thief; Luanne pretends to fall for Magoo in an effort to find the ruby; Magoo's helpful nephew, Waldo (Matt Keeslar), is smitten with Kuristan's lovely representative (Jennifer Garner), and Magoo not only masquerades as a deadly criminal named Peru but also travels to Brazil to find Peru. (It's a geography joke.) 
Mr. Tong, whose specialty is action, makes the last portion of the film, involving the criminals' convention, the intervention of the authorities and the showdown with Peru in Brazil, move at a lively pace when it is not slowing down to search for comedy in an encounter between Magoo and a mandrill he mistakes for a child. 
Incomplete as a cartoon, indecisive as comedy, halting as adventure, ''Mr. Magoo'' turns out to be a shortsighted project. 
''Mr. Magoo'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It contains some menace and mayhem.

‽
‽Jackie Brown‽,‽Having rested extensively on his laurels, Quentin Tarantino returns to feature-film directing after ''Pulp Fiction'' with what might as well be two new crime tales, both called ''Jackie Brown.'' The better of these, halfway visible, is a quick and lean adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ''Rum Punch'' replete with pop asides, shrewd maneuvering and all the casually hip hallmarks of the Tarantino style. But you'll have to look hard to find it within the slower, talkier, more sluggish ''Jackie Brown'' that actually appears on screen. 
Running nearly as long as ''Pulp Fiction'' even though its ambitions are more familiar and small, ''Jackie Brown'' has the makings of another, chattier ''Get Shorty'' with an added homage to Pam Grier, the Annie Oakley of 1970's blaxploitation. That could well have been enough, since Mr. Tarantino shows such obvious affection for his leading lady and for the cheerful, greedy lowlife in Mr. Leonard's stories. 
But for all its enthusiasm, this film isn't sharp enough to afford all the time it wastes on small talk, long drives, trips to the mall and favorite songs played on car radios. And although Ms. Grier makes an enjoyable comeback, she isn't an actress well served by quiet stretches of doing nothing before the camera. 
Ms. Grier plays the title role of a  flight attendant caught in a trap between Federal authorities (with Michael Keaton as an overconfident  Government agent) and a colossally wily gun dealer named Ordell Robbie. Among the best news about the film is that Samuel L. Jackson's role is even splashier than the one he had in ''Pulp Fiction'' and that his performance is even more of a treat.  The film more than justifies its long, happy stretches of simply watching Ordell work his scams on the unsuspecting, whose number most certainly does not include Max Cherry. 
Max (played by Robert Forster, a wonderfully strong presence here) is a bail bondsman who will eventually develop a soft spot for Jackie, which manifests itself as a taste for old Delfonics songs. But on the job, completely unruffled, Max gives the appearance of having seen everything, even an operator as cold-blooded as Ordell. 
Ordell, whose look is priceless (slick ponytail, tiny needle-shaped goatee) even if his frequent racial references overwork the homeboy pretensions of Mr. Tarantino's screenplay, begins the story with a clear confidence in his ability to outsmart everyone, Jackie included.  Then Ordell begins realizing he may be overmatched. 
Though the film waits an hour and a half to put Ms. Grier into a red dress and let her start strutting, she finally delivers the same kind of payoff for which she was once so famous, delivering the no-nonsense comeuppance to anyone who dares to annoy her. In one early scene, Mr. Tarantino has great directorial fun showing the audience how Jackie got hold of a gun and just how coolly she can brandish it. 
The audience can thus root for Jackie to play off the film's other characters against one another, and can speculate on the whereabouts of a bag full of money that is pivotal to the plot. But beyond that there isn't anything special at stake in ''Jackie Brown,'' and Mr. Tarantino allows the plotting to grow so knotty that it loses interest. The film is best (and most patiently) enjoyed as a set of laid-back sketches that don't always head anywhere, even if a filmmaker of Mr. Tarantino's talents can make schmoozing such an end in itself. 
Bridget Fonda, as the laziest and most sullen of Ordell's girlfriends, spends much of the film lounging woozily on a sofa, even though Ordell says this will rob her of ambition.  ''Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV,'' she replies. 
Also contributing notably to the film's ensemble loafing is Robert De Niro as a stumblebum ex-con who serves as Ordell's henchman, even if he sometimes seems baffled by the boss's business methods. 
''Who's that?'' Mr. De Niro's Louis Gara asks about a corpse in a car trunk. 
''That's Beaumont,'' Ordell replies. 
''Who's Beaumont?'' Louis wonders. 
''A employee I had to let go,'' Ordell explains. 
There's hardly a scene in ''Jackie Brown'' that doesn't, somewhere within the banal chatter, hide a tough little grace note like that. 
''Jackie Brown'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief sexual situations, wall-to-wall stylized profanity and frequent streetwise use of the word ''nigger'' describing both black and white characters.

‽
‽The Winter Guest‽,‽Phyllida Law and Emma Thompson bear such a remarkable physical resemblance that if you didn't know these wonderful British actresses are actually mother and daughter, you could almost imagine that the same person wearing different makeup and aided by trick photography was playing both their roles in ''The Winter Guest.'' In this solemnly talky film, adapted by Sharman Macdonald (with the director Alan Rickman) from his play, Ms. law and Ms. Thompson are Elspeth and Frances, a mother and her recently widowed daughter who spend a frigid winter day trudging through the bleakly beautiful landscape around a Scottish seaside town. 
It is so cold that even the sea around the village has frozen solid. And the film, with cinematography by Seamus McGarvey, luxuriously drinks in a magnificent desolation that conjures up somber thoughts of mortality and human loss. Frances, a professional photographer, is still grieving over the death from an unidentified illness of her dashing husband, whose pictures crowd the mantelpiece of the roomy cottage she shares with her teen-age son, Alex (Gary Hollywood). When Elspeth arrives uninvited to offer emotional support, Frances is not happy to see her. And half the dialogue during their hike consists of petty bickering over matters like Frances's short, allegedly unalluring haircut. 
A fussy, sentimental exercise in theatrical counterpoint, ''The Winter Guest'' interweaves Elspeth's and Frances's dialogues with simultaneous little dramas in the lives of three other pairs of villagers. Lily (Sheila Reid) and Chloe (Sandra Voe), two elderly women, take a bus to a nearby town to attend a funeral. While Frances is out of the house, her bashful son brings home Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a brash tomboyish new girl in town for his first serious kiss. Meanwhile, Sam (Douglas Murphy) and Tom (Sean Biggerstaff), two pubescent schoolboys, hang out together exchanging bogus sexual lore that prompts Tom to conduct an excruciating experiment involving some fiery ointment. He also saves an abandoned kitten. 
It is easy to see why Mr. Rickman, a talented English actor who personifies a rakish literary worldliness, was drawn to ''The Winter Guest'' as his first directorial feature. With its four pairs of seaside partners seen at various stages of life, the play offers tour-de-force acting opportunities. And the film's verbal pas de deux are so polished and fine-tuned that they go a long way toward camouflaging the creaky portentousness of much of the dialogue. Elspeth, who has a voracious appetite for life despite signs of failing health, looks at her well-creased face in the mirror and remarks that she can't reconcile that face with the fact that inside she is still 17. It's one of the movie's many heavily underlined reflections on youth and age. 
The dramatic tension between Elspeth and Frances hinges on a question that hangs teasingly (and falsely) in the air and is not answered until the film's end: Is Frances planning to leave her grief (and her mother) behind and move to Australia? In an equally false moment, Alex's imminent loss of virginity is suddenly pre-empted by his glancing up at a picture of his father, who seems to be staring at him. The boy explains sheepishly that he thinks his father has been haunting the house. 
As the movie goes along, its stiff upper lip quickly begins to tremble and then to flutter. By the end, it has degenerated into an unabashedly mushy assertion of ties of need that bind us together. Somehow those ties make everybody in the movie bizarrely oblivious of the climate. If it is the coldest day of the year, why is no one wearing gloves, a hat or ear covering? And why does no one's breath come out white in the freezing air? Could it be those hot salty tears that the characters are just barely able to suppress have created a freakish momentary thaw? 
''The Winter Guest'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains sexual situations and some profanity.

‽
‽Titanic‽,‽The long-awaited advent of the most expensive movie ever made, the reportedly $200 million ''Titanic,'' brings history to mind, and not just the legendary seafaring disaster of April 15, 1912. Think back also, exactly 58 years ago today, to the Dec. 19 New York premiere of another grand, transporting love story set against a backdrop of prideful excess, cataclysmic upheaval and character-defining trial by fire. 
Recall how that cultural landmark wowed audiences with its bravado, mad extravagance and state-of-the-art Hollywood showmanship, all fueled by one unstoppable filmmaker and his obsessive imagination.  Just as David O. Selznick had Atlanta to burn, now James Cameron has a ship to sink, but he also has much more than calamity to explore in this gloriously retrograde new epic. Mr. Cameron's magnificent ''Titanic'' is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to ''Gone With the Wind.'' 
What a rarity that makes it in today's world of meaningless gimmicks and short attention spans: a huge, thrilling three-and-a-quarter-hour experience that unerringly lures viewers into the beauty and heartbreak of its lost world. Astonishing technological advances are at work here, but only in the service of one spectacular illusion: that the ship is afloat again, and that the audience is intimately involved in its voyage. 
What's more, Mr. Cameron succeeds magically in linking his film's young lovers, played enchantingly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, with established details of the ''Titanic'' story. And let's not forget the offscreen drama: delayed release and outrageous costs made ''Titanic'' the joke of the summer. Now it's the movie of the year. 
Though the tender moments in Mr. Cameron's earlier films have mostly involved Arnold Schwarzenegger, graceful storytelling from this one-man army of a filmmaker (a director, a producer, a writer and an  editor) is the biggest of many surprises here. Swept away by the romance of his subject matter, Mr. Cameron rises to the occasion with a simple, captivating narrative style, one that cares little for subtlety but overflows with wonderful, well-chosen Hollywood hokum. In its own sobering way, the film is forward-looking, too, as its early brashness gives way to near-religious humility when the moments of reckoning arrive. Ultimately a haunting tale of human nature, with endless displays of callousness, gallantry or cowardice, it offers an unforgettable vision of millennium-ready unease in the sight of passengers adrift in icy seas on that last, moonless night. 
That Mr. Cameron allowed flashlights into what should have been a pitch-black sequence is one of the rare times when ''Titanic'' willingly departs from established fact. Otherwise, with an attention to detail that goes well beyond fanatical, the film flawlessly recreates its monument to Gilded Age excess. Behind-the-scenes details here, which prove no less fascinating than Selznick's ''Gone With the Wind'' memos, include Mr. Cameron's having persuaded the original carpet manufacturer to make an 18,000-square-foot reproduction of its ''Titanic'' weave and his having insisted that every sign, uniform and logo for the Southampton sailing sequence also be created in mirror image, so that the camera could reverse the apparent direction of the nearly life-size model ship. 
Sets match old photographs right down to the sculpture and woodwork; costumes incorporate fragments of vintage clothing; even the silver White Star Line ashtrays had to be right. A core group of 150 extras worked with an Edwardian etiquette coach throughout the filming, furthering the illusion that the privileged past had returned to life. 
''Titanic'' is no museum piece, however. It's a film with tremendous momentum right from its deceptive, crass-looking start. The story opens in the present day, with a team of scientist-cowboys (led by Bill Paxton) hunting for lost treasure amid the Titanic wreckage. Though Mr. Cameron made his own journey to the ocean floor to film amazing glimpses of the ship, he treats these explorers as glib 90's hotshots, the kind of macho daredevils who could just as easily be found tracking twisters or dinosaurs in a summer action film. 
''Oops, somebody left the water running,'' one of them wisecracks about the sunken ship. 
Then the film begins, ever so teasingly, to open its window to the past.  A 101-year-old woman (played spiritedly by Gloria Stuart, an 87-year-old beauty who appeared in ''Gold Diggers of 1935'') hears of the expedition and says it has links to her own history. It seems that she, Rose, was the model for a nude sketch found by the present-day fortune hunters in a Titanic safe. It is the only thing of value to be retrieved there. The money in the safe has turned to mud. 
But where is the Heart of the Ocean, the egg-size blue diamond Rose wears in the drawing? Rose begins telling her story, and at long last 1912 is at hand. In an introductory sequence mounted on a colossal scale, Mr. Cameron shows the ship being boarded by its full economic range of passengers, from the haughty rich to the third-class passengers being checked for head lice. 
Young Rose (Ms. Winslet) arrives at the dock in the show-stopping plumage of Deborah L. Scott's costume designs, and in the unfortunate company of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), the tiresome snob whom she has agreed to marry, largely at the urging of her impecunious mother (Frances Fisher). The Rose-Cal story line, which is the weakest part of the film thanks to Cal's unwavering odiousness, plays like Edith  Wharton Lite. 
Meanwhile, in a nearby tavern, adorable Jack Dawson (Mr. DiCaprio) is winning a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game. It won't be long before Jack is bounding happily into steerage, showing off the boyish adventurousness that makes him such a cure for what's ailing Rose.  Aboard the ship of dreams, as the Titanic is often called here, Jack is one serious dreamboat. 
A bohemian artist (whose drawings were done by Mr. Cameron) who has spent the requisite time in Paris, he offers all the fun and flirtatiousness that Rose has been missing. This 20-year-old has also shown his share of worldly wisdom by the end of the story. It goes without saying that it's Jack, not Cal, who is the film's true gentleman. And that Mr. DiCaprio has made an inspired career move in so successfully meeting the biggest challenge for an actor of his generation: a traditional role. 
Among the many miracles of ''Titanic'' is its way of creating a sweet, life-changing courtship between Jack and Rose in the course of only a few days. At the risk of turning into a women's picture, ''Titanic'' brings these two together through a dramatic meeting, an invitation for Jack at a formal first-class dinner, a dancing romp among steerage passengers and even enough intimate moments to give the love story heat.  Splendid chemistry between the stars, along with much color from the supporting cast and careful foreshadowing from Mr. Cameron, keeps the romance buoyant even after the dread iceberg gets in its way. 
Comfortable even in suggesting that the ship's lookouts missed the danger because they were busy watching lovestruck Jack and Rose, Mr. Cameron lets tragedy strike midway through the film. That way, the disaster can unfold in almost real time, with terrifying precision on a par with all the other details here. 
Not for ''Titanic'' the shrill hysteria of ordinary disaster stories; this film is especially delicate in its slow way of letting the gravity of the situation become clear. Much scarier than any explosion-filled caper film is the simple assessment from the ship's master builder, played with great dignity by Victor Garber:  ''In an hour or so, all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.'' 
As Mr. Cameron joked during production, about a film that pitilessly observes the different plights of the rich and the poor, ''We're holding just short of Marxist dogma.'' (A lavish ''Titanic'' coffee table book from HarperCollins is filled with fascinating data about the film, from the director's casual asides to accounts of the technological wizardry, like computerized hydraulics, that were devised for repeatedly sinking the ship.) By this point, the audience knows the ship so fully, from Cal and Rose's elaborate suite to the depths of the boiler room, that the film is on shockingly familiar territory as Rose searches every newly waterlogged area for Jack. 
Very much to Mr. Cameron's credit is the lack of logistical confusion.  Indeed, the film's modern-day characters even watch a computerized version of how the ship split and then rose vertically just before it plunged straight down, events that are later re-enacted with awesome power. Despite all this advance information and the revelation that Rose lives to be 101, ''Titanic'' still sustains an extraordinary degree of suspense. 
Tiny, devastating touches -- how the same doll whose face rests on the ocean floor in 1996 is clutched in the arms of a pretty little girl who idolizes Jack, or a four-hanky coda seen in Rose's dream -- work as well as the film's big spectacle in giving the tragedy of ''Titanic'' its full dramatic impact. Though many of the story's minor characters are one-note (hardly the case with Kathy Bates's hearty Molly Brown or Bernard Hill's brave captain), the cumulative effect of their presence is anything but shallow. 
Beyond its romance, ''Titanic'' offers an indelibly wrenching story of blind arrogance and its terrible consequences. It's the rare Hollywood adventure film that brings mythic images of tragedy -- the fall of Icarus, the ruin of Ozymandias -- so easily to mind. 
The irony is that Mr. Cameron's ''Titanic'' is such a Titanic in its own right, a presumptuous reach for greatness against all reasonable odds. The film itself gambles everything on visual splendor and technological accomplishment, which is one reason its extravagance is fully justified on screen. But if Mr. Cameron's own brazenness echoes that seen in his story, remember the essential difference. This ''Titanic'' is too good to sink. 
''Titanic'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes partial nudity, one brief sexual situation, mild profanity and the soul-shaking sight of a great ship going down.

‽Tomorrow Never Dies‽,‽No need to feel badly if the right watch, drink, cell phone, etc., don't turn you into James Bond. They don't really do it for Pierce Brosnan in ''Tomorrow Never Dies,'' either. Despite Mr. Brosnan's best efforts to be lethally debonair, the Bond franchise has sacrificed most of what made this character unique in the first place, turning the world's suavest spy into one more pitchman and fashion plate. This latest film is such a generic action event that it could be any old summer blockbuster, except  that its hero is chronically overdressed. 
This is not to say that ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' won't be an international success like ''Goldeneye,'' which wasn't much better. But it should fare best in corners of the world where nobody knows how little the title means, or how accurately it reflects the rest of the film's shallowness. Closer than ever to cartoon superhero status, Bond is seen battling ridiculous odds, dodging computer-generated explosions, delivering lame bon mots and boasting pitifully about his sexual prowess. All that gives this an up-to-date sensibility is the audience's awareness that  M (Judi Dench) and Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) could sue him for sexual harassment on the basis of his small talk. 
This film does have a lively villain in Jonathan Pryce, as a media mogul who dreams of everything from manufacturing his own war to marketing software with bugs (so that customers will have to upgrade for years). Mr. Pryce reigns mischievously over an empire that Bond must infiltrate, and he also has a wife (Teri Hatcher) who is one of Bond's approximately one million ex-flames. Ms. Hatcher, like Mr. Brosnan, speaks in a perfect monotone, and so does Michelle Yeoh, the Hong Kong action star who is meant to kick some life into the series. 
The film's other attempts to show Bond in a romantic light are so hopeless that it's a lucky thing his partnership with Ms. Yeoh's character, the svelte and athletic Wai Lin, stays confined to toylike weaponry and flat double-entendres. 
''And now a word from our sponsor,'' muttered the critic beside me,  as the camera offered a good look at James Bond's vodka bottle midway through the so-called story. (The humor-free screenplay is by Bruce Feirstein, author of ''Real Men Don't Eat Quiche'' as well as ''Goldeneye.''  The workmanlike director is Roger Spottiswoode.) Indeed, despite  Bond's mission to defeat the evil mogul, product plugs are the film's most serious business, especially since the audience may be bored enough to start looking at labels. 
The film's two best supporting turns come from Vincent Schiavelli, who has a cheerfully outrageous scene as a torture expert, and from a nice, smart BMW that works on remote control. Hiding in the back seat, Bond pilots the car through a tire-screeching chase. Don't try this at home. 
''Tomorrow Never Dies'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence a la videogames, smirky innuendoes and a couple of brief sexual situations.

‽Will It Snow for Christmas?‽,‽Isn't it amazing how children with few material advantages instinctively devise clever ways to amuse themselves? When they're not slaving under the thumb of their autocratic father on his vegetable farm in the south of France, seven illegitimate children find time to race homemade toy sailboats along the farm's irrigation ditches. Or, using teaspoons and a marble, they play a fast and furious variation of table tennis without a net. 
The accumulation of such intimate familial detail in ''Will It Snow for Christmas?'' gives Sandrine Veysset's moving French film, which won the Cesar (the French Oscar) for best debut film of 1996, a remarkable textural richness. 
The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, transports you to a hardscrabble world of outdoor work and simple pleasures (the farmhouse lacks plumbing and central heating), where the bedtime stories a mother tells her children acquire a mythic resonance. 
As the family and hired hands are shown frantically harvesting everything from parsley to lettuce to leeks, you get a powerful feel for the rhythms and the pressures of farm life, the passing of the seasons and the tyranny and beauty of the ever-changing climate. 
For all the movie's celebration of childhood wonder, ''Will It Snow for Christmas?'' is anything but sentimental. A level-headed, almost neo-realist film, it conveys a grim undercurrent of despair as it observes the children's emotionally abused, overworked mother (Dominique Reymond) doing the work of three and trying to be a loving parent to her brood. As she exhaustedly dispenses goodnight kisses to her children, each of whom has an animal nickname, you feel the depth and tenacity of her love but also the effort of will it takes to express it under such conditions. 
It is for survival as much as anything that the mother stays with the father (Daniel Duval), who lives most of the time with his wife and ''legitimate'' family in a nearby town. For better or worse, there is a certain security in indentured servitude. 
And as the movie makes clear in a bedroom scene between the couple, beneath the father's tyranny and abuse lurks a grudging tenderness toward the woman who gave him seven offspring. 
The father may be a manipulative bully, but he is not quite a monster.  He demeans the mother as a whore and regularly reminds the children that they are illegitimate, but his iron rule also holds their lives together in its practical way. Even when the father, an inveterate womanizer, makes a pass at his oldest daughter, the movie treats the incident with minimal hysteria. It's just one more selfish, impulsive power play to add  to his list of abuses. 
''Will It Snow for Christmas?,'' which was filmed over several months, begins in the summer and ends on Christmas Eve with the mother telling her children a personal story that has acquired the resonance of a fairy tale. Recounting a dream she had when she was 16, the mother tells of meeting God, who orders her to run a race with a fat woman who seems easily beatable. When the fat woman unexpectedly speeds to victory, the mother is told her punishment: she will have seven children. 
Far from feeling unwanted, the children accept the story as a miraculous fable that makes them special. The story underlines the profound ambiguity at the heart of this beautiful film. The mother, beautifully played by Ms. Reymond in various shades of torment, resignation and embattled passion, has created something close to heaven (a bucolic familial idyll) while living in a kind of hell. The two kingdoms are inseparable. 
WILL IT SNOW FOR CHRISTMAS? 
Written (in French, with English subtitles) and directed by Sandrine Veysset; director of photography, Helene Louvart; edited by Nelly Quettier; production designer, Jacque Dubus; produced by Humbert Balsan; released by Zeitgeist Films. At the Film Forum, 209 Houston Street, South Village. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not rated. 
WITH: Dominique Reymond (Mother), Daniel Duval (Father) and Jessica Martinez, Alexandre Roger, Xavier Colonna, Fanny Rochetin, Flavie Chimenes, Jeremy Chaix and Guillaume Mathonnet (Children).

‽Scream 2‽,‽It looks as if the ''Scream'' franchise has staying power. In fact, the sneaky ''Scream 2'' has so much tongue-in-cheek trickery that it virtually escapes the horror genre, the one it so happily lampoons. This ''Scream,'' once again directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, almost works as straight satire. It's so sharp -- pardon the expression -- that no pretty young things absolutely had to die. 
Well, O.K., maybe just one. The opening slaughter of a high-profile actress has become a standard feature, and this time Jada Pinkett does the honors. The film announces its fun house quality by sending her to the movies with a date (Omar Epps) to see ''Stab,'' a fictionalized version of ''Scream,'' which was fiction to begin with. But who's on first, anyhow? The audience for Mr. Craven's sequel is invited to enter a hall of mirrors and stay there, even watching characters in a sequel argue about whether sequels are any good.  Not for nothing does one of the later fatal stalkings take place at film school. 
At the ''Stab'' screening, where fans run amok in the Munch-inspired ''Scream'' costume and a party atmosphere prevails, Ms. Pinkett establishes this film's modus operandi for short-circuiting criticism. Ms. Pinkett, a black actress with a standout role in ''Scream 2,'' is heard complaining about the lily whiteness of the usual horror film cast. And the giddiness of ''Stab'' fans suggests that horror needn't be taken too seriously. Later on there are equally offhanded references to ''all the violence-in-cinema issues,'' even though those issues remain alive and well here. Joking about something doesn't make it go away. 
Still, while ''Scream 2'' manages to leave most of its cast unavailable for ''Scream 3,'' it keeps the gruesomeness on a back burner. (Speaking of which, ''Stab'' even immortalizes the first film's smoking Jiffy  Pop, the one left on the kitchen stove by Drew Barrymore.) There is less emphasis on senseless murder than on the profits it can bring, at least in the media circus that now envelops the surviving ''Scream'' characters.  Courteney Cox's Gale Weathers, the television reporter who has grown even more hard-boiled than she used to be, is now a best-selling author. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), wrongly jailed in the first film, now wants 10 minutes' worth of national television time as reparations. And Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the series' intrepid heroine, has lived to see herself played by Tori Spelling onscreen. 
Despite a different venue, so that the new film follows Sidney to leafy Windsor College in the Midwest, not all that much has changed. Somebody is still making whispery phone calls to people that he, she or they plan to kill. (''What's your favorite scary movie?'' somebody asks here, echoing the killer's question. This time the answer is ''Showgirls.'')  The victims are still cute and not too smart about staying home alone.  And college gives the killer a chance to raid sorority houses, which the filmmakers have fun decimating in their own way. ''No, I really mean it,'' says one sorority sister. ''Hi!'' 
The cast still includes Jamie Kennedy as Randy, its resident geek, and David Arquette as Dewey Riley, its traveling one. (Dewey, the film's goofiest character, comes from California to help Sidney fend off a ''Stab''-inspired copycat killer.) New this time are Elise Neal as Sidney's roommate, Duane Martin as Gale's scaredy-cat cameraman, Laurie Metcalf as a dowdy local reporter and assorted campus types. These range from the film professor who ends class by saying ''That'll be a wrap'' to the guy (Jerry O'Connell) who manages to imitate Tom Cruise and David Cassidy simultaneously, thanks to a ''Top Gun'' homage. Even if you haven't spent as much obsessive time at the video store as these guys have, you might enjoy helping ''Scream 2'' laugh all the way to the bank. 
''Scream 2'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes moderately messy stabbings, skewerings, etc., as well as occasional profanity. There are no sexual situations and notably less leering this time around.

‽Hugo Pool‽,‽With ''Hugo Pool,'' a whimsical stylistic throwback to those psychedelic days of yesteryear, Robert Downey, whose free-for-all spoofs ''Putney Swope'' and ''Greaser's Palace'' gained a certain cachet in hippie circles, has returned to filmmaking. And although this flighty comic allegory about love and death in contemporary Los Angeles is wildly overacted, with loose ends flying everywhere, it still conveys an antic poignancy. 
The central character, Floyd Gaylen (Patrick Dempsey), is a beautiful young man of saintly disposition, suffering from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), who accompanies the movie's title character (Alyssa Milano), an intrepid swimming pool cleaner, on her daily rounds through some of the posher neighborhoods of Los Angeles during a drought. By the end of the day they've fallen in love. And the film, which bites its lip until the final scenes, figuratively bursts into tears. 
Around this story, written by Mr. Downey with his wife, Laura, who died of ALS three years ago at 36, the filmmaker has constructed a zany seat-of-your-pants spoof of Hollywood narcissists and familial dysfunction. Hugo's brassy mother, Minerva (Cathy Moriarty), is a compulsive gambler whose sole pleasure is playing the horses. And when Floyd, who can only speak through a computer, drops the name of a horse that is running that day, Minerva becomes obsessed with the certainty that it's a winner. 
Hugo's loony white-haired father, Henry (Malcolm McDowell), an alcoholic who babbles on about his addiction to ''ring dang do,'' is dispatched by Hugo in her water truck to the Colorado River to bring back an illicit load to fill up the empty pool of a gangster named Chic Chicalini (Richard Lewis), who is throwing a party that evening. Joining Henry on the journey is an extremely laconic leprechaun (Sean Penn), whose bright blue shoes Henry covets. 
Hugo's eccentric customers include a bored Los Angeles matron who pays a handsome lifeguard to save her and deliver mouth-to-mouth resusciation when she ''accidentally'' falls into her pool, and a egomaniacal Dutch movie director named Franz (Robert Downey Jr.) who in a fit of temperament has shot and killed one of his extras. 
The film's central love story and its comic embellishments feel forced together, because the movie's performances are so jarringly out of tune. Mr. McDowell, Mr. Lewis and Robert Downey Jr. are gratingly garish caricatures, and Mr. Penn seems almost to be sleepwalking through his thankless, and inexplicable, role. 
But Ms. Milano and Mr. Dempsey  are clear and understated and give the film its heart. And when the movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinemas, concentrates on the details of caring for an ALS patient who is barely able to move or speak, it suddenly snaps to attention. All the peripheral nonsense fades away, and you feel for the brave soul who, despite his inability to talk and be sensate in the most basic ways, maintains an open heart.

‽
‽Home Alone 3‽,‽It was a shrewd studio executive who decided that the ''Home Alone'' series didn't require the towheaded, hooded-eyed screen presence of Macaulay Culkin to stay alive and kicking. As ''Home Alone 3'' vigorously demonstrates, all the franchise really needs to keep going is a charismatic child (Alex D. Linz has replaced Mr. Culkin) with no great acting skills but loads of pseudo-innocent chubby-cheeked adorability. 
Put sophisticated remote-control gadgetry at the boy's fingertips, and get a director (the newcomer Raja Gosnell) with a feel for the kind of knockabout farce that makes grown-ups look like fools, and you have a refreshed formula that's good for at least one more episode and maybe two. Providing crucial continuity is John Hughes, who masterminded the first two ''Home Alones'' and is co-producer and writer for Part 3. 
''Home Alone 3'' is essentially a good-natured repeat of the blockbuster original, but with a different all-American family (the Pruitts have replaced the McCallisters) in  an upscale Chicago suburb. Its hero, 8-year-old Alex Pruitt (Mr. Linz), the youngest of the three Pruitt children, is a mechanical whiz of infinite resourcefulness and indefatigable self-confidence. 
While his family is out of the house, Alex fortifies the place with so many potentially lethal booby traps that an intruder unlucky enough to force his way in will find himself plunged into a zany chamber of horrors. Even the family pets, a white mouse named Doris (whom Alex enjoys scaring by showing her a neighbor's cat through his telescope) and a loudmouthed parrot that can light matches, get into the act. 
The invaders -- who inspire Alex to do things like place what only appears to be a trampoline over a camouflaged, snow-filled swimming pool into which the villains eventually fling themselves from an attic window -- are four bumbling international gangsters who have got their hands on an Air Force computer chip that makes missiles undetectable and are planning to sell it to North Korean terrorists. Through a baggage mix-up at the San Francisco airport, the chip, which has been hidden in a toy car known as the Mutator, ends up winging its way to Chicago and into Alex's bedroom. 
Descending upon the community, wearing silly disguises and armed with enough surveillance and safe-cracking equipment to gratify the most technologically fetishistic fan of ''Mission: Impossible,'' the bad guys are unable to determine exactly where the toy landed and resort to systematically burglarizing the homes in Alex's neighborhood to find it. Scanning the area with his telescope while his parents are out, the boy, who is home with the chicken pox, twice observes a burglary in progress and reports it to the police. 
Both times, the criminals escape before the police arrive, and Alex is lectured sternly about turning in false alarms. Adult disbelief makes the child all the more determined to catch the culprits and clear his good name. 
In the movie's cleverest sequence, he equips the Mutator with a video camera and sends it bouncing across the street into a neighbor's house to photograph the criminals. In the funny extended chase sequence that ensues, the adroitly deployed vehicle tricks the gangsters into doing one uproarious pratfall after another, as they try to retrieve the apparently indestructible toy, which has the miraculous ability to leap over high fences. As in the original ''Home Alone,'' the combat turns more brutal once the criminals enter the Pruitt home and find themselves besieged by an astounding array of mechanical contraptions, several of them built like fancy slingshots. 
The difference between ''Home Alone 3'' and its predecessors is largely a matter of tone. Where Mr. Culkin seemed to take a sadistic, poker-faced glee in the injuries he inflicted, Mr. Linz expresses the more innocent delight of a child caught up in an action-packed Saturday morning cartoon. 
Behind the villains' comic grimaces, there's no real pain. Care has been taken to make the mechanics behind each prank appear as elaborately silly as a Rube Goldberg contraption. And in making the villains (Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny Von Dohlen, and David Thornton) buffoonish caricatures of television spies, the movie deftly spoofs a technological mystique that Alex's ingenious homemade defenses puncture again and again. 
In doing so, the movie exploits the generation gap in technological know-how between today's computer-wise whiz kids and their parents. In making Alex such a mechanical marvel, the movie strokes children's fantasies of remote-control omnipotence while reassuring working parents that their children, equipped with the latest in telecommunications gadgetry, will be resourceful enough to amuse themselves and, if necessary, ward off danger when they are not around. 
''Home Alone 3'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The punishments meted out to the villains are funny, but many of them are also cruel. 
HOME ALONE 3

‽
‽Amistad‽,‽Midway through Steven Spielberg's ''Amistad'' and its long-overlooked story of a slave-ship mutiny and subsequent trial, the film finally presents the experience of captivity from the viewpoint of its main African character. He is the leader of this rebellion, the fierce figure who became known as Cinque. (His African name was Sengbe Pieh.) 
This somber-hued film erupts into lush color for a glimpse of Cinque's wife and child in their peaceful village, and sees him gaze warmly at their backs as they walk away from him forever. Then, with no warning, Cinque is ambushed and captured, destined to be sent halfway around the world. Viewers wishing to avoid waterworks can only be grateful that Mr. Spielberg denies the wife and child a backward glance. 
Power in Hollywood: a tired subject if ever there was one, but ''Amistad'' demonstrates what it really means. It's the ability to use images like this flashback, and like the stark, agonizing depiction of the captives' Atlantic crossing right afterward, to create the full empathy and immediacy this subject matter deserves. It's the creative means to bring any experience home to an audience, whether it comes from a faraway planet or from our underexplored past. It's the ability to make a $75 million holiday movie about a shameful chapter in American history simply because one thinks that's the right thing to do. 
Thus the worthiness of ''Amistad'' is irrefutable, as are its credentials despite the current legal uproar over source material. After all, this is a film featuring a cameo appearance by a former Justice of the Supreme Court (Harry A. Blackmun, seen briefly as the Justice rendering an 1841 decision). It has excellent cinematography (by Janusz Kaminski) with an avowed debt to Goya. It had Dr. Clifton Johnson, creator of the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University in New Orleans, to advise the filmmakers on African tribal life and translate portions of dialogue into the Mende dialect. It has two Academy Award nominees (one a winner) cast as American Presidents. Its authenticity is so earnest that it has real African actors shackled in real chains. 
But what the estimable ''Amistad'' does not have is an Oskar Schindler. It has no three-dimensional major character through whose flawed human nature an unimaginable atrocity can be understood. Dwarfed by the enormity of what it means to illustrate, the diffuse ''Amistad'' divides its energies among many concerns: the pain and strangeness of the captives'  experience, the Presidential election in which they become a factor, the stirrings of civil war, and the great many bewhiskered abolitionists and legal representatives who argue about their fate. The specific, as in Cinque's being torn from his family, is overwhelmed by generality. And this is a film in which John Quincy Adams, played by Anthony Hopkins as a wise old curmudgeon faithfully devoted to his houseplants, is the zestiest character by far. 
''Amistad'' dares to begin on a mythic note, starting with furious images of shipboard mutiny. Lurid as this is, it soon gives way to the more straightforward storytelling that Mr. Spielberg handles with greater ease. En route, the captives rebel and take control of the Spanish ship that is outrageously named La Amistad (Friendship), hoping to return home to Africa. 
Instead, they are tricked into unfriendly waters. Mr. Spielberg illustrates this handily with a passing vessel carrying genteel partygoers and musicians, to the Africans' astonishment. When the Amistad approaches what is supposed to be African coastline, a man riding a bicycle comes into view. 
Jailed in New England and put on trial, the Africans remain a mostly undifferentiated group except for Cinque. A language barrier also separates them from much of the film's main action, although the Steven Spielberg of ''E.T.'' knows winsome ways of showing what it means to be a stranger. 
The Africans are baffled by the hymn singing of grim abolitionists, whom they mistake for bad entertainers. They are also horrified by Matthew McConaughey, as a lawyer whom they call Dung Scraper, and the audience may not react much more kindly. Amiable matinee idol that he is, Mr. McConaughey should cease and desist from affecting mannerisms from previous centuries or playing any more smart lawyers. 
With Stellan Skarsgard and the seriously underused Morgan Freeman as top-hatted abolitionists, Anna Paquin as the giddy 11-year-old Spanish Queen who claims the Africans as her property, David Paymer as a Secretary of State, Pete Postlethwaite as the Government prosecutor making a case against the Africans and Nigel Hawthorne as President Martin Van Buren, ''Amistad'' has many an occasion for speeches and bons mots. But none of the rhetoric, not even the oratorical heights reached when John Quincy Adams takes on the Supreme Court, can compare with the Africans' story. And the best parts of ''Amistad'' are those that simply bring their pride, fear and outrage to life. 
As Cinque, the former model (and performer in Madonna and Janet Jackson videos) Djimon Hounsou gives the film a strong visual focus as he radiates extraordinary presence and fury. If all that he, Mr. Spielberg and ''Amistad'' accomplish is to secure for this story its place in history classrooms, that would suffice. Mr. Hounsou also acts his role quite movingly within the narrow confines of the screenplay credited to David Franzoni, a script whose fine points are now a matter of dispute. 
At least one point of contention, the helpful rapport that develops between Cinque and Adams, seems entirely organic to the movie. It doesn't take Barbara Chase-Riboud, the historical novelist who has accused the filmmakers of plagiarism, to see the storytelling value of letting these two opposites attract. 
''Amistad'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes necessary violence and brief nudity in its tough, sobering depictions of the captives' ordeal.

‽Mysteries of Egypt‽,‽Directed by Bruce Niebaur 
Not rated, 45 minutes 
''Mysteries of Egypt,'' a new Imax film produced in cooperation with National Geographic, is a convenient substitute for a trip to the country itself and a nice supplement to a visit to the mummy collection in your local museum. The five-story screen and the swooping aerial camera work convey the grandeur and majesty of the pyramids of Giza and the gigantic statues at Abu Simbel. And if the experience still does not quite match standing at the foot of the monuments themselves, it is also free of desert heat, souvenir hawkers and tour-bus exhaust. The sphinx and the pyramids seem to exist in a vast and timeless desert. The nearby Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise is nowhere to be seen. 
After a thrilling bird's-eye trip up the Nile, we settle into a Cairo cafe to learn about the most famous dead Egyptian -- the boy king Tutankhamen -- from one of his most famous living countrymen, Omar Sharif. Mr. Sharif, whose suave and civilized voice adds greatly to the film's charm, plays a Cairene instructing his American granddaughter (Kate Maberly) about the marvels of the ancient world and about Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the tombful of those marvels that had been sealed away for millenniums. 
Audiences are likely to be captivated by the lavish photography. How much they are engrossed by the content will likely depend on how much they already know. Like dinosaurs, which are similarly well-served by the big Imax screen, ancient Egypt is a subject of endless fascination for school-age children. This means that many of them will arrive at ''Mysteries of Egypt,'' which opens today at the Imax Theater at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street), with a certain dogmatic expertise, and may find the information it contains elementary and patronizingly presented. 
On the other hand this concise, sweeping survey of 4,000 years of civilization may attract a new generation of budding Egyptologists, much in the way that the ''Treasures of Tutankhamen'' exhibition did a generation ago. And young viewers seduced by the trashy flash of ''The Mummy'' and ''The Mummy Returns'' will be able to glimpse a vanished reality richer, stranger and bigger than all of the special effects in Hollywood.

‽Scrapple‽,‽Christopher Hanson's ''Scrapple'' is a completely uncondescending, nearly letter-perfect re-creation of a late 60's-early 70's stoner comedy. As such, it's a very strange cultural artifact, though not an unappealing one. It opens today for an exclusive run at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village. 
In reproducing the rambling tone, scruffy stylistics and laid-back attitude of such hazily if fondly remembered titles as Arthur Penn's ''Alice's Restaurant'' (1969) or Paul Williams's ''Dealing: Or the Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues'' (1972, from an early novel by Michael Crichton), Mr. Hanson has brought off an artistic stunt on the level of reconstructing Red Square out of toothpicks or building a Lego version of the Mona Lisa. 
The effort itself is so impressive that it eclipses any qualms one might have about the point of undertaking the exercise in the first place. Filming on location in and around the now uber-chic ski resort of Telluride, Colo., Mr. Hanson succeeds amazingly well in turning the clock back 30 years, to a time when Telluride (appearing here under the pseudonym of Ajax) was a remote outpost populated by ski bums, substance abusers and a few prescient real estate developers. 
Geoffrey Hanson, the director's brother as well as the movie's co-producer and one of its writers, stars as Al Dean, a bumbling, low-level pot dealer looking forward to a shipment of Nepalese Temple Balls (wads of hashish chewed by monks high in the Himalayas). Al hopes that the profits from his sales will allow him to buy a rundown house on Ajax's main street, where he'll be able to move with his disabled brother. (In the film's one hint of politics, Mr. Hanson suggests that the brother, confined to a V.A. hospital, is a Vietnam veteran.) 
Mr. Hanson contrasts the relatively pro-active Al with the utterly reactive Tom Sullivan (Buck Simmonds), a drifter who has never recovered from the death of his girlfriend in a skiing accident. Although Beth Muller (Ryan Massey), the local singer-songwriter, has taken more than a sisterly interest in him, Tom is still in a perpetual fugue state, hallucinating his ex's presence at inconvenient moments (when he wakes up with Beth, for instance) and doing his best to avoid commitment. 
The film's third focus of interest is the title character, a pig of ambiguous status -- pet or dinner? -- being raised by an Australian bartender (Bunzy Bunworth). The action, such as it is, is touched off when Scrapple devours Al's stock, forcing Al into an unholy alliance with a real estate agent (L. Kent Brown) whose real business is dealing cocaine. 
There is perhaps a metaphor here. Still, Mr. Hanson seems less interested in editorializing than in depicting lazy good times, like the half-hearted softball games that occasionally united the community, or the rock-climbing and motorcycle-riding expeditions that punctuate the plot for no particular dramatic reason. Even an unexpectedly violent denouement fails to disrupt the film's nostalgic vibe.

‽
‽The Well‽,‽The first half of ''The Well,'' the Australian director Samantha Lang's beautifully creepy debut feature, is an efficient study in the contrasting temperaments of two lonely women. Hester (Pamela Rabe), who lives with her father on a desolate sheep station, is the repressed one. We know this because of her long skirts and buttoned-up blouses, her orthopedic shoes and her flat, colorless hair, which she wears either severely plaited or gathered into a bun like the one Anthony Perkins sported in ''Psycho.'' Her taste in music runs to German lieder sung at dirge pace to the accompaniment of an out-of-tune upright piano. 
Katherine (Miranda Otto), her wayward young housekeeper, is the free spirit and resident life force. She loves loud rock music and likes to dance around in knee-high boots and short gauzy skirts. Her flaming red hair is the only splash of color on the dour, Victorian psychic landscape. 
But Hester loves Katherine. Or at least she buys her expensive gifts, excuses her from chores and learns, in her company, how to laugh. Bred in flinty pioneer thrift, Hester begins to spend money as if it were going out of style. She buys a brand-new silver Toyota pickup and, once her father dies, sells her childhood home and everything in it. Hester's disapproving financial adviser (Paul Chubb) suspects that Katherine has bewitched her, but the unlikely pair, along with two cookie tins full of cash, settle into a cozy cottage and begin fantasizing about a trip to Europe. 
Just as you begin to chafe at the obviousness of this setup, or to settle in for another hour of glum psychological atmospherics, Katherine runs over something -- which turns out to be someone -- on a deserted dirt road, and ''The Well,'' with a neck-snapping jolt, turns into the scariest exercise in cinematic sleight of hand since ''The Blair Witch Project.'' Soon there is a body to be disposed of, and the deep, dry well in front of the cottage offers itself as a practical solution and as a metaphor for the murky terror that is about to unfold. 
Katherine begins to insist that the man in the well is alive and that he has fallen in love with her. Surely she's come unhinged. Or maybe Hester, who either believes Katherine or doesn't, has gone over the edge. Or maybe you're the crazy one. Strange things begin to happen, unless nothing is happening at all. The story, adapted by Laura Jones from a novel by Elizabeth Jolley, is like a chain of slipknots, drawing ever tighter until one by one they disappear. 
Ms. Lang brings this puzzle to the screen with mathematical discipline and painterly emotion. She charges the smallest interactions with unbearable tension and knows how to induce panic by suggesting rather than showing. Like Peter Weir in ''Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' she turns the empty, windy outback into an actively sinister presence. 
Stumbling into ''The Well,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, you feel you've awakened into someone else's nightmare, and you emerge from it clammy with a dread you don't quite understand. See it with someone you trust. Or better, see it alone, since afterward you won't be able to trust anything, least of all your own perceptions.

‽
‽All I Wanna Do‽,‽The title of ''All I Wanna Do'' tells you nothing at all about the movie except, by inference, that it's for and about teenagers. Like ''She's All That,'' ''Down to You'' and ''Whatever It Takes,'' this innocuous, intermittently charming coming-of-age comedy has been given a name that refers to nothing at all, evokes no particular associations and is likely to be forgotten shortly after you leave the theater. 
But in this case, the title -- the third, after the more evocative but less marketable ''Strike'' and ''The Hairy Bird'' were scrapped -- seems especially inapt. ''All I Wanna Do,'' which opens today at the U.A. Union Square 14, takes place in 1963 at Miss Godard's, a proper New England boarding school for girls. In this milieu, if the script is to be trusted, young ladies expressed themselves crisply and grammatically, with occasional malapropisms and redundancies (''I loathe and abhor it'') thrown in for effect. 
Conducting this symphony of high diction is Lynn Redgrave as the school's embattled headmistress, whose grimacing upper-crustiness seems to have been learned from studying the accents of the millionaire and his wife on ''Gilligan's Island.'' Miss Godard's is the kind of place where Odette Sinclair (Gaby Hoffmann), newly arrived from Detroit with her horse in tow, soon earns a reputation among her peers for daring verbal wit because she says things like (I'm not kidding) ''up your ziggy with a wah-wah brush.'' 
''All I Wanna Do,'' the first feature directed by Sarah Kernochan, a screenwriter who has worked on such diverse projects as ''9 1/2  Weeks'' and ''Sommersby,'' mixes such prim old-fashioned naughtiness with more consequential misbehavior. Odette, a smart, politically astute young woman, soon joins a proto-feminist consciousness-raising group called the D.A.R. (Daughters of American Ravioli, in honor of the young women's favored snack, which they consume cold, straight from the can.) 
The daughters are the usual melange of teenage girl types: the slut (Monica Keena), the angry rich girl (Kirsten Dunst), the bulimic (Heather Matarazzo) and so on. They dream of becoming magazine editors and scientists, but Odette, who has the talent to become, in the words of one of her chums, ''a speechwriter or a demagogue,'' aspires to be an ''ex-virgin'' instead and enlists her pals in a conspiracy to arrange a clandestine tryst with her boyfriend, Dennis (Matthew Lawrence). 
The 60's arrive just in time. Miss Godard's is about to merge with a boys' school called St. Ambrose, and a faction of the D.A.R. mounts an ingenious (if slightly incredible) plot to preserve the school's identity. The film's politics seem a bit anachronistic, projecting a 1990's feminist critique of co-education onto a time in which ambitious young women were more likely to be agitating for admission to institutions reserved for men. 
But in any case ''All I Wanna Do'' is more fable than history. How else does one explain the presence of a gang of skinny, artsy townies who seem to be hanging around waiting to be cast as extras in the new Beck  video? 
''All I Wanna Do'' lurches between girl-power melodrama and bratty farce, but the ungainliness is part of the film's charm. Adolescence is an awkward time, and so were the 60's, for that matter. It's hard not to be won over by the spirited sloppiness of Ms. Kernochan and her cast, who gamely assay even the most stilted period absurdities of the script. Sometimes you think you're watching a finishing-school remake of ''Animal House,'' at others a made-for-the-WB version of ''The Group.'' 
But the film is surprisingly pleasant, thanks to smart, unstereotyped performances -- especially by Ms. Hoffmann and Ms. Dunst -- and the filmmaker's evident respect and affection for her characters. 
''All I Wanna Do'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some sexual references and situations, a good deal of vomiting (self-induced and otherwise) and the casual display of elaborate, historically accurate foundation garments.

‽
‽Secret Defense‽,‽For nearly three hours, Sandrine Bonnaire grimly mopes through ''Secret Defense,'' the French director Jacques Rivette's dreary contemporary retelling of the Electra myth. Ms. Bonnaire is Sylvie, a dour cancer researcher who is interrupted one day in her laboratory by her emotionally distraught younger brother Paul (Gregoire Colin), who arrives toting a gun. Insisting he has evidence that their father, who ran a guided-missile factory, was murdered by his right-hand man, Walser (Jerzy Radziwilowicz), Paul announces that he intends to avenge the crime. 
Paul is certain that their father, instead of accidentally falling from a moving train, was pushed. As proof, he produces a snapshot found among his father's belongings showing Walser, who claimed to be elsewhere, standing several feet from their father at the station platform shortly before his death. 
The screenplay, written by the director with Pascal Bonitzer and Emmanuelle Cuau, doesn't begin to make the details of the story credible. Yet the movie, which opens today at Anthology Film Archives, is reasonably well acted (Mr. Radziwilowicz's porcine Walser is a weirdly ambiguous semi-villain) and sustains an atmosphere of glum mistrust. 
Sylvie, deciding that her brother is too unstable to carry out the murder, decides to do it herself. And the scenes of the taut, nervous scientist determinedly boarding a series of trains on her way to kill Walser have a hypnotic suspense. Confronting Walser at his lavish country estate with its glowing red interiors, Sylvie draws a gun but is intercepted by his secretary and girlfriend Veronique (Laure Marsac). As the two women wrestle over the weapon, it goes off, accidentally killing Veronique. For the rest of the film -- and it has a long way to go -- Sylvie is so stricken with guilt and fear that she can barely speak. 
Walser, to Sylvie's amazement, disposes of Veronique's body and enlists her as an ally in covering up the death. Complicating matters is the arrival of Sylvie's younger sister Ludivine (Ms. Marsac). Walser's bizarre strategy for allaying Ludivine's possible suspicions is to promptly seduce her. It also develops that Sylvie's mother, Genevieve (Francoise Fabian) might somehow be in cahoots with Walser. But why? Might it have something to do with the death years many earlier of Sylvie's teenage sister Elizabeth? And why are the technicians at a top-secret project in Walser's company walking around in rubber space suits? 
As the glacially paced film inches forward with its halting conversations and accusatory glances, it tests your patience. And when the truth ultimately tumbles out and more violence erupts, don't expect a catharsis.

‽The Day of the Beast‽,‽If Quentin Tarantino had gotten his directorial hands on ''Rosemary's Baby'' or ''The Exorcist,'' the results might very well have resembled ''The Day of the Beast.'' 
Part black comedy, part lurid cartoon, part paranoid theological melodrama with a heavy metal undercurrent, this subtitled Spanish film arrives today at Cinema Village trailing half a dozen Goyas, the Spanish equivalents of Oscars. 
One of them, for best director, honored Alex de la Iglesia, who collaborated with Jorge Guerricaechavarria in writing this hyperthyroid tale of a scholarly priest, Father Angel (Alex Angula), whose studies of the Apocrypha have convinced him that the Antichrist is to be born in Madrid before dawn on Christmas. At its best, ''The Day of the Beast'' is comic in a casually brutal visual way, performed as if it matters, and never allows its swift pace to flag; at its least admirable, it loses its early comic touch and seems to revel in bloody violence that is all too familiar. 
With only hours to spare, in a city where babies have been disappearing, graves have been desecrated and roving bands have been beating and burning the homeless, the priest sets out to make contact with Satan, mortifying his flesh and selling his soul to try to find and kill the infant Antichrist and save humanity before the Devil can appear and establish his dominion. 
To this end, the priest, played by Mr. Angula with a beguiling mixture of wide-eyed innocence and relentless determination, enlists the hulking, shaggy, body-pierced, tattooed Jose Maria (Santiago Segura), the owner of a heavy metal record shop,  and, after some painful persuasian, Professor Cavan (Armando de Razza), a Mephistophelean-looking author and the host of ''The Dark Zone,'' a popular television program devoted to the occult. 
Along the way, in the boarding house owned by Jose Maria's shotgun-packing, cleaver-whacking mama, Rosario (Terele Pavez), the priest encounters her country-girl servant, Mina (Nathalie Sesena) and Rosario's frontally nude, mute father. And the plot calls upon the clergyman to draw blood from the virginal Mina, do in Rosario and suffer various beatings, a shotgun wound that shreds his ear and the music of a band called Satannica in a seething hellish dance club. 
That is not to overlook the capture of Susana (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), Cavan's voluptuous girlfriend; the beating and binding of Cavan, and a hair-raising escape along the side of a skyscraper from an early encounter with the Beast. 
Some of Mr. de la Iglesia's characters rebound like cartoon creatures from the mayhem visited on them; others remain very dead indeed. 
As theological adventures go, the over-the-top ''Day of the Beast'' adds up to a mixed blessing. 
''The Day of the Beast'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It involves bloody violence, nudity and coarse language. 
THE DAY OF THE BEAST 
Directed by Alex de la Iglesia; written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) by Jorge Guerricaechevarria and Mr. de la Iglesia; director of photography, Flavio Martinez Labiano; edited by Teresa Font; music by Battista Lena; produced by Ms. Font; released by Trimark Pictures. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village. Running time: 104 minutes. This film is rated R. 
WITH: Alex Angulo (Priest), Armando de Razza (Professor Cavan), Santiago Segura (Jose Maria), Terele Pavez (Rosario), Nathalie Sesena (Mina) and Maria Grazia Cucinotta (Susana).

‽Frogs for Snakes‽,‽Quentin Tarantino has already blasted himself a niche in cinema history, but his full impact on the gross national product may not be measurable until the last of his filmmaking disciples has exorcised the demon that impels them to imitate ''Pulp Fiction.'' 
The latest of these bloody black comedies is ''Frogs for Snakes,'' written and directed by Amos Poe. It tells the story of a group of lower Manhattan lowlifes circulating in the malign milieu of a corpulent loan shark who also happens to be a bit of a theatrical impresario. And all of his associates, lovers, ex-lovers, children and their friends yearn seriously to act. 
So here's the joke that is repeated throughout the film: for all of these people, killing or maiming is simply business. What really stirs their blood is the thought that someone else in this circle might get a part they covet or have the gall to choose a monologue in an audition or acting class that they regard as theirs. These are people who would literally kill for a role. 
Mr. Poe has assembled a fine cast, led by Barbara Hershey as Eva, and including people like John Leguizamo, Robbie Coltrane, Justin Theroux, Ron Perlman, Harry Hamlin, Debi Mazar and Lisa Marie. But in the end, after the oral sex monologue and the bouncing shotgunned head and the gallons of blood and the diner that have their ''Pulp Fiction'' counterparts, ''Frogs for Snakes'' remains derivative. 
Although surely not for delicate sensibilities, the film nonetheless maintains a consistent sense of macabre humor and delivers vivid performances. Ms. Hershey as the ex-wife of Al (Mr. Coltrane), the mother of their little boy, a sometime hit woman and occasional waitress, is the best actor of the lot but eager to escape to a better life. ''I don't kill people,'' she says to one of her targets. ''I maim them.'' 
Her determination is intensified after her lover, Zip (Mr. Leguizamo), is gunned down by Al's wheel man, U. B. (David Deblinger), whose zeal is heightened by his desire for a role in Al's next production, David Mamet's ''American Buffalo.'' 
''Frogs for Snakes'' begins intriguingly, but thereafter it is mostly recycled ''Pulp.'' 
''Frogs for Snakes'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains bloody violence, coarse language and simulated sex. 
FROGS FOR SNAKES

‽Testamento‽,‽What if the crucial events of anyone's biography are little more than quirks, accidents, lucky breaks and missed connections? That's the jaunty, absurdist view of existence offered by ''Testamento,'' a colorful, good-natured yarn that examines the life and times of Napumoceno da Silva Araujo (Nelson Xavier), the wealthiest man in Cape Verde. 
As the fictional character tells the story of his life on a series of cassettes bequeathed to his illegitimate daughter, Graca (Maria Ceica), the lucky turning point in his career begins with a clerical error involving a shipment of umbrellas. An aspiring import-export mogul from Cape Verde, the West African archipelago off the coast of Senegal, Araujo decides on a whim to import a thousand umbrellas. Although it hasn't rained for over a year there, he figures that eventually it will, and in any case the umbrellas can be sold for sunshade. 
But when the shipment arrives, thanks to a bumbling secretary's accidental insertion of an extra zero, there are 10,000. Convinced that he is ruined, Araujo begs everyone to pray for rain. Miraculously the heavens open, and a catastrophic deluge engulfs his home city of Mindelo. The umbrellas are quickly sold. Araujo, now suddenly wealthy, is toasted as a far-sighted business genius. 
Never mind that the notion of anyone becoming rich from the sale of 10,000 umbrellas doesn't add up. ''Testamento,'' adapted by Mario Prata from a novel by the Cape Verdean writer Germano Almeida and cast with Brazilian actors, is really a lighthearted parable about the mystery and comic unpredictability of life. Nobody in the movie gets what he expects. Araujo's greedy nephew Carlos (Chico Diaz), who appears to be Araujo's heir apparent, is devastated when his uncle leaves the bulk of his fortune to  Graca, a young woman he didn't know existed. 
Graca is as surprised as anyone by her windfall. Her mother, sworn to secrecy about her paternity, never told Graca that the creepy older man who used to follow her around, pestering her and offering her money  was really her father. To receive her  inheritance, Graca must move from her mother's home to Araujo's large estate and listen to her dead benefactor's taped reminiscences. The stories he tells are flashbacks that make up the heart of the movie. 
In accordance with its fanciful, phantasmagoric narrative, ''Testamento'' has been directed by Francisco Manso as an off-center surreal comedy whose larger-than-life characters seem to be having fun even when tearing out their hair in frustration. Mr. Xavier's Araujo is a fretting street-smart clown. Extremely self-regarding and wildly impulsive, he hangs a picture of himself on his office wall between a portrait of Abraham Lincoln and a  reproduction of the ''Mona Lisa.'' 
The movie makes much of his farcically sad love life, which begins with his impulsive seduction of Graca's mother on his office desk, continues with a stripper who gives him a venereal disease and culminates with his May-December romance with the mysterious Adelia (Karla Leal), a beautiful young woman who breaks his heart. 
''Testamento,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinemas, is so episodic it often feels like a series of disconnected vignettes. And not all the mysteries it uncovers are worth the buildup. With its lilting Cape Verdean folk score (including a song by the international star Cesaria Evora), the movie exudes the charm of a modern folk tale drawled over a lazy afternoon when there's nothing better to do than exchange tall stories.

‽Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane‽,‽Joe Carnahan's maniacally frenzied little film, ''Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' is set in the desert wasteland around Needles, Calif., where Sid (Mr. Carnahan) and his partner Bob (Dan Leis), two motor-mouthed used-car salesmen, are desperately trying to keep their failing business afloat. Just when they are about to throw in the towel, their sleazy broker hands them an opportunity to make $250,000 simply by letting a 1963 Pontiac LeMans sit in their lot for 48 hours. 
There's a deadly catch, of course. The car, which has been on a long intercontinental journey, will be under constant surveillance by gunslingers who have already left a trail of carnage behind them, and the vehicle is wired to explode should anyone attempt to open the trunk. No sooner has a deal been struck than Sid hatches the notion of stealing the Pontiac and holding it for $500,000 ransom. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. is hard on the trail of the car and its owners. 
''Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' runs on the movie equivalent of fake adrenaline. The story is continually interrupted and kicked into high gear by the flash of sardonic chapter titles and the kind of sonic blasts that punctuate items on tabloid news shows. Between chapter titles, the characters yammer at each other in dialogue that feels semi-improvised, and people get shot. Although the pair succeed in taking the hot car to a repair shop, where blood is discovered leaking from the bottom of the trunk, they don't get much farther than that. The grainy, jittery cinematography and flat deadpan performances give this preposterous scenario a patina of realism. 
The movie aspires to be a David Mamet-like slice of lowlife in the American wasteland with added Quentin Tarantino-like muscle-flexing and dripping gore. Desperate,  lying used car salesmen out for a big score; deadly macho games of gun-waving; suitcases stuffed with drugs and cash; absent women: do I hear a metaphor? It's all grindingly familiar and has been done by others with far more style and credibility. 
''Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and scenes of violence.

‽Six-String Samurai‽,‽In his debut film, ''Six-String Samurai,'' Lance Mungia doesn't have anything to say except that he has done his homework. And he says that stylishly in a shoestring movie that amounts to a kaleidoscopic calling card intended to show prospective employers that he can handle a variety of genres. 
As its title suggests, ''Six-String Samurai,'' written by Mr. Mungia and Jeffrey Falcon, its star, draws from Japan's samurai films as well as cinematic tales built around rock musicians. 
So besides ''The Buddy Holly Story'' and, say, ''Yojimbo,'' Mr. Mungia's film is littered with elements of post-apocalyptic road movies, buddy adventures, odd-couple comedies, spaghetti westerns, Death in the style of Ingmar Bergman, ''Star Wars,'' ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' low-budget 1950's cold war sci-fi chillers, war films and, of course, the ineluctable ''Wizard of Oz,'' all to the accompaniment of a sprightly rock score by the Red Elvises, a group of Russian-born musicians. 
''Six-String Samurai,'' which Mr. Mungia says traces its origins to his effort to create an undergraduate thesis film, tells the story of Buddy (Mr. Falcon) and the Kid (Justin McGuire). Set in 1957, after an atomic war has devastated the United States and led to Russian occupation, it puts Buddy on the road to Lost Vegas, the last bastion of freedom, where a successor to Elvis, the dead King, is to be chosen. 
Buddy, packing a guitar and a samurai sword, and dressed in a tattered dark suit and accessorized with the heavy black-framed eyeglasses that recall Buddy Holly, is bound for Lost Vegas along a road filled with lethal and musical rivals when he encounters and saves the Kid from the bad guys who have just killed his mother. 
The laconic Buddy would like the Kid to get lost, but no such luck. Soon they are headed for Lost Vegas, through assorted villains and perils, including Death and his henchmen. 
Filmed mostly in Death Valley, with Kristian Bernier as cinematographer, ''Six-String Samurai'' depicts its harsh landscape with a sharp, clear eye and recounts its silly, derivative tale with tongue firmly in cheek. 
But it remains an apprentice work that leaves the hope that Mr. Mungia's scholarship, perseverance and technical skills will someday be applied to more original material. 
''Six-String Samurai'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Although menace is prevalent and the body count is high, most of the violence in this film is highly stylized, and blood, while evident, is minimal. 
SIX-STRING SAMURAI

‽Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore‽,‽Every American city has its band of young, self-styled outsiders. And in the unidentified Bible Belt town that is the setting for Sarah Jacobson's crude, heartfelt movie ''Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore,'' they all seem to work in the same seedy local movie theater. The modes of teen-age and post-teen-age rebellion on display aren't especially exotic. Hard drinking, sleeping around, some bisexuality and cautious body piercing are the chief manifestations of nonconformism among the staff. 
The movie follows the adventures of Mary Jane (Lisa Gerstein), a high school senior from a ''nice'' suburb who takes a part-time job working the popcorn machine and learns some useful life lessons while hanging out with this not-so-wild bunch. 
Jane, as she is called, may come from a protected background, but when upset she can curse like a truck driver. Much of her venom is aimed at Steve (Shane Kramer), a leather-jacketed young man who in the movie's opening scene is shown deflowering her in a cemetery while she cries out in pain and anger. Her leftover rage is directed toward Matt (Andrew David DeAngelo), an obnoxious, alcoholic, male chauvinist and self-proclaimed stud whom all the women on the premises agree is an inept, inconsiderate (and when drunk, which is most of the time) impotent lover. 
The movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, is a homemade affair by Ms. Jacobson, who wrote, directed, edited and produced it. While it has a certain polemical force, its story feels slapped together and the acting ranges from the competent to the amateurish. 
The fuel that drives ''Mary Jane'' is the film maker's anger at male sexual selfishness, women's ignorance of their own bodies and a culture that encourages women to lie about their sexual pleasure. In the course of travels, Jane learns about self-pleasure from a bisexual co-worker named Ericka (Beth Ramona Allen), who has her own punk band, and experiences nonpenetrative bliss with Tom (Chris Enright), the staff's resident dreamboat. Once she feels more self-confidence, Jane gleefully engineers the awful Steve's humiliating comeuppance. 
Ms. Gerstein, who bares a striking physical and vocal resemblance to Kathy Najimy, looks and acts a bit older than 17. In a movie that translates the sexual gospel according to Dr. Ruth Westheimer into a kind of punk-rock sermon on sexual etiquette, Ms. Gerstein gives a blunt, feisty performance.

‽Port Djema‽,‽Eric Heumann has a way with violence. In his new film, ''Port Djema,'' the sound of a single gunshot on the nearly empty streets of an African town is absolutely horrifying. Mr. Heumann conveys a suddenness and an immediacy to the gunfire that the average Hollywood action thriller, with thousands of rounds of ammunition, can't achieve. ''Port Djema'' has a great sense of the sinister; too bad the rest of it is so shapeless. 
Pierre Feldman (Jean-Yves Dubois), a French surgeon with better things to do, travels to Port Djema, a fictional African nation, because he made a promise to a dear friend, a doctor who was recently killed there. The promise was to locate one particular child and see that he was cared for. The film purports to have a plot, but it's only a riddle (who is the mystery child?), introduced briefly and almost immediately solved and tossed away. 
But Pierre does set out on the search, in the middle of the country's ethnic civil war, with the child's photograph in hand. In the process he meets a woman who photographs the shadows of palm trees (Nathalie Boutefeu), deals with corruption and life-threatening hostility and comes face to face with the country's desperate need for medical care, particularly for the children. Will Pierre stay and help or get out while the getting's good? The suspense about this decision lasts two minutes at most. 
Mr. Heumann, a producer of films like ''Indochine'' and ''Ulysses' Gaze,'' directed ''Port Djema'' and was one of its writers, along with Jacques Lebas, a French doctor. From 1988 to 1991, Dr. Lebas ran a humanitarian medical organization that did work in Lebanon, Cambodia, Romania and what was then the Soviet Union. He has said that one of the purposes of the film is to transmit ''something of the questions raised by contacts with the world's wounds.'' 
''Port Djema'' doesn't go nearly deep enough into its characters or its situations for real insight, but it does have some lovely, artful cinematography and a heart of gold.

‽Down in the Delta‽,‽What a wonderful world it would be if every American family had older relatives as wise, kind, generous and stern (when necessary) as Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) and Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), the heroes of Maya Angelou's unabashedly inspirational film ''Down In the Delta.'' Together this sister and brother gently and methodically heal the wounded spirit of a Chicago inner-city household on the verge of disintegration, and in the process save their proud family line from possible extinction. 
The movie, which often threatens to disappear into a tub of soapsuds, is elevated immeasurably by the calm, stately performances of Mary Alice and Mr. Freeman. These two fine actors lend their roles a gravity, balance and underlying sense of sorrow that convince you such noble souls really do exist in the world, even if they're few and far between. 
If the term ''family values'' has a taint of right-wing intolerance nowadays, the movie reminds you of what those values, shorn of political ideology, really mean in terms of caring, self-sacrifice and the nurturing of tradition through the honoring of one's ancestors. 
''Down in the Delta,'' which Ms. Angelou directed (it is the poet's debut behind the camera) from a screenplay by Myron Goble, doesn't pretend that love and devotion alone can do the job. When it becomes apparent to Rosa Lynn that her daughter Loretta (Alfre Woodward), her grandson Thomas (Mpho Koaho) and autistic granddaughter Tracy (Kulani Hassen) are in imminent danger of succumbing to the drug-and-gun infested street culture of Chicago, she takes drastic action. Telephoning her brother in Mississippi, she announces that she is sending her daughter and grandchildren south for the summer to stay with him. 
To pay for the journey, Rosa Lynn pawns a priceless heirloom, a sterling silver candelabrum named Nathan that has been in the family for generations. As ''Nathan's'' story comes out in bits and pieces, it becomes a larger-than-life myth (illustrated with flashbacks to slavery times) exemplifying the family's continuity in the face of adversity. 
That story gives ''Down in the Delta'' a resonance that transcends mushy family drama and lends it the aura of a folk tale. Family legends that connect us to our past, the movie  suggests, are necessary for the care and feeding of our souls. 
If ''Down in the Delta'' portrays some moments of family strife, they are very muted in a film that is really an idyllic celebration of a return to one's roots. Even in its relatively gritty early scenes in Chicago, in which Loretta, rejected for a cashier's job because she hasn't learned arithmetic, goes directly from her job interview to a liquor store and from there to a crack house, the edges are softened. Almost as soon as Loretta and her children have settled comfortably in Earl's sprawling house in rural Mississippi, her hard shell begins to melt. 
The film lavishes equal amounts of love on the bucolic Mississippi landscape and on the kind, careworn faces of Earl and his wife, Annie (Esther Rolle), who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Freeman's Earl is a man of infinite patience and tenderness, and the scenes of his gently, painstakingly helping his wife around the house and comforting her when she is afraid are among the rare moments to be found in a contemporary movie in which you see older people caring for one another. 
Earl devotes the same care to Loretta, whom he hires as a waitress in the local restaurant he owns, an establishment called Just Chicken. Also popping up on the homestead is the couple's strapping grown-up son Will (Wesley Snipes), a successful Atlanta lawyer who gives his cousin some useful lessons in self-esteem. 
''Down in the Delta'' may be an impossible dream, a cinematic Hallmark card of familial togetherness, but the vision it offers is still a dream worth dreaming. 
''Down in the Delta'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity and a brief scene in a crack house.

‽The Faculty‽,‽Like Frankenstein, ''The Faculty'' plunders the crypts of cinema for its body parts. Here are the paranoia and parasitism of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' There are the slimy, sharp-toothed creatures of ''Alien.'' And over there are the movie-wise teen-agers of ''Scream.'' 
The list could be extended, but the point is clear: this mediocre sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on world domination breaks no new ground. But it has an engaging cast, with half a dozen appealing young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain moviegoers know it. 
In one of the film's wittier passages, the six high school students puzzling out the mysteries of a small new creature found on a football field, a teacher's corpse in a closet and a sudden outbreak of docility among their normally brutish and dysfunctional schoolmates speculate that paranoid movies of the past may have been part of a plot to soften up the public for the real invasion of the body snatchers. 
By contrast, ''The Faculty,'' directed by Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include ''El Mariachi'' and ''Desperado,'' and written by the ubiquitous Kevin Williams of the ''Scream'' movies and other adolescent adventures, opens with a clunky, bloody, cheap-thrills sequence that colors what happens afterward with triteness. 
So the chief pleasures of the film, such as they are, remain the actors: Jordana Brewster as Delilah, the beauteous, tart-tongued cheerleader captain and editor in chief of the school newspaper; Shawn Hatosky as Stan, her soon-to-be former boyfriend, the quarterback and captain of the Herrington High football team,  who is undergoing a pre-midlife crisis and hanging up his pads; Clea DuVall, as Stokely, the unhappy loner and science-fiction aficionado whom Delilah taunts as a lesbian; Laura Harris as Marybeth, the sweet blond Southern belle who is the new girl in school; Josh Hartnett as the cool Zeke, who peddles homemade inhalable substances, condoms and  fake ID's, among other wares, but happens to be a science genius, and Elijah Wood as Casey, the decent little victim of the school bullies, who turns out just fine. 
The adults aren't bad, either: Salma Hayek, all but hidden behind her tissues as the sniffling school nurse; Bebe Neuwirth as Principal Drake; Famke Janssen as a seemingly shy teacher; Piper Laurie as a senior faculty member, and Robert Patrick (the indefatigable villain of ''Terminator 2'') as the volatile Coach Willis. 
Herrington High is one of those schools that, as Principal Drake explains at the outset, has no money for new computers, a class trip to New York City or a school musical this year, but can come up with cash for all the new football equipment its team needs. 
The locals, she explains, are football people. 
And if ''The Faculty'' is the only movie they see his year, maybe they can be fooled into believing that it is fresh and frightening. 
''The Faculty'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes bloody violence, foul language, inhalation of mood-altering substances and nudity.

‽
‽Mighty Joe Young‽,‽For all the technological expertise behind the 2-ton, 15-foot animatronic ape (augmented by an actor in a monkey suit) who is the title character of ''Mighty Joe Young,'' the beast is still capable of only two facial expressions. When riled, Joe roars, bares his teeth, beats his chest and acts like a conventional movie monster on the rampage. In a calmer mode, embracing his caretaker, Jill Young (Charlize Theron), in his giant paws, Joe turns his mouth down in an expression of childlike docility. 
In his heart of hearts, the darling creature is really just a hirsute little boy pining for the closest thing he knows to a mommy. As long as Jill is around, you can count on him to be a sweetly obedient child following the signals of a flashlight she uses to direct him like a conductor on a podium. 
The film, a remake of the 1949 movie ''Mighty Joe Young,'' starring Terry Moore as Joe's cheesecakey mother surrogate, is essentially ''King Kong'' for kids. Very young kids. The familiar story begins when Jill is a child growing up in Central Africa. One terrible night, both Jill's mother and the mother of the baby ape who grows up to be Joe are killed by evil poachers, but not before Joe has bitten off two fingers from a hand of one of the villains. 
We flash ahead two decades. Little Jill is now Big Jill, a slinky, tomboyish woman who is fiercely protective of her childhood pet, with whom she enjoys playing games of hide and seek. Joe's enormous size has made him a legend, and poachers and zoo keepers from around the world have their eye on him. 
Arriving just in time to save the ape from probable kidnaping is Gregg (Bill Paxton), a kindly American zoologist who persuades Jill to let him transport the beast to an animal conservancy in Los Angeles. Jill agrees on the condition that she remain Joe's caretaker. 
Recognizing Joe from news articles as the ape that cost him his fingers many years earlier, Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia), the poacher who killed Joe's mother and who now  runs his own conservancy in Botswana, descends on Los Angeles, bent on capturing Joe. Apes, like elephants, the movie suggests, never forget. And when Joe spies his mother's killer, he begins acting up. Not even Jill can figure out what's the matter. 
The movie culminates in Joe's going on a mild rampage through the streets of Los Angeles. Compared with ''Godzilla'' or ''King Kong,'' it's very tame stuff, and the only people who get hurt are the bad guys. That's because Joe is essentially an angelic child who identifies with angelic kiddies everywhere. He becomes a hero after risking his life to save a saucer-eyed little tyke trapped in the top car of a burning ferris wheel. 
''Mighty Joe Young,'' directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves. Little children won't notice. In Joe, they can identify with the biggest, cuddliest simian toy a 6-year-old could ever hope to own. 
''Mighty Joe Young'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its early scenes of animal slaughter could frighten young children.

‽
‽Hurlyburly‽,‽''So what kind of friendship is this?'' pleads Eddie (Sean Penn) to his suave housemate, Mickey (Kevin Spacey), in David Rabe's pitch-black comedy ''Hurlyburly.'' 
''Adequate,'' Mickey replies with a shrug. 
No, there's hardly any nurture in the friendships shown in the teeth-grinding Hollywood shark tank of ''Hurlyburly.'' 
In evoking the casual cruelty of contemporary life in a certain time and place, this screen adaptation of David Rabe's play is a misanthropic triumph. The film, which takes place ''a little while ago,'' is set in a movie-industry milieu that feels like the 1980's, when the play was first produced and when cocaine was still conspicuously fashionable in Hollywood. In this toxic social climate, friendships are duplicitous power games and male-female encounters ugly skirmishes in a never-ending series of battles. 
The main characters in this bilious study of macho camaraderie, sexual exploitation and substance abuse are Eddie, a casting director coming apart from drugs and alcohol, and his cool, sarcastic business partner and roommate, Mickey. These two party animals share a sleek mirror-and-glass-filled condominium in the Hollywood Hills. As the movie begins on a morning of runny noses and hacking coughs, the only breakfast food in the refrigerator turns out to be a package of moldy Snowballs. 
Mr. Penn's Eddie is a whiny, hysterical motor-mouth, a sort of improvisatory philosopher of doom whose unstrung rants are inspired by television images gleaned from his compulsive channel-surfing. Blond and reptilian, Mr. Spacey's Mickey gazes at the world through hooded eyes, his mouth curled in a supercilious sneer. 
What kind of friendship do they have? On this particular morning, the atmosphere is sharpened by Eddie's certainty that his sometime girlfriend, Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), has just slept with Mickey. As the friends argue by car phone, Mickey calmly reminds Eddie that he gave him tacit permission to sleep with Darlene when he announced that ''everybody's free.'' 
Dropping by the house to snort cocaine, smoke dope and swap nasty sexual war stories are Artie (Garry Shandling), a beady-eyed Hollywood bigwig, and Phil (Chazz Palminteri), a thuggish would-be actor with ''three kids in Toledo I haven't seen since I went to prison.'' One afternoon Artie brings his buddies a sexual ''care package'' in the person of Donna (Anna Paquin), a brash, itinerant teen-ager he met in an elevator. 
Phil, a human pit bull who idolizes Eddie, is desperate to save his unraveling marriage to a wife he has been regularly beating up. Should he stop taking pills to reduce his sperm count and give her the baby she craves? In the movie's chilliest moment, after that child has arrived, Artie picks up the baby girl and marvels at the fact that ''this sweet little thing, this innocent little thing, guys, this is a broad of the future.'' 
That tender moment arrives long after Eddie has fixed up Phil on a disastrous blind date with Bonnie (Meg Ryan), a stripper, single mother and self-described ''drug person'' who in another of the movie's nastier moments is recalled having had sex in the back seat of a car while her traumatized 6-year-old daughter looked on. 
As directed by Anthony Drazen, ''Hurlyburly'' has been opened up somewhat. (A crucial act of violence not shown in the play is portrayed in the movie.) The film nevertheless still captures the play's claustrophobic sense of being trapped in a smoke-filled room with people who might explode at any second. 
The film's close-up photography magnifies every reddened eyelid and plume of cigarette smoke. After a while the images of dissipated faces and the rhythm of the characters' aimless, ugly, hard-boiled banter settles into a woozy, sodden tango of word and image. These are people most of us would rather not be in the same room with, but the movie shoves them in our faces. 
The ensemble acting surpasses that of any other film this year. Mr. Penn, his face swollen and crumpling, his voice rising in childish hysteria, burrows so deeply into Eddie that he almost vomits his character onto the screen. Mr. Spacey's cobralike Mickey is as slippery and cool as Mr. Penn's Eddie is volatile, while Mr. Shandling's Artie is the loathsome distillation of a particularly repulsive kind of sleaze: think Larry Sanders without charm or scruples. 
Mr. Palminteri, in a heaving, tragic performance that matches Harvey Keitel's stage original, finds the vestige of a soul under the leathery skin of a stupid, compulsively violent thug with delusions of talent. 
''Hurlyburly'' has been called sexist because of its female characters' slatternly eagerness to gratify these misogynists. Yet each of the film's three women is capable of standing up for herself. Ms. Wright brings a defensive sang-froid to Darlene, whose dispassionate attitude toward sex drives Eddie into a frenzy. (In a ghastly comic set piece, her refusal to choose between a French and a Chinese restaurant sets him off.) Ms. Ryan, muting her customary perkiness, finds a core of pugnacious resilience under Bonnie's bleary-eyed dishevelment. Ms. Paquin's Donna (the least credible of the three women) also has a prickly edge of defiance. 
As it traces Eddie's downward spiral, ''Hurlyburly'' touches on many themes. But above all, it is a contemplation of male friendship and power that proposes the existence of an immutable pecking order. As Mickey is to Eddie (superior, condescending, and betraying), so Eddie is to Phil. Or as Mickey coldly assures Eddie, ''Phil is very safe, because no matter how far you manage to fall, Phil will be lower.'' 
In this bleak vision of male bonding, the quest for dominance (or if not dominance, approval from above) is so all-consuming that women are little more than trophies and bargaining chips. The war between men and women, the movie proposes, is only an offshoot of a larger and more deadly war: the one waged by men against themselves. 
''Hurlyburly'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of profanity, some violence, and sexual situations.

‽Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras‽,‽Directed by Mike Lyddon, Will Frank and Karl DeMolay 
Not rated, 75 minutes 
Mardi Gras in New Orleans, a time of masquerade, has yielded up a film masquerading as achievement. 
Amateurish and incoherent, ''Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras'' is said by its publicity to have been made on a $5,000 budget, which seems largely to have been misspent. The money has bought a tedious, crude-looking, crudely contrived, mostly black-and-white mess that tries to mingle horror, comedy and homages to far better filmmakers in a disjointed story about a ravenous zombie on the loose in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. 
Tossed into the mix are a documentary film crew, a couple out of a French film (accompanied by subtitles), alileo loosed from purgatory on a mission to stop the zombie and the Mardi Gras itself, from parades, floats and musicians to, whenever possible, bare-breasted women. 
The juvenile ideas of comedy run to toilet humor; the acting seems unworthy of the name, and as a whole the film, which opens today at Den of Cin at Two Boots Video 44 (Avenue A, near East Third Street, East Village), is sluggish and starved for style and originality. 
''Zombie! vs. Mardi Gras'' was produced, directed and written by Mike Lyddon, Karl DeMolay and Will Frank. The film may fancy itself to be an ''in'' joke. It is in fact a sore trial.   LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

‽Galapagos‽,‽In 1835, Charles Darwin visited the Galápagos Islands, a small archipelago off Ecuador, in the H.M.S. Beagle, and the curious species of bird, lizard and tortoise he found there helped him formulate the theory of natural selection. 
A marine biologist named Carole Baldwin visited these islands 163 years later on the research vessel Seward Johnson, taking along equipment that Darwin would have envied, including a high-tech bathysphere and a pair of Imax 3-D cameras. 
Darwin recorded his discoveries in notebooks and later published them in ''The Voyage of the Beagle.'' What Dr. Baldwin saw on the islands, and at the bottom of the nearby ocean, can be seen in ''Galápagos,'' a 40-minute feature that opens today at the Loews Imax Theater at Lincoln Square. 
The Imax three-dimensional format might have been designed for a future stage of human evolution. Its enormous screen exceeds the capacities of the human eye: you can never see the whole image, and so you dwell inside it, in the jagged foreground of a deep, flat picture. It's a nice way to experience the wonders of the natural world, though you may wish that Mark Isham's score didn't overwhelm the crashing of the surf and that the filmmakers, Al Giddings and David Clark, had refrained from manufacturing silly fish noises. 
The narration, read by Kenneth Branagh, proclaims the wonder and variety of life, though it's a bit light on information, not quite rising to the level of a PBS nature documentary or an interactive display at the American Museum of Natural History. And though Imax projection certainly renders the strange creatures and dramatic rock formations of Galápagos larger than life, it also makes them seem a little less real. Still, it's hard to resist the lumbering Galápagos tortoise, the skittering bright-orange crabs or the legions of proud black marine iguanas that sun themselves en masse on outcroppings of petrified lava. 
Darwin, for the most part, kept to the land, studying the islands' marine life through a glass-bottomed bucket. But Dr. Baldwin, and ''Galápagos,'' soon forsake the shore for deep water, where the film's most fascinating parts take place. First, we visit relatively shallow reefs that swarm with silvery fish and hammerhead sharks, and then, in the Johnson Sea-Link, a deep-water vessel Jules Verne might have dreamed up, we proceed to the lightless depths 3,000 feet below the surface. There, Dr. Baldwin, aided by the Sea-Link's vacuum-tube arms, collects strange squishy things, some of which have apparently never been glimpsed by human eyes. One of them, a spiny, popeyed fish, almost looks affronted by the intrusion, and alarmed by the prospect of imminent celebrity.

‽
‽Pariah‽,‽''Pariah,'' which begins a weeklong engagement at the Screening Room tonight, opens with the voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. warning that ''racism is a sickness unto death.'' But this new film by Randolph Kret mistakes the study of a particularly virulent set of symptoms for a diagnosis. 
There is no doubt that the Southern California skinheads who rampage through the movie are sick people. When they are not spewing obscenities at blacks, gays and one another or committing acts of wanton brutality against blacks, gays and one another, they are apt to be recalling lives of loneliness and abuse. But having discovered these pathologically angry souls, Mr. Kret, who directed ''Pariah'' from his own script, seems unsure about what to do with them. 
What he tries to do is send an outsider into their ugly little world. Steve (Damon Jones) is a quiet white grad student type whose world is shattered when the skinheads attack him and his African-American girlfriend, Sam (Elexa Williams). Sam, gang-raped while Steve is forced to look on helplessly, goes home, cuts her wrists and dies. Steve decides to take revenge. But first he shaves his head, dons red suspenders and an angry scowl and decorates his arms with Nazi tattoos. 
The idea of an ordinary, tolerant white person going undercover into a world of extreme race-hatred is a promising one. (It was the subject of Costa-Gravas's interesting 1988 film ''Betrayed,'' starring Debra Winger and Tom Berenger.) But to bring the idea to life requires a script and an actor capable of conveying the psychological complications such a journey must entail. 
Steve's motives are never made very clear. Why didn't he call the police? (The answer seems to be that Los Angeles, despite being overrun by gangs of marauding youths who carry out their attacks in broad daylight, doesn't have any.) And why, if he's so inclined, doesn't Steve just track his assailants down and kill them? Why would he want to make friends with them first? His decision is presented as if it were the most natural response to what has befallen him and yet on reflection it seems completely absurd. 
For his part Mr. Jones, a slow-moving, passive screen presence, doesn't adequately register the nuances of guilt, rage and curiosity his character needs to hold our interest or elicit our sympathy. 
Nuance is not something Mr. Kret has much use for. The lives of the skinheads are so nasty and brutish that it seems hard to imagine that any young person, however alienated or ideologically zealous, would want to go near them. 
And in a misguided attempt to give the film some political balance and complexity, Mr. Kret conjures up a group of hyped-up, violent young black men (the only black male characters in the movie), who drive around the city terrorizing whites and who introduce gunfire where before there had been bats, fists and knives. This gang and the mob of vengeful gays who later lay waste to the skinheads' crash pad are on hand to make the point that the world is trapped in a cycle of retributive violence. 
There is no doubt that ''Pariah'' is a relentlessly violent film. It is also simplistic, repetitive and morally confused. Mr. Kret clearly wants to generate an atmosphere of assaultive intensity, but after a while the raised voices and pounding fists induce a kind of weary numbness. The only real charge comes from the soundtrack, which features some terrific songs by antiracist hardcore bands like Minor Threat, Social Unrest and the Wives. 
With the exception of the attack on Steve and Sam, the scenes of violence tend to be sloppily filmed and loosely edited, and the sheer number of them further dilutes their effectiveness. Matters are not helped by the acting, which ranges from almost credible (Aimee Chaffin as the chief skinhead's moll; David Lee Wilson as his sociopathic sidekick) to unwatchable (Ann Zupa as a neurotic fat girl; Anna Padgett as a skittish junkie; Brandon Slater as the gang's mentally retarded mascot). 
Racist extremism is a problem. We need movies that address it. Chances are you already agree with these propositions. All ''Pariah'' succeeds in doing is screaming them at you, at maximum volume, over and over and over.

‽The Talented Mr. Ripley‽,‽A FLOOD of adjectives bursts onto the screen at the start of Anthony Minghella's glittering new thriller, considering ways to describe Tom Ripley before settling on ''talented'' as le mot juste. This is only a minuscule show of ingenuity, but it's also a promise that the film will keep. ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' offers diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look. 
Its opening credit sequence alone is a model of exquisitely economical suggestion, showing how the loan of a jacket with a Princeton insignia leads Tom from the life of a New York City men's room attendant to a thrillingly new world of opportunity. In a rush of gorgeous, agile exposition, Tom winds up in Europe, learning to say ''This is my face'' in Italian as he trains his binoculars on Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie is the spectacularly charismatic dilettante whose life Tom will eventually steal. 
''I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors,'' remarks the chauffeur who drives Tom away from a bleak Manhattan neighborhood and hands him his first-class ticket for an ocean passage. In light of the mind games that the movie has in store, both the remark and the carnal high-low contrast (meat hangs on hooks near the limousine) are as splendidly barbed as they can be. 
As a playwright and television writer who came to filmmaking with two comparatively modest, whimsical efforts (''Truly, Madly, Deeply'' and ''Mr. Wonderful'') before the exponential leap of ''The English Patient,'' Mr. Minghella now establishes that his Oscar-winning triumph was no fluke. His hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story has the same kind of complex allure that made ''The English Patient'' so mesmerizing. 
This is a more conventional opportunity, being essentially the story of a homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps. But Mr. Minghella, who wrote and directed ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with acute attention to every nuance, significantly broadens what Ms. Highsmith had in mind. Adding a couple of important new characters and bringing the secrets of Tom's sexual longings to the surface, he risks losing the profound chill that made Ripley so disturbing in the first place. The character is several shades less loathsome and more conscience-stricken than he was to begin with, and his homosexuality is more openly expressed. But as played by Matt Damon with a fine, tricky mix of obsequiousness and ruthlessness, the nicer new Ripley is in no danger of losing his sting. 
In a scenic, voluptuously beautiful film (kudos to the cinematographer, John Seale) that has a traffic-stopping cast, Mr. Minghella carefully plants the seeds of mayhem. When Tom is hired by Dickie's father (James Rebhorn) to bring the ne'er-do-well Greenleaf scion home from Italy, he contrives to bump into Dickie on the beach and to echo Dickie's infatuation with American jazz. The year is 1958, and it seems an impossibly glamorous time as depicted among pampered American expatriates in some of Italy's most breathtaking settings. 
Tom's tricks, from wearing an embarrassingly skimpy chartreuse bathing suit to casually flashing some of Dickie's favorite record albums, neatly accomplish their purpose. Soon he has made himself Dickie's latest diversion, and managed this without even alienating Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), Dickie's girlfriend. Marge was a thick, lumpen target for Tom's misogyny in Ms. Highsmith's version. Here, though still hopelessly oblivious to sexual currents between the men, she becomes a reminder that Ms. Paltrow makes as savvy a character actress as she does a swanlike leading lady. 
A word about the film's Dickie Greenleaf: this is a star-making role for the preternaturally talented English actor Jude Law. Beyond being devastatingly good-looking, Mr. Law gives Dickie the manic, teasing powers of manipulation that make him ardently courted by every man or woman he knows. During the first half of the film, Dickie is pure eros and adrenaline, a combination not many actors could handle with this much aplomb. 
During one especially sharp-edged scene here, as the tensions surrounding Dickie approach the unbearable, the handsome heir indulges in what he dismissively calls ''Marge maintenance'' on his sailboat. Leaving Tom and another rich crony, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman, scene-stealingly wonderful here), to wait uneasily during this sexual interlude, Dickie avidly plays off each passenger on the boat against the others. Something has to give. 
When it does, in the deadly encounter that sends Tom Ripley into his new life, the film changes greatly in tone. Once its touristy idyll is over, ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' becomes an elaborate round of gamesmanship about Tom's sleight of hand and how it can be sustained. The ruse, which Mr. Damon handles coyly and credibly, if not with the nascent Norman Bates streak that the situation warrants, is given an added complication by the presence of Meredith Logue. Meredith is a needy post-debutante played irresistibly by Cate Blanchett. Once Meredith latches onto Tom, who she thinks is Dickie, whom she regards as a bored and wealthy kindred spirit, the story has developed all the dizzying cross-currents it deserves. 
The last part of the film, which opens tomorrow, runs into problems.  Eventually tangled up, like Tom, in the particulars of a trail of crime, it tries to use yet another of Tom's attractions (to another new character, played by Peter Smith-Kingsley) to settle his fate. And despite the occasional flash of Hitchcockian magic -- like a scene involving a razor blade in the pocket of a white bathrobe -- there are late scenes that flounder or lag. These concluding events are far less meaningful than the ones that sent Tom on his odyssey of self-invention in the first place. As with any great impostor, there's more to say about where he came from than where he has to go. 
''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief and implied sexual situations, strong sexual undercurrents, profanity and murder.

‽
‽Galaxy Quest‽,‽Whether you love ''Star Trek'' or laugh at it, your starship is about to come in, docking in the form of ''Galaxy Quest,'' an amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable. 
''Galaxy Quest,'' opening tomorrow, spins out of a single joke, about a bunch of washed-up actors from a canceled television series who are enlisted by some credulous interplanetary simpletons to champion them in conflict with a scaly, bellicose villain who has all but exterminated their people. If ''Galaxy Quest'' never attains consistently giddy heights as it plays out its combination of knowing satire and heroic adventure, it nevertheless keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek, offers a few genuine laughs, moves swiftly, if not at warp speed, and is led by a talented cast. 
The crew includes Tim Allen as the egotistical Jason Nesmith. To his legions of fans, he is Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, of the immortal line ''Never give up; never surrender.'' Sigourney Weaver, no stranger to combat with slimy space aliens, plays Gwen DeMarco, known to her fans as Lt. Tawny Madison, the voluptuous communications officer aboard Taggart's ship, Protector. And Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane, who sadly remembers that he once portrayed Richard III in the days before he signed on to become the Spock-like humanoid Dr. Lazarus. 
These actors and Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, alias Tech Sergeant Chen, and Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber, the navigator Lieutenant Laredo, have been reduced to signing autographs at fan shows for $15 a pop and snipping ribbons at supermarket openings when fate (directed by Dean Parisot from a script by David Howard and Robert Gordon) intervenes. 
In a scene that skewers the ubiquitous ''Star Trek'' fan conventions, as the testy, disheartened crew copes with costumed cultists, minutiae-obsessed teenagers and giggling groupies, Nesmith-Taggart is approached by a group of odd creatures he assumes are fans. He dismisses their monotonous babble. 
The next day, after he wakes up on the floor at home, hung over after a night of solitary drinking, they whisk him off to what he thinks is another re-enactment: a negotiation as Taggart with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) on behalf of the gentle Thermians. But when Nesmith-Taggart is miraculously returned, he realizes that he has been aboard a genuine spaceship. 
It seems that the Thermians, led by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), believe the courage- and principle-filled ''Galaxy Quest'' television episodes they have witnessed to be actual historical documents and have sought out Taggart to lead them. 
''Alexander,'' Taggart tells the once and future Dr. Lazarus after he rises to the challenge and enlists his old crew, ''this is the role of a lifetime.'' 
So off they go, joined -- in one of the film's best comic conceptions -- by Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), now a convention organizer but once an obscure bit player who died a quick death in episode 81. Throughout the adventure, as the heroes do battle with Sarris and his minions, encounter cannibalistic space creatures who resemble children, face off against assorted monsters and other perils while standing between the Thermians and extinction, Fleegman remains convinced that being an unknown actor, he is fated by the laws of scriptwriting to perish once more. 
In the parched comic landscape that now stretches over much of planet Earth, ''Galaxy Quest'' may not be a monument to the genre, but it offers a ray of hope for the future. 
''Galaxy Quest'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes a mildly crude word, a standard issue of space monsters and associated violence. 
GALAXY QUEST

Running time: 102 minutes. This film is rated PG. 
WITH: Tim Allen (Jason Nesmith), Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco), Alan Rickman (Alexander Dane), Tony Shalhoub (Fred Kwan), Sam Rockwell (Guy Fleegman), Daryl Mitchell (Tommy Webber), Robin Sachs (Sarris) and Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar). 
‽
‽Any Given Sunday‽,‽As a cinematic flasher of not-so-secret mass culture fantasies, Oliver Stone is Hollywood's R-rated answer to P. T. Barnum. Instead of clowns, aerialists and lion tamers, he parades his own hyper-macho vision of modern American life as a primitive bread-and-circuses carnival of power, greed, lust, fame and violence (especially violence). And in ''Any Given Sunday,'' his viscerally charged, razzle-dazzle ode to professional football as a blood sport, he comes up with some quintessentially zany Oliver Stone moments. 
Take the scene in the locker room of the Miami Sharks in which a heavily muscled naked football player with a mammoth sexual endowment is placed directly in front of the camera. The shot is held for an extra half-beat as if to say: ''Look at it. We all know that this is what football is really about: colliding superstuds whose bedroom conquests we would like to imagine are the erotic equivalent of their stadium feats.'' 
In another scene in which the Sharks' head coach, Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), lectures the hotshot young quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) on being a team player, the movie lards in clips of the climactic chariot race from ''Ben-Hur.'' In case we haven't already gotten the movie's blatant message about football being the home-grown equivalent of a Roman gladiatorial circus, here it is spelled out again. Later the movie actually trots out Charlton Heston for a cameo appearance as the moralizing commissioner of the Associated Football Franchises of America. It should be no surprise that Mr. Stone is as gleefully at home inside a football stadium as he is on the battlefield, since his new movie portrays professional football and wartime combat as variations of the same experience. 
The film's most exciting scenes take place in the bone-crushing thick of the fray, and they provide about as acute a sense of straining muscle and excruciating collision as a football movie could hope to give. Like  battlefield casualties, injured players are rushed off the field on stretchers. And at halftime, the locker room resembles a hospital emergency ward where players who are not too badly injured are frantically sewn up and shot up with painkillers, then sent back into battle. 
Encasing all this action, the director and his collaborators John Logan and Daniel Pyne have erected the shell of a story that is a crude morality play in the style of Mr. Stone's ''Wall Street.'' The biggest struggle pits the old school of football philosophy against the new. That old school is exemplified by the battle-weary Tony D'Amato and the Sharks' loyal but fading star quarterback, the legendary Jack Rooney, known as Cap (Dennis Quaid), who at 39 is nearing the end of his career. Tony and Cap represent a cooperative team-player ethic that is being undermined by big money and the star-making power of television. 
The new school is embodied by the gifted but arrogant and relatively inexperienced Willie, who catapults from third-string quarterback into the Sharks' resident superstar. In a matter of months, Willie has also scored a chart-topping rap hit and landed some lucrative television commercials. But Willie is so green that he throws up before every game. Not groomed to be a team player, he infuriates Tony by calling his own shots in the huddles. But when his spontaneous decisions win games and the Sharks' sagging fortunes start to reverse, Tony's old-school philosophy is increasingly called into question. 
Willie's flash is backed by the Sharks' ruthless owner, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), who inherited the team with her alcoholic mother (Ann-Margret) from her football legend of a father, who was also Tony's mentor. Other moral conflicts pit the Sharks' coldbloodedly pragmatic orthopedist, (and Dr. Feelgood) Harvey Mandrake (James Woods), who risks the lives of the players to keep them in the game at all costs, and its young internist, Oliver Powers (Matthew Modine), who is appalled by Mandrake's reckless decisions. 
For much of the movie, the kinetic furor of the game sequences helps camouflage the weaknesses of a screenplay that is a mechanically contrived series of power struggles, each of which has an issue attached to it. But as the movie develops into a kind of mega-''Rocky'' with a end-of-game sequence that stretches nine seconds of play into many minutes, the strains begin to show. 
Those strains extend to some crucial performances. Mr. Quaid appears several years too old (and not in good enough shape) for his role, and Ms. Diaz, who can be such a winning comedian, is not up to the dramatic demands of her unsympathetic character. But Mr. Pacino's Tony is a solid if well-worn variation on a familiar Pacino type, a weather-beaten not-so-young true believer stretched beyond his limits and forced to re-evaluate his entire life. The movie's revelation is Mr. Foxx's Willie, who gracefully embodies the internal conflicts of a talented, insecure athlete. Embittered by years of racial discrimination and tempted by the rewards of instant celebrity, he struggles not to lose his humanity amid the hoopla. It's a subtle performance in a movie that has nothing else subtle about it. 
As usual, Mr. Stone's attitude toward the frenzy he has conjured is wildly ambivalent. ''Any Given Sunday,'' like so many other Stone films dealing with violence, embraces the visceral Dionysian thrill of professional football with the ecstatic eagerness of a scaredy-cat who has conquered his fear of skydiving and become addicted to jumping out of airplanes. At the same time it is also an expose of professional football and its sins and the mad, mindless excesses of greed, power-mongering, exploitation and phallic worship it enshrines. 
In the end the movie cops out. Although the story presents many opportunities for tragedy (some situations practically beg for it), ''Any Given Sunday'' turns ludicrously upbeat as it hastily ties all its strands together. P. T. Barnum liked happy endings too. Circus lions are in the ring to be tamed, aerialists are expected not to fall. The final message of ''Any Given Sunday'' is one big thumbs up: Let the games begin. 
''Any Given Sunday'' is rated R. It has profanity, sexual situations and lots of playing-field violence.

‽Man on the Moon‽,‽Andy Kaufman's mind games with his audiences played on an element of the unknown. Whether he was treating everyone in Carnegie Hall to milk and cookies or spewing abuse in his corrosive Tony Clifton mode, it was crucial that the viewer never know whether to laugh or squirm. Kaufman's precocious genius for ironic detachment seemed extreme, to the point where his death in 1984 struck even his loved ones as a possible put-on. But time has turned  Kaufman into a hugely influential avatar of confrontational comedy. Jim Carrey, to name just one spiritual descendant, would not be possible without him. 
Now Mr. Carrey delivers an electrifying homage in ''Man on the Moon,'' Milos Forman's vivid re-creation of Kaufman's too-short and enduringly strange career. (The film takes its title from R.E.M.'s ghostly musical tribute to the Kaufman spirit.) In a film that summons its subject's most memorable creative inventions as a series of greatest hits, Mr. Carrey makes a flawless, uncanny impersonator. It's all here: the timid, wide-eyed Foreign Man, the sneering wrestling matches with women, the reading of ''The Great Gatsby'' in its entirety to a dumbfounded college audience, the priceless pantomime of the ''Mighty Mouse'' theme song. 
But what is missing here, though it might have been the first thing expected from an ostensible film biography, is an answer to the simplest question: Who was Andy Kaufman, and how did he get that way? ''Man on the Moon,'' which takes the form of a surprisingly straightforward show business rise-and-fall story, isn't telling. Whether this is a strictly artistic choice or an indication that the generous treatment of Kaufman's agent, girlfriend and immediate family make this a somewhat authorized version, it limits the film's ability to give Kaufman three dimensions. That's a dramatic liability even if you believe, as perhaps the filmmakers do, that Kaufman was no more of a cipher to audiences than he was to himself. 
''Man on the Moon'' is another big, vibrant collaboration between Mr. Forman and the screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Together they brilliantly evoked the world of ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' in all its absurdity and unlikely gravitas. But their new film remains more opaque, perhaps because Kaufman was such a self-conscious figure in the first place. Unlike Mr. Flynt or Ed Wood (whom the writers also summoned so wonderfully in Tim Burton's film), Kaufman does not offer the creative leeway of an unexamined life. 
Hamstrung as it may be, ''Man on the Moon'' is still a formidable piece of work. As it dutifully revisits the milestones of the Kaufman career, the film benefits enormously from Mr. Carrey's way of channeling his character. 
Artfully distilled, the Kaufman happenings (that's what they were) are rendered faithfully yet made tighter and funnier. Without losing Kaufman's penchant for letting an audience twist in the wind, Mr. Carrey adds his own stamp to the material by making it brighter. 
Fleshing out the story of how Kaufman progressed from a middle-class upbringing in Great Neck, N.Y., to the crowd-baiting outer limits of the comedy frontier, the film needs to give him a succession of sounding boards. These include Danny DeVito (one of the film's producers) as the agent George Shaprio, who is given a ''Eureka!'' moment when he is first made privy to a Kaufman put-on, and who later becomes Kaufman's staunch protector. 
Also used here in a similar capacity is Bob Zmuda (played likably by Paul Giamatti), the writing partner and co-conspirator who helped Kaufman create his boorish lounge-act alter ego, Tony Clifton. The unapologetic ugliness and aggression of the Clifton character is, like Kaufman's avid delight in wrestling women (Courtney Love appears as one of them), a kink that the film leaves unexplored. 
''Man on the Moon'' is rated R. It includes profanity and sexual situations involving prostitution. 
MAN ON THE MOON 
Directed by Milos Forman; written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; director of photography, Anastas Michos; edited by Christopher Tellefsen and Lynzee Klingman; music by R.E.M.; production designer, Patrizia Von Brandenstein; produced by Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher; released by Universal Pictures.

‽
‽Stuart Little‽,‽The plucky title character of ''Stuart Little'' may be an adorable three-inch-tall digital mouse, but the scene stealer in this delightful screen adaptation of E. B. White's classic children's book is Stuart's feline nemesis, Snowbell. A white Chinchilla Persian cat played by five nearly identical felines and voiced by Nathan Lane in a sly, streetwise New York accent tinged with hauteur, Snowbell is one of the most fully rounded nonhuman characters to appear in a family film in quite some time. Every imperious toss of Snowbell's head and twitch of his petulantly bowed mouth synchronizes so smoothly with Mr. Lane's dialogue that at times he seems remarkably close to being like a real-life talking cat. 
When Stuart (Michael J. Fox, sounding indefatigably perky and upbeat) is adopted by the Little family and goes to live with them in their cozy Manhattan brownstone, Snowbell is outraged that a mouse should have the status of a family member. Jealous and resentful, he longs to pounce on the new arrival and devour him. And because he is a pampered house cat, he is also mortified at the prospect of becoming a laughing stock among his neighborhood cronies should they discover he is ''a cat owned by a mouse.'' 
In the devious scheme Snowbell contrives to get rid of Stuart, a pair of mice posing as Stuart's biological parents call on the Littles to claim their son and take him off to their dingy home in faraway Brooklyn. 
''Stuart Little'' sustains a lovely balance between enchantment and playfulness as it follows Stuart's travels from orphanage, to Manhattan brownstone, to Brooklyn and back to the Littles. It is especially witty in portraying the difficult adjustments Stuart must make in settling comfortably into a human-scale world. One morning, Stuart nearly drowns when he is accidentally tossed into a washing machine. He also has problems bonding with his new parents' human son, George (Jonathan Lipnicki), who was hoping for a playmate of his own species and size. The two eventually find common ground when Stuart enters the miniature mouse-size world of George's electric train set. 
In the movie's most euphoric moment, the boy and the mouse collaborate in a toy boat race in Central Park that begins as a disaster but turns into an unlikely triumph as Stuart pilots the vessel to victory, navigating the alarmingly choppy waters and resisting the aggressive collisions of competing boats. 
''Stuart Little,'' directed by Rob Minkoff from a screenplay by M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Brooker, blends images of the real New York City with an impressionistic storybook version that captures some of the original book's enchanted mid-1940's ambiance. That period feeling is enhanced by the look and demeanor of Mr. and Mrs. Little. As played by Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis, they embody a young child's-eye view of parents as benign but mysterious figures who inhabit another world. 
In the last third of the movie, the conscience-stricken impostors confess their hoax to Stuart and send him back to Manhattan in the toy roadster George gave him. But will Stuart make it home safely or will Snowbell and his alley cat co-conspirators intercept him? When Stuart gets lost in Central Park and is stalked by several hungry cats who plan to divide him up into portions, the magical city becomes a shadowy nightmarish jungle that is spooky but not too frightening for young children. 
The only element that doesn't completely harmonize with the rest of the film is the visually unremarkable digital figure of Stuart. In a movie where everything else is a surreal storybook version of the commonplace, the character often appears too cartoonish for his environment. Of course, for many children, who will be charmed by this fable about learning how to fit in while standing up for yourself, Stuart's very otherness will be taken as proof that he, like every child who identifies with him, is special. 
''Stuart Little'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some young children might be frightened by scenes in which Stuart's life is in danger.

‽
‽Bicentennial Man‽,‽Receiving a gushy cinematic Christmas card from Robin Williams has become almost an annual rite of commerce. But in trying to be all things to all people, ''Bicentennial Man'' easily takes the cake as the star's most grandiose holiday greeting yet. 
This feel-good millennial allegory, adapted from an Isaac Asimov story (and a novel by Asimov and Robert Silverberg), is directed by Chris Columbus, the pull-every-heartstring maestro behind ''Mrs. Doubtfire.'' It follows the 200-year life (beginning in the year 2005) of a robot who yearns to be human and over two centuries metamorphoses from machine into man. By the end of the movie, the robot, named Andrew, has shed his metallic shell, acquired a central nervous system and turned  into Robin Williams, the misty-eyed, empathetic smiling-through-tears sad clown and shameless ham we all know. 
Like other recent Robin Williams products, this one wants to tickle our funny bones while going for the emotional jugular with drippy, sugar-coated New Age sentiments that  echo ''What Dreams May Come,'' ''City of Angels'' and other recent films that have pretended to be touched by angels. The difference between ''Bicentennial Man'' and those movies is that this time the hokum isn't all spiritualist mumbo jumbo. The possibility of a machine (or a ''household appliance'' as Andrew's manufacturer contemptuously describes him) claiming to have human qualities seems increasingly likely. What's not so likely is that a robot, in seeking to be human, would embrace mortality. 
''Bicentennial Man'' tosses around some ideas about the relationship between humans and machines, and it has some good jokes (the early Andrew trying and failing to grasp the essence of humor) and many clever sight gags. Its wittiest character is a feisty, hip-swinging robot named Galatea (Kiersten Warren) equipped with a personality chip that  makes her sashay to Aretha Franklin's ''Respect.'' 
But in zigzagging between low comedy and high sentiment, the movie never settles into a comfortable narrative track. As it takes huge, awkward leaps forward in time, we don't feel as though we're being given glimpses into the future so much as revisiting a standard ''Star Trek''-style fantasy of topless towers and whizzing little airships. And as the movie keeps jumping forward, its characters acquire layers of increasingly fake-looking prosthetic makeup. Except for Mr. Williams, the sitcom-meets-sci-fi acting  throughout the movie is strictly of television caliber. 
The story begins when Andrew is purchased by Richard Martin (Sam Neill), a clockmaker known throughout the film simply as Sir, to be a robotic servant in his picture-postcard California mansion. Sir (looking and sounding like James Mason's double) is happily married to Ma'am (Wendy Crewson). The couple have two girls, the adorable 7-year-old Amanda, known as Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) and her bratty 9-year-old sister Miss (Lindze Letherman), who orders Andrew to jump out her bedroom window. (He obeys and is seriously damaged and left with a lifelong terror of upper-story views.) 
It is after Andrew accidentally breaks one of Little Miss's precious tiny glass horses and replaces it with an exquisite wooden one of his own making that Sir notices Andrew's  creativity and realizes he's a kind of mechanical mutation and becomes his teacher and legal guardian. As Andrew acquires knowledge and reaps a fortune designing timepieces  (Sir insists that Andrew, although a robot, have his own bank account), he falls unrequitedly in love with the now grown-up Little Miss (Embeth Davidtz), who marries (unhappily) and has children. On requesting and being granted his freedom, Andrew leaves the family to live in his own cozy, self-designed beach house. 
The decades hurtle by, and the next thing you know, Andrew, who now looks human but is still missing some human ingredients, meets Little Miss's grown-up granddaughter Portia (Ms. Davidtz). Technology has advanced to the point where the creation of androids who are facsimile humans is possible. Collaborating with Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a San Francisco scientific genius, Andrew, motivated by his passion for Portia, pursues the seemingly impossible goal of achieving full humanity. 
As befits a Robin Williams movie, the screenplay (by Nicholas Kazan) pours on the sentimentality in lumpy, mawkish speeches about freedom, the joys of sex and the meaning of life. Not even Mr. Williams, pulling out every moist, sad-clown expression in his bag of grimaces, can redeem these speeches from sappiness. But as it lumbers toward a  mystical romantic ending in an early-23rd-century hospital, ''Bicentennial Man'' achieves the pop grandiloquence of a ''Star Trek'' installment. In its warm, fuzzy, self-congratulatory humanistic vision, nothing in the universe beats being a flesh-and-blood mortal. 
''Bicentennial Man'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some fairly candid sexual talk. 
BICENTENNIAL MAN 
Directed by Chris Columbus; written by Nicholas Kazan, based on the short story by Isaac Asimov and the novel ''The Positronic Man'' by Asimov and Robert Silverberg; director of photography, Phil Meheux; edited by Neil Travis; music by James Horner; production designer, Norman Reynolds; produced by Wolfgang Petersen, Gail Katz, Neal Miller, Mr. Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan; released by Touchstone Pictures/ Columbia Pictures.

WITH: Robin Williams (Andrew), Embeth Davidtz (Grown-Up Little Miss/Portia), Sam Neill (Sir), Oliver Platt (Rupert Burns), Kiersten Warren (Galatea Robotic/Human), Wendy Crewson (Ma'am), Hallie Kate Eisenberg (Little Miss at 7) and Lindze Letherman (Miss). 
‽
‽Anna and the King‽,‽If any movie could be said to be haunted (maybe cursed is a better word) by another movie, it is Andy Tennant's picturesque but stodgy ''Anna and the King.'' The film that does the haunting (and the cursing) is the 1956 film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic Broadway musical ''The King and I,'' based on the same material. 
Watching Mr. Tennant's film, which stars Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat in roles played in the earlier movie by Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, you keep expecting the characters to burst into song, but they never do. And because the mostly solemn dramatic tone of ''Anna and the King'' is so similar to that of ''The King and I,'' the absence of songs comes as a letdown. Especially missed when their moments arrive are ''Getting to Know You,'' ''A Puzzlement'' and above all ''Shall We Dance?'' 
Of course it's unfair to ask ''Anna and the King'' to be anything but what it is. But ''The King and I'' has become so deeply embedded in our culture that its version of the true story that inspired Margaret Landon's book ''Anna and the King of Siam'' supersedes all others in much the same way that ''My Fair Lady'' now looms over Shaw's ''Pygmalion.'' (Before ''The King and I,'' Langdon's work had been adapted into a popular nonmusical 1946 movie starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison.) 
What the new film offers in place of songs is lush local color (the film was shot in Malaysia), grand palaces, dazzling pageantry, one heated battle scene, and a much more enlightened, multiculturally sensitive perspective on world affairs than the view offered by the musical. Here the British (with the exception of Anna) are painted as greedy double-dealing industrial merchants deviously promoting a 19th-century version of globalization. Anna ultimately finds herself pulled between her loyalty to Britain and her pained awareness of her countrymen's racism and deceitfulness. 
''Anna and the King'' is also a misstep for the gifted Ms. Foster, an actress who seems more interested these days in sanctifying herself as an old-fashioned heroine than in taking on dramatically risky roles. Adopting a tentative British accent, she plays the title character as a virtuous, nobler-than-thou ice queen and seems even chillier here than she did in ''Contact.'' 
Ms. Foster's late-90's screen personality often suggests that she is aspiring to fill the shoes of the 60's Julie Andrews in spreading high-minded sweetness and light. But she lacks Ms. Andrews's vigor and down-to-earth sense of fun, and even when being playful she emits a certain guardedness, her sharp blue eyes scrutinizing the surroundings for signs of trouble. Three decades ago Ms. Andrews may have been mocked as embodying a reactionary ickiness, but no one accused her of being thin-blooded. 
Ms. Foster's character, Anna Leonowens, a British widow who traveled to Bangkok in 1862 with her young son to be schoolteacher to the 58 children of King Mongkut, was among other things a spirited pioneer taking enormous chances. But Ms. Foster's Anna hardly seems to have a body. Whatever lust for adventure drove the character to make that journey is barely apparent in Ms. Foster's demure, wary performance. 
Mr. Chow's imperious, polygamous King inevitably begs comparison with Brynner's. Although this Hong Kong superstar lends the king an imposing authority (mitigated by moments of softness), his performance lacks Brynner's terrifying thunder. His carefully shaded performance may be many things, but it is never truly scary. 
''Anna and the King'' has the rambling pace of an episodic 1950's costume drama. As Anna and her cheeky young son, Louis (Tom Felton), adjust to their new life in Southeast Asia, there are the inevitable collisions between Siamese and British ways of thinking. Among the many little dramas that unfold, the most significant involves Tuptim (Bai Ling), the king's newest wife, who refuses to be parted from her lover and flees the palace to join him in a Buddhist monastery. 
Later the focus shifts to regional politics and an attempted coup by the rebellious General Alak (Randall Duk Kim). Siamese politics and military strategy might be described in these scenes as the art of the high-stakes bluff. 
In evoking the undeclared, unconsummated love between Anna and the king, the movie is as prim and tight-lipped as its leading lady. And although Mr. Chow can be charming, even charismatic, he lacks Brynner's swashbuckling sensual magnetism. Without any real sparks between the main characters, ''Anna and the King'' unfolds like an exotic historical diorama with dramatic vignettes thrown in for spice. 
''Anna and the King'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of people who have been tortured and one execution.

‽Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo‽,‽Little sex and less humor await audiences for ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' whose juvenile comedy targets a gallery of imperfect women. These include an obese black, a narcoleptic, a victim of Tourette's syndrome and a giant with a runaway pituitary gland. 
The list also includes a woman with an artificial leg, her sightless roommate and a clerk in a pet fish store who can be induced to unwittingly wet her T-shirted breasts while scooping snails from a tank. 
Among the males are a stereotypical black pimp and a cuckolded police detective given to exposing himself while he rails about the imperfection of his sex organ. 
And given that the protagonist of this film is a fish-tank cleaner and rescuer of goldfish from toilets, the term bathroom humor is appropriate, especially since his father is a men's room attendant. 
The problem with ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' whose title seems intended to evoke memories of ''Ace Ventura, Pet Detective,'' is not its low humor. Low humor has a proud history. The problem with ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' directed by Mike Mitchell from a screenplay by Harris Goldberg and Rob Schneider, is the low level of its low humor. 
The high concept behind this tiny achievement is that Deuce, played by Mr. Schneider, is asked to house-sit for Antoine Laconte (Oded Fehr), a gigolo who must leave the country on high-priced business while a valuable fish in his expensive aquarium in his lavish home is ill. 
Leconte gives Deuce two pieces of advice: don't answer the phone and don't drive the Porsche. Not much time passes before Deuce violates the rules, because he has managed to destroy the fish tank and set fire to the premises. 
So Deuce decides to try life as a gigolo to earn money to restore the damage to Leconte's home. And soon he has attracted a hungry, sloppy, fast-talking pimp, T. J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin), and the attentions of the angry detective, Chuck Fowler (William Forsythe), who wants to build a case against Leconte. T. J. also has some advice for Deuce: don't fall in love with a client. 
As Deuce works his way through an assortment of women, learning that compassion, not sex, is what many need, he eventually meets the innocent Kate (Arija Bareikis), whose friends have arranged for his services. And true love begins to run its troubled course. 
Among devotees of comedy, ''Deuce Bigalow'' is for the undemanding. 
''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes simulated sex, visible breasts, foreplay, partial nudity, sexual innuendo, harsh language and violence.

‽
‽The Green Mile‽,‽Two important figures in ''The Green Mile'' happen to be a giant (Michael Clarke Duncan) and a mouse. But when it comes to this extravagantly long death row drama, there are more important matters of proportion to consider. To watch a film this unhurried (three hours) is to choose a companion for a long ocean voyage. It's a risk, and you hope that neither ship nor speaker runs out of steam. 
It happens that ''The Green Mile,'' written by Stephen King at great length and in multiple installments, does not truly warrant such a marathon. It boils down to a well-populated drama with a relatively simple story, one that could have been told with more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. As adapted by Frank Darabont with as much exemplary skill as he brought to Mr. King's other prison tale, ''The Shawshank Redemption,'' it's a film with a counterproductive tendency to take its time. 
But while a tighter film from Mr. Darabont clearly would have been better, ''The Green Mile'' proves surprisingly successful under the circumstances. First and foremost, it manages to linger on death row without claustrophobia and to become wholeheartedly immersed in what goes on there. Working casually, with the bookend flashback device borrowed from ''Saving Private Ryan,'' it eases into the story of what the very Southern-sounding Paul Edgecomb remembers about his years as a prison guard. Tom Hanks, who is so unaffectedly good that it has become redundant to say so, helps ease the film into its just-folks storytelling mode. 
Edgecomb's bladder problems, which are the sort of thing on which Mr. Darabont might have spent less time, help set up the chatty back-and-forth of life on the Green Mile. (This place, where condemned men take their last walks, got its nickname from the color of its floor.) We meet Edgecomb's fellow guard Brutus Howell, called Brutal (David Morse, who shares Mr. Hanks' laid-back timing and sly delivery). Their colleague and nemesis is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), who is ''the governor's wife's nephew'' and acts accordingly. There are more Green Mile regulars (including James Cromwell as the warden), and each one drops his jaw when Mr. Duncan's John Coffey arrives on the scene. 
Although the colossal Coffey supposedly killed and raped two children, he is a gentle soul. In fact when a mouse turns up as an uninvited pet, Coffey seems delighted. (So do the guards; that's the kind of place this is.) And then, in a scene with the mouse that actually elicited shrieks from a preview audience, another side of Coffey emerges. Finally there is a connection between the business of executing prisoners and the film's strenuously spiritual side. 
''The Green Mile'' involves assorted acts of cruelty and one lurid, extended electrocution scene that makes the horrors of the death penalty grotesquely clear, but much of it is very gentle. The mystical healing of Edgecomb's bladder trouble brings on some funny moments with Bonnie Hunt, who does a charming turn as his wife. Coffey's peculiar innocence is also given a lot of screen time. The way in which this huge black man, who calls the guards Boss, is given a magical capacity for self-sacrifice has its inadvertently racist overtones as well as its Christlike ones. But as Mr. Duncan plays him, Coffey is too flabbergasting a figure to be easily pigeonholed anyhow. 
Mr. Darabont keeps the winding story of ''The Green Mile'' on track while also providing endless opportunities for the actors to shine. The guards' camaraderie (with Barry Pepper as another group member) is droll and engaging, while the prisoners make another kind of strong impression. Harry Dean Stanton brings some bizarre fun to the process of testing electrocution equipment, which is, of course, also rendered with appropriate horror. Sam Rockwell provides loads of local color as the worst, most hateful miscreant ever to wind up on death row. And some characters are allowed to wear out their welcomes before their time is up. There is one overwritten pre-execution speech too many in Mr. Darabont's screenplay. 
As ''The Green Mile'' builds to its inevitable spooky touches -- very few, since this King story concentrates so heavily on character -- its drama mounts even as its seams begin to show. There will turn out to have been much ado about relatively little when the film is over. But unassumingly strong, moving performances and Mr. Darabont's durable storytelling make it a trip worth taking just the same. 
''The Green Mile'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, profanity and some very grisly moments.

‽Toy Story 2‽,‽''Toy Story 2'' can be enjoyed -- enormously -- without wondering exactly why the Pixar animation looks even better than it did the first time. Among the many talents of the director, John Lasseter, and his huge crew of computer-animation pioneers is a gift for making their work look easy. 
Only after leaving the theater is there reason to realize just how much imagination has gone into making this film so enveloping. While its surface is as smooth and witty as that of ''Toy Story'' itself, the sequel and its characters (in the words of an associate technical director) are ''probably twice as complicated under the hood.'' 
This cutting-edge animation franchise still has the power to enchant children while keeping adults entertained. And it has not wasted its technical innovations on junk-food storytelling. Mr. Lasseter's avowed fondness for Frank Capra's films can be seen in the nostalgic world summoned here, and in the fundamental goodness of the toy characters themselves. Without undue sentimentality, this film lets its playthings pull together in ways that would be sweet and funny in any format. 
''Toy Story 2'' begins with a perfectly adorable ''Star Wars'' parody and manages to stay on that same level throughout. With voices delightfully supplied by an even larger cast of familiar actors than the first film had, it sends up video-game heroics before returning Buzz Lightyear, toy astronaut (with the voice of Tim Allen), to the haven known as Andy's room. 
Andy is the child whom the toys worship (perhaps a shade more slavishly than they should), and Andy's going to camp is enough to set a toy crisis in motion. This may be a world in which a yard sale is a big event, but the film invests plenty of feeling in its assorted metaphorical happenings. 
When Woody the cowboy (with the voice of Tom Hanks) accidentally falls into the clutches of a wicked toy collector (played by Wayne Knight, and cleverly rendered right down to the hairs on his arms), the film's value system makes itself known. It turns out that Woody was once a toy celebrity, famous enough to have knocked Sputnik off the cover of a 1957 issue of Life magazine. He got his face on a lunch box in those days, and now he has become an icon of sorts. Flattered by fame, and welcomed by a group of equally collectible friends (with the voices of Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer), he may be in danger of forsaking his old gang for the chance to be lionized. The film manages to make being put into storage, or being displayed in a toy museum in Japan, into workable metaphors for failure and success. 
Of course the filmmakers have spun a lively, tuneful adventure (with a score by Randy Newman, and Sarah MacLachlan and Robert Goulet to enliven the soundtrack) out of this setup. But what they have also done is to add layers of new facial and body movements for the characters, along with much subtler lighting effects (50 separate light sources in once scene, according to the cinematographer, Sharon Calahan). 
Motion is so fine-tuned that the film can stage high adventure in traffic, on baggage-moving machinery at an airport or anywhere else that comes to mind. Like the Japanese landmark ''Princess Mononoke,'' this kind of animation catapults past reality to create whole new realms of imagination. 
Meanwhile, back on the toy shelf, appealingly human emotions are put in play. Buzz discovers that he is only one of many Buzzes, and must come to terms with existential questions about being mass-produced, one of the crowd. Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) now has a wife (Estelle Harris), who offers to pack ''your Angry Eyes, just in case'' when her mate goes off to rescue Woody. 
The toys have their own enemies (including a hilarious take on Darth Vader), their own nightmares (being relegated to the broken-toy heap) and their own triumphs (just getting across a busy street) that take on epic proportions here. And this film continues the work of its predecessor, making sure that computer-generated animation will never be the same.

‽Flawless‽,‽Joel Schumacher's garish, message-laden comedy, ''Flawless,'' is so awful it just might put an end to Hollywood's hypocritical infatuation with men in drag as symbols of its own supposedly liberated sexual attitudes. If so, that would be an unintended benefit. 
Set on Manhattan's Lower East Side and fluffed out with foolish subplots involving stolen drug money and a drag queen beauty contest, the movie is essentially a comic duet for two gifted actors putting the best possible faces on roles that are little more than one-dimensional mouthpieces. 
Robert De Niro is Walt Koontz, a retired New York policeman who falls into a depression after he is disabled by a stroke suffered while trying to foil a robbery in an upstairs neighbor's apartment. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Rusty, his drag- queen neighbor who ends up giving Walt speech therapy in the form of singing lessons. Those lessons turn out to be much more than vocal exercises (one assignment is to learn to sing the tongue-twisting Shirley Ellis hit, ''The Name Game''). 
They are lessons in courage and compassion proffered by an oppressed but indomitable spirit who knows the meaning of suffering and rejection. By the end of the movie, the once rabidly homophobic policeman has clearly melted under Rusty's campy tutelage. 
''Flawless'' means well, heaven knows. But its caricatures of the transvestized and the transgendered (Rusty, who is saving money to have a sex-change operation fits both definitions) reinforces every negative stereotype ascribed to gay men in drag. Rusty is hysterical, masochistic, voracious, self-loathing and ragingly ''on'' every minute of her waking day. Her noisy posse of friends look and act like shallow, preening gargoyles revving up for a never-ending Halloween drag ball. They are about as real as Broadway's ''Cats.'' 
Desperate for sharp one-liners, the screenplay recycles cliches, then tries to palm them off as fresh. ''There's no romance without finance,'' Rusty remarks, when explaining her relationship with a macho married man who abuses her but expects her to pay his gambling debts. When Rusty gets angry at Walt, she hits him with that now-standard refrain, ''I'm more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get.'' 
Meanwhile Walt learns some lessons about romance and finance from two women he knows from the local tango palace. The one he has admired as a lady turns out to be a mercenary who dumps him when he is disabled and strapped for cash, while the one he has dismissed as a whore turns out to have a heart of gold. 
Mr. De Niro brings a deep, brooding quiet to his role that makes Walt more than a stick-figure bigot. The actor makes you feel the humiliation and terror of a proudly independent man who suddenly must relearn how to speak while facing the possibility of having no sexual future. Mr. Hoffman brings an angry heat to a stunt role that is even flashier than his turns in ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Happiness.'' Unlike Mr. De Niro, he makes you aware every second that he is giving a carefully shaped, larger-than-life performance. It's probably the only way an actor could have approached a role that feels like a hollow construction crammed with the filmmaker's unexamined emotional baggage. 
''Flawless'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The profanity is nonstop.

‽End of Days‽,‽In ''End of Days,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger assumes the cruciform position in a church as he modestly tackles the role of Jericho Cane, someone who could keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years. ''This is as pro-religious a movie as you can make,'' the film's director, Peter Hyams, recently told Variety. ''This is about the biggest action star of the past 20 years putting the gun down and saying the only thing that works is faith.'' What that statement overlooks is that it takes two ridiculous blood-soaked hours for Mr. Schwarzenegger to part company with his weapon. 
Like a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic action films, ''End of Days'' presents Jericho as a near-suicidal (''Lethal Weapon'') ex-cop. Its idea of a subtle character flourish is giving him a ballerina music box, which makes him think sadly of his wife and daughter. They were killed because he was too busy to be home much, but by-the-numbers Hollywood screenwriting has ways to assuage such guilt. Jericho will be given a second chance: he can try to save Christine York (Robin Tunney) from becoming the mother of Satan's child (''Rosemary's Baby''). 
Gabriel Byrne, who has a much snappier role, plays Satan with an evil grin and a slick corporate edge (''Devil's Advocate''). Actually, Mr. Byrne merely plays an investment banker who happens to be overtaken by Satan in the men's room of a restaurant. The essence of evil, which looks like throbbing plexiglass with attitude (''Predator''), enters the banker's body with a great show of demonic possession (''The Exorcist''). Once a nice guy, the banker returns to the dining room, walks over to a woman in a low-cut dress and simply grabs her breast. Then he kisses her, and she enjoys it. The episode may not say much about Satanism. But it does indicate something about the guys who made this movie. 
It turns out that Satan must mate with Christine before New Year's Eve 1999, and that a battle royal is being waged over Christine's future. In one of the film's earliest and kookiest scenes, the infant Christine was whisked from the maternity ward to the morgue and suckled with snake's blood while Satanists prayed in Latin. Since then she has been carefully watched by a stepmother. The stepmother at least has a chance to slug Mr. Schwarzenegger when the action gets going. 
''End of Days,'' which is as incoherent about its mysticism as it is about anything else, interrupts stretches of doomsday exposition with the inevitable chases and shootouts and beatings that are its raison d'etre. One character tears out his own tongue, keeps it in a jar, and eventually winds up crucified on the ceiling of a hospital room. These are the kinds of hints that persuade Jericho of the urgency of his mission. 
With Kevin Pollak as his wisecracking sidekick, Mr. Schwarzenegger eventually cuts through the religious forces on either side of him and begins to deliver a mean-spirited quip or two. (''I'm not afraid to die,'' says his enemy. ''Good,'' says the star, ''because I'm not afraid to kill you.'') Looking trim and rested in his first film since ''Batman and Robin,'' he moves confidently from crisis to crisis, but can't get past much of the sheer absurdity here. It is no longer possible to believe in special-effects shots that show him hanging one-handed from a very tall building, for instance. As for the film's millennial pretensions, they don't amount to much more than billboards reading ''NY2K Where Will You Be?'' A possible answer, to cite one of numerous better movies around: anywhere but here. 
''End of Days'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violent, grisly scenes, some involving religious imagery, and brief, bizarre sexual situations.

‽A Force More Powerful‽,‽One of the most stunning images from Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, ''Gandhi,'' is the line upon line upon line of protesters standing up to British oppression by lying down, or allowing themselves to be knocked down. What Gandhi did was undeniably momentous. He invented and taught passive resistance based on the Hindu concept of satyagraha, the assertion of truth through firmness and patience, and as a result won India its independence. Luckily, early-20th-century movie cameras were around to record much of it. 
The cinematic possibilities in Gandhi's accomplishment make it all the sadder that ''A Force More Powerful,'' a documentary about nonviolent protest written, directed and produced by Steve York, has taken such a formal approach. The film, which opens today at the Screening Room, conveys valuable information, but with the imagination and liveliness of a high school history lecture. 
Moviegoers will learn dates and the names of some true unsung heroes, but in unmemorable ways. Even the screen titles are academic: ''I. India,'' ''II. Nashville, Tenn.'' and ''III. South Africa.'' 
''Nashville,'' the best-told story, introduces the Rev. James Lawson Jr., a young Methodist minister who worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Lawson taught the principles of passive resistance to young black people in Tennessee in preparation for the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960. The film of their rehearsals and of the sit-ins is fascinating, as is a brief early appearance by Dr. King on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. 
The relatively unknown hero of South Africa's victory over apartheid is Mkhuseli Jack, who led consumer boycotts beginning in 1985. Gandhi's story began in Africa too, where he lived from the early 1890's to 1914. When he staged peaceful protests there, Jan Smuts, then the country's interior minister, told him: ''You reduce me to helplessness. How can we lay hands on you without looking like villains?'' 
That was the point, of course, and the method continues to work miracles.

‽
‽Sleepy Hollow‽,‽The year is 1799 and ''the millennium is almost upon us,'' according to the newly dashing Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's enthusiastically bleak new movie. And speaking of dashing, when Ichabod gallops north from New York City, he rides up the west bank of the Hudson River although the village of Sleepy Hollow is on the east. But an ornate visual fantasy of Mr. Burton's can be expected to make its own rules, and ''Sleepy Hollow'' does that with macabre gusto. His idea of a beautiful day may be somebody else's nuclear winter, but Mr. Burton eagerly brings his visions of sugarplums to the screen. 
So when it comes to appearances, this dark, shivery ''Sleepy Hollow'' manages to be as distinctively Burtonesque as ''Edward Scissorhands'' or ''Batman.''  Offering a serenely unrecognizable take on Washington Irving's story and its famously unlucky schoolteacher, the film brings its huge reserves of creativity to bear upon matters like the severing of heads. Quaint Dutch burghers of the Hudson Valley could have bowled ninepins throughout Rip Van Winkle's sleep-in with the supply of decapitated heads sent flying here, even if Mr. Burton handles such sequences with his own brand of wit. Shot 1: Sword approaches victim. Shot 2: Blood splashes Ichabod's glasses. Shot 3: Head rolls away.  Shot 4: Body pitches forward. Pause for laugh. 
History will recognize the rich imagination and secret tenderness of Mr. Burton's best films. (From a purely technical standpoint, as in the award-ready cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, this grimly voluptuous ''Sleepy Hollow'' must be one of them.) But it will also raise the question of what we were smoking during this period of infatuation with grisliness on screen. It is not unreasonable to admire Mr. Burton immensely without wanting to peer at the exposed brain stems of  his characters, but ''Sleepy Hollow'' leaves no choice. As written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who took off Gwyneth Paltrow's head in ''Seven'' and apparently considered that small potatoes, ''Sleepy Hollow'' turns the tale of the Headless Horseman into the pre-tabloid story of a rampaging serial killer. 
There are reasons to be troubled by this, and they aren't about squeamishness. Mr. Walker's credits also include ''Fight Club,'' a genuinely daring effort to make sense of the violent impulses of buttoned-down young men, and to plumb those dangers found at the nexus of popular culture and political fanaticism.  That, at least, had the hallmarks of something different, and it involved a much lower body count than the one racked up by the Headless Horseman. But ''Sleepy Hollow,'' in the guise of an exotic fable and horror-film homage, offers little such ballast. For all its visual cleverness, it's much more conventionally conceived than Mr. Burton's admirers would expect. 
Even birds nesting in one of the film's vast, wintry indoor sets found themselves trying to get away, moving into the only blossom-filled backdrop that ''Sleepy Hollow'' uses (for brief fantasy scenes). But the bulk of the film unfolds in a forbidding, fairy-tale village and forest that are as ambitious as the Gotham City of ''Batman.'' It is here that Ichabod, who now has a faintly English accent and Mr. Depp's playful charisma, is sent to solve a series of murders and to find that everyone in Sleepy Hollow looks mildly suspect. It is also here that he learns of the vengeful headless Hessian (Christopher Walken in redundant fright makeup)  who is the town's main tourist attraction. 
Using a color palette more often associated with stories of the gulag, ''Sleepy Hollow'' creates a landscape so daunting that even a large tree bleeds. At moments like the one revealing the tree's bloody secret, and in a couple of incidents involving witchcraft, Mr. Burton's film delivers a scare or two, but most of it is too tongue in cheek for that. As this film's Ichabod conducts a Holmesian murder investigation and even unearths a village conspiracy, he has much better luck with Katrina Van Tassel than any traditional Ichabod ever did. Katrina is played photogenically by Christina Ricci, who gets through the film gamely while remaining very much a sardonic creature of her own time. 
An impressive cast shows off Colleen Atwood's sumptuous costumes and delivers dialogue, some apparently worked on by Tom Stoppard, sometimes graced with a clever edge. Miranda Richardson swishes dangerously through the proceedings as Katrina's obviously wicked stepmother, while the town elders include Michael Gough, Michael Gambon and Jeffrey Jones. The horror patriarch Christopher Lee is here, as well he ought to be. And Marc Pickering plays the teenage sidekick whom Ichabod cautions, as he might the audience, with ''I hope you have a strong stomach.'' 
Among the many scenes of cheeky mayhem, one finds a little boy cowering beneath floorboards while the Horseman harvests the heads of his parents. In case you were thinking of  taking the children. 
''Sleepy Hollow'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes fanciful gore and violence, brief sexual situations and a high head count.

‽Mansfield Park‽,‽''My God, this is 1806, for heaven's sake!'' a character exclaims in ''Mansfield Park,'' Patricia Rozema's smart, politically pointed screen adaptation of Jane Austen's third novel. This reminder of how every age foolishly fancies itself the most progressive and enlightened in the history of the world is drenched in irony. And it speaks to the heart of a film that is determined to invest Austen with as many prickly contemporary resonances as it can shoehorn in without appearing wildly anachronistic. 
''Mansfield Park'' takes special pains to remind us that the glory of the British empire and the comfortable life of the novel's landed gentry were the products of colonial exploitation. Where the novel alludes to the slave trading business of Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), the pompous authoritarian who owns the estate called Mansfield Park, the movie rubs our faces in his dirty business. 
The novel's rather meek central character, Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), has been retooled and pumped up for the film into a spunky Jane Austen stand-in who recites directly to the camera fragments from Austen's letters and diaries. The movie's Fanny is an ambitious, willful writer from a poor background whose unstoppable intellectual drive is synonymous with her integrity. Her categorical rejection of Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola), a wealthy aristocratic dreamboat whom Sir Thomas insists she marry, marks her as a proto-feminist heroine who risks losing everything by standing up to male authority. 
Other modern touches include blatant drug addiction and hints of lesbianism. Sir Thomas's wife, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan), is a bleary-eyed, nodding-out junkie in the thrall of the opiate laudanum. Fanny's friendship with Henry's sophisticated, scheming sister, Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who looks so much like Fanny she could almost be her twin, has a strong lesbian undercurrent, and in one scene the two women narrowly avoid falling into a passionate kiss. In another scene (not in the novel), Fanny discovers Henry in bed with someone else's wife. Fanny, although suitably appalled, appears to know enough about the birds and the bees not to require smelling salts after barging in on the pair in full sexual gallop. 
In the hands of a less talented filmmaker, this extensive tinkering and modernizing might seem irritating and pretentious. But in peering beneath Austen's genteel surfaces and scraping away the Hollywood gloss that traditionally accrues to screen adaptations of Austen, Ms. Rozema has made a film whose satiric bite is sharper than that of the usual high-toned romantic costume drama. 
Accentuating the aspects of ''Mansfield Park'' that lend it the aura of a feminist fable about women, power and money, Ms. Rozema turns it into the story of a clever, willful woman who grits her teeth and, in a reckless gamble, evades the dictates of an oppressive patriarchal society. One of the chief obstacles to Fanny's self-fulfillment is her poverty. Sent by her poor family in Portsmouth to live with wealthy relatives in Mansfield Park, she is treated like a servant and told that her lack of means has made her an unlikely candidate for a good marriage. The autocratic Sir Thomas, who rules the palace, ignores Fanny until she matures into a pretty young thing, at which point he can barely keep his hands off her. 
One element of the story Ms. Rozema hasn't updated is Fanny's abiding love for Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller), Sir Thomas's goody-goody bookworm of a younger son, who forgoes the family business to become a clergyman. In keeping with 19th-century romantic convention, it isn't until the very end that Edmund comes to his senses and realizes that Fanny (and not Mary, who in one startling scene reveals herself to be a kind of period Joan Collins character) is the love of his life. 
The film's portrayal of early-19th-century affluence is notably more austere than in other film adaptations of Austen, which surround the characters in ruffles and flourishes. Mansfield Park is an imposing but sparsely accommodated palace whose overall grimness mirrors the constricting puritanical morality of English society and Fanny's prisonlike confinement within social convention. Casting Ms. Duncan in the dual roles of Fanny's impoverished mother (who married for love and ended up in desperate straits) and her well-to-do but drug-addicted aunt, Lady Bertram, suggests the harsh choices forced on women in those days. 
The absence of frilly decor also allows the director to concentrate on the characters. Ms. O'Connor's likable Fanny suggests a quick-witted, wised-up 90's version of a 1940's Jennifer Jones heroine. Biting his lips and looking alternately sheepish and pious, Mr. Miller reins in his swashbuckling energy to make a credibly humble Edmund. Mr. Nivola's Henry conveys the pouting narcissism lurking just beneath a surface charm. But the movie's most imposing performance is Mr. Pinter's thunderous Sir Bertram. A quintessential 19th-century English patriarch, he is the embodiment of an overweening male authority, which the upstart Fanny and subsequent generations of rebellious women feel impelled to disobey. 
The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.

‽Liberty Heights‽,‽Baltimore has been awfully good to Barry Levinson. Whenever this gifted filmmaker seems in danger of succumbing to Hollywood's schlockiest temptations, he dips  back into the personal memory bank of his Baltimore boyhood and comes up with something sweet and heartfelt. In ''Liberty Heights,'' his fourth Baltimore-based film, Mr. Levinson pores over the social traumas and cultural trivia of 1950's America as reflected in his native city with the concentration of a diehard nostalgist minutely inspecting the still-visible scars of his own hypersensitive adolescence. 
In remembering the virulent anti-Semitism and racism of Baltimore in the mid-1950's, this warmly sentimental, sometimes very funny film subscribes to the notion propagated by countless other movies, television shows and rock 'n' roll histories that America was more or less born in the mid-1950's; before that were the dark ages. And in a way it's true. With the rise of television, rock 'n' roll and the teenage car culture, the  shell of America's devouring pop fun house was already in place by 1954, the year  'Liberty Heights'' begins. 
The obvious problems facing any movie revisiting such familiar territory are finding a fresh point of view and coming up with characters who transcend the pre-''Happy Days'' teenage stereotypes we know too well. The strategy of ''Liberty Heights'' is to build an atmosphere that is so intensely true to the period that you can't help but dream its dreams and be caught up in its tensions. 
''Liberty Heights'' remembers this era through the eyes of two brothers, teenage Ben (Ben Foster) and the slightly older Van (Adrien Brody), growing up in a middle-class Jewish family in the mostly Jewish northwest section of Baltimore. The most irritating symbol of their uncertain status in a gentile-dominated world is a country club with a posted sign at the entrance reading  ''No Jews, dogs or coloreds allowed.'' The boys' father, Nate (Joe Mantegna), runs a discreet numbers racket and operates a burlesque house with two partners. And some of the movie's wittiest moments recreate pieces of vintage burlesque skits. Their mother, Ada (Bebe Neuwirth), is tight-lipped, puritanical and devoted to her husband. A meddlesome but good-hearted grandmother is also on the premises. 
Much as Mr. Levinson's 1982 film ''Diner'' did, ''Liberty Heights'' focuses on the boys' fumbling rites of passage, but here the time is two or three years earlier. Again, Mr. Levinson shows a special knack for capturing the boastful, clinging camaraderie and cultural fetishes of innocents trying to invent themselves in a more restrictive era. Masking their anxiety in foolish braggadocio and speculation, they swap apocryphal sexual lore while pining after forbiddingly unattainable goddesses. 
Ben develops a crush on Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), a sensible, well-mannered middle-class black girl in his high school, and the pair sneak out on a chaste date in which she instructs him to huddle below the front seat of the car so they won't be seen together. Van pines for Dubbie (Carolyn Murphy), a haughty horseback-riding debutante he meets at a Halloween party where she is dressed as a fairy princess waving a wand. 
''Liberty Heights'' is a leisurely paced series of anecdotes that jump from character to character to create the sense of a society in accelerating flux. The most dramatic sequence crosscuts from a James Brown concert at which Ben discovers the thrill of soul music to a high-toned teenage society bash attended by an anxious Van searching for his dream girl. 
The movie has some lovely comic touches. Ben, whose voice-over narration frames the story, is astounded to discover the existence of a gentile world where people consume bread that isn't toasted. In another scene, a friend of Van's, visiting an elegant WASP manor with lavishly furnished antiques and expensive rugs, naively assumes that a family that can't afford wall-to-wall carpeting and Formica tables must be poor or very stingy. 
''Liberty Heights'' pointedly compares anti-Semitism with the far more severe prejudice against blacks, who are shunned by WASPS and Jews alike in mid-1950's Baltimore. 
In the most serious plot turn, Nate and his partners come up with a promising new twist on their numbers racket, which backfires when Little Melvin (Orlando Jones), a black drug dealer who has placed 50-to-1 odds on a number that carries a bonus, unexpectedly wins $100,000. Lacking the money to pay the prize, Nate is forced to bargain with Little Melvin, with disastrous consequences for Nate and his family. 
But because ''Liberty Heights'' looks back through Ben's and Van's youthful eyes, even the harshest turn of events wears a misty nostalgic glow. The family dynamics remain unexplored, as do the darker aspects of Nate's profession. Mr. Mantegna's Nate is a model father, husband and breadwinner who just happens to be operating outside the law. His sons are just as lovingly drawn. Mr. Foster's Ben is a likable all-American boy who even when rebelling (one Halloween he dresses up like Hitler) is essentially sweet-natured and pliable. Mr. Brody's Van is surprisingly soft-edged, given the hopped-up energy that the actor effuses almost like perspiration. 
But if ''Liberty Heights'' is much too soft at its center, it still offers a deeper immersion in that old 50's feeling than any other Hollywood film in recent memory. As its inviting period soundtrack fills in the background and its youthful characters lurch through their pseudo-sophisticated rituals of rebellion and desire, the gawky sincerity of an earlier era comes stumbling back, a little tipsy and poignantly alive. 
''Liberty Heights'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, a glimpse of nudity and some strong language.
